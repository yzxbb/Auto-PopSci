    "synopsis": "In a bustling Body City, two enzyme brothers named COX-1 and COX-2 control pain and inflammation. When villainous Inflammation attacks, the superhero Aspirin arrives to block their prostaglandin-making powers! But Aspirin accidentally stops helpful COX-1 from protecting Stomach Village and Platelet Town. Scientist detectives like John Vane and Felix Hoffman help create new heroes \u2013 COX-2 blockers and Nitroaspirin \u2013 who fight smartly while keeping Body City safe. Discover how a willow tree\u2019s ancient secret became modern medicine\u2019s mightiest warrior!",
    "content": "Deep in your body lies a bustling city where tiny enzyme workers called COX-1 and COX-2 control important jobs. COX-1 is like a friendly construction worker \u2013 he protects your stomach from acid, helps blood cells stick together when you get a cut, and keeps your kidneys happy. His brother COX-2 is usually quiet, but when germs attack or you sprain your ankle, he sounds the alarm by making fiery prostaglandin messengers that cause swelling, pain, and fever!\n\nFor thousands of years, people chewed willow bark (nature\u2019s aspirin) to calm these fires. In 1897, a clever chemist named Felix Hoffman created a better version in his lab \u2013 meet Aspirin, the pain-fighting superhero! But nobody knew how Aspirin worked until 1971, when detective scientist John Vane made an amazing discovery.\n\n'COX brothers, I\u2019m shutting down your prostaglandin factory!' Aspirin declares, placing special 'stop signs' (acetyl groups) on their tools. But there\u2019s a problem \u2013 while stopping mean COX-2\u2019s fire alarms is good, blocking helpful COX-1 causes tummy troubles and makes blood take longer to clot.\n\nScientists soon realized the COX brothers have slightly different worksites. Though Aspirin blocks both, COX-2\u2019s workshop has more space. Some prostaglandins sneak through, making Aspirin better at fighting fevers than completely stopping inflammation.\n\nThis discovery led to new heroes! Celecoxib and Rofecoxib are like specialized firefighters who only block COX-2\u2019s alarms. Nitroaspirin wears a protective shield (nitric oxide) to guard Stomach Village while fighting fires. There\u2019s even a mysterious COX-3 cousin discovered by Chandrasekharan\u2019s team, who might control headaches!\n\nOur aspirin adventure shows how medicines can be both helpers and troublemakers. Thanks to scientists\u2019 detective work, we now have smarter superheroes that fight pain while keeping Body City safe. Next time you see a willow tree, remember \u2013 its secret powers launched one of medicine\u2019s greatest stories!"
