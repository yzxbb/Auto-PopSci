    "synopsis": "Discover how aspirin, a medicine used for over 100 years, works like a superhero inside your body! Learn its ancient roots in willow bark, how it blocks 'ouch signals,' and why scientists are still improving it today.",
    "content": "Have you ever scraped your knee and felt throbbing pain or gotten a fever that made your head feel like a hot balloon? Your body sends special chemicals called *prostaglandins* (pro-stuh-GLAN-dins) to those spots, like tiny alarm bells shouting, 'Ouch! Swell up! Get hot!' But guess what? A tiny pill named aspirin can be the superhero that stops those alarms!\n\n**From Willow Bark to Wonder Pill**\nLong ago, people chewed willow tree bark to ease pain. Scientists later found it contained *salicylic acid*, a natural painfighter. But this acid made tummies upset! In 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffman created a gentler version: *aspirin*. His dad, who had arthritis, could finally take it without feeling sick!\n\n**The Superhero\u2019s Secret Power**\nIn 1971, scientist John Vane discovered aspirin\u2019s superpower: it blocks two enzymes called *COX-1* and *COX-2*. Imagine these enzymes as factories making prostaglandins. COX-1 is a *good factory*\u2014it makes prostaglandins that protect your stomach lining. COX-2 is a *troublemaker*\u2014it makes prostaglandins that cause swelling, fevers, and pain. Aspirin swoops in like a superhero, sticking to both factories and shutting them down!\n\n**Oops\u2026 Sometimes Heroes Make Mistakes**\nBut wait! If aspirin blocks the *good* COX-1 factory too, your stomach might get irritated. That\u2019s why scientists invented *COX-2 blockers*\u2014new medicines that only stop the troublemaker factory. Now, people can fight pain without tummy aches!\n\n**A Pill for the Future**\nAspirin isn\u2019t just for headaches anymore! Doctors give low doses to adults to prevent heart attacks because it stops blood cells from clumping. Scientists are even creating \u2018smart\u2019 aspirins that protect your stomach while they work. Who knew one tiny pill could do so much?\n\nSo next time you see aspirin, remember: it\u2019s not magic\u2014it\u2019s science! And just like superheroes in stories, scientists keep making it better. (But always ask a grown-up before taking any medicine\u2014real superheroes stay safe!)"
