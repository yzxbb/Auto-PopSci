2-billion-year-old rock home to living microbes,"You have full access to thisopen accessarticle 28kAccesses 590Altmetric 90Mentions Explore all metrics Recent advances in subsurface microbiology have demonstrated the habitability of multi-million-year-old igneous rocks, despite the scarce energy supply from rock-water interactions. Given the minimal evolution coupled with exceedingly slow metabolic rates in subsurface ecosystems, spatiotemporally stable igneous rocks can sustain microbes over geological time scales. This study investigated a 2-billion-year-old mafic rock in the Bushveld Igneous Complex, South Africa, where ultradeep drilling is being executed by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). New procedures were successfully developed to simultaneously detect indigenous and contaminant microbial cells in a drill core sample. Precision rock sectioning coupled with infrared, fluorescence, and electron microscopy imaging of the rock section with submicron resolution revealed microbial colonization in veins filled with clay minerals. The entry and exit of microbial cells in the veins are severely limited by tight packing with clay minerals, the formation of which supplies energy sources for long-term habitability. Further microbiological characterization of drilled rock cores from the Bushveld Igneous Complex will expand the understanding of microbial evolution in deep igneous rocks over 2 billion years.

The terrestrial subsurface is defined by depths greater than 8 m from the ground surface, excluding soil [1], where a significant portion of the Earth’s prokaryotic biomass resides [2,3,4]. The metabolic activities of subsurface microbiomes are exceedingly slow under survival mode [5,6], leading to an estimated turnover time ranging from several thousand to million years. Consistent with the long turnover time [7], sulfate-reducing bacteriaCandidatusDesulforudis audaxviator endemic to the deep subsurface have undergone minimal evolution since 55–165 million years ago [8]. Similarly, minimal evolution over geological time scales has been demonstrated for deep subsurface archaeal lineages calledCandidatusAltiarchaeota [9]. Based on the ecological and evolutionary features of subsurface microbiomes, it is hypothesized that microbes can be sustained with minimal evolution for billions of years in a geologically and tectonically stable subsurface environment [10]. The basement of the oceanic and continental crust is dominated by igneous rocks. Microbiological studies of the igneous basement have been intensively studied by sampling fluids from drilled boreholes [11]. In cases where collecting pristine fluid samples was technically difficult or impossible, drilled rock cores were used for microbiological characterization. For example, in the Oman ophiolite complex, ~ 100-million-year-old (Ma) mantle peridotite was drilled by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). To examine contamination, fluorescent microspheres were added to the drilling fluid and counted in the crushed and homogenized drill core samples [12]. Cells were separated from rock particles, and then DNA-stained cells with SYBR Green I were counted by flow cytometry [13]. The cell density was up to six orders of magnitude higher at fractures and veins (~ 107cells/g) than in the rock matrix (~ 101–2cells/g) [12]. In another example, 100-million-year-old basaltic oceanic crust was drilled by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) in the South Pacific Gyre, using fluorescent microspheres in the drilling fluid for contamination control [14,15]. In addition to contamination control using fluorescent microspheres and microbial cells extracted from the bulk rocks with ultra-low cell abundances, new visualization approaches were successfully developed to enumerate microbial cell densities at fractures and veins that exceeded 1010cells/cm3[14,15]. This contribution extends the formation age of igneous rocks for microbiological investigations by targeting mafic and ultramafic rocks formed 2.05 billion years ago in the Bushveld Igneous Complex of northeastern South Africa, which is the largest mafic–ultramafic layered intrusion on Earth [16,17]. The Bushveld Drilling Project of the ICDP is undertaking a 2.5-km-deep drill hole in the lower zone and base of the intrusion, where ultramafic rocks are expected to possess the chemical signature of the mantle endmember of mantle-crust mixing during magma emplacement [18,19]. Following comparatively rapid cooling of the magma chamber [20], the layered rocks have experienced minimal deformation and metamorphic alteration, based on general geological features such as the very minor occurrence of metamorphic rocks and the nearly horizontal dip [21]. Thus, the Bushveld Igneous Complex is considered to provide a stable habitat for microbial life for > 2 billion years. Additionally, the Bushveld Igneous Complex is hosted in the Kaapvaal Craton where the devoid of significant modern tectonic activity might help the long-term preservation of fluids and habitable environments [22,23, and references therein]. The long-term habitability of subsurface microbes has been studied in Precambrian cratons in Canada and South Africa where fluids and habitable environments have been preserved on a range of timescales from thousands to millions, to even billions of years [22,23, and references therein]. In the previous studies, fracture waters were obtained from deep underground tunnels constructed at mines. In this study, the habitability of 2.05-billion-year-old igneous rocks was investigated through drilling from the ground surface rather than underground sampling of fracture waters. Alternatively, rock sampling is feasible at surface outcrops. However, the freshness of rocks is concerned, given that the rocks have experienced weathering. This paper reports on the first subsurface rock sample obtained from the ICDP drilling used to test new approaches for the simultaneous visualization of microbial cells and fluorescent microspheres at fractures and veins. A new spectroscopic method was also applied to obtain diagnostic spectra from single microbial cells [24]. As a result, indigenous microbial cells locally distributed along clay-filled veins were detected. The Bushveld Igneous Complex is the largest mafic–ultramafic intrusion on Earth, with an areal extent of ~ 500 km in the east–west direction and 350 km north–south [21]. The magmas of the Bushveld Igneous Complex were emplaced in the early Proterozoic Pretoria Group of the Transvaal Supergroup 2.05 billion years ago [16]. The entire intrusion took place in a time span of 1 million years [19]. The Bushveld ICDP drilling site is located at Marula Mine in Burgersfort (− 24.50906°S, 30.08757°E), where the UG2 chromitite layer of the Upper Critical Zone is being exploited for the extraction of platinum group elements. Rotary core barrel (RCB) drilling was conducted by Master Drilling with a diamond drill bit and drilling fluid composed of locally sourced water mixed with a chemical additive (AMC CAP 21). Fluorescent microspheres called “Invisible Blue” (DayGlo Color Corp., pigment SPL-594NXC) with blue fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) excitation and a particle size range from 0.25 to 0.45 μm [25] were added to the drilling fluid. The original particle concentration of ∼1 × 1012particles/ml was diluted to a concentration of ~ 1 × 109particles/ml. A 30-cm-long core sample with a diameter of 85 mm at a depth of 15.28 (sample ID: 5067_3_A_010_2_WR:29-57) was obtained on May 4th, 2024. After the core retrieval, the sample was laid on aluminum foil in a core box for the initial photography. The core sample was washed with drinking water filtered through 0.2-µm-size pores (Fig.1). Although membrane vesicles and nanobacteria can pass through the filter, the cell densities measured after the passage through 0.1- and 0.2-µm-size pores were not different. The surface was lightly flamed with a gas torch on a flame-sterilized metal tray to reduce contamination, following a procedure used in the IODP expeditions [15,26]. After the cleaning steps, rock fractures were opened by hitting the core sample with a flame-sterilized hammer, and the rock fragments were stored at 4 °C in sterilized plastic bags, and then placed in vacuum-sealed plastic bags containing oxygen absorbent (Mitsubishi Chemicals Corp.). On-site handling of a drill core. A schematic illustration of the workflow for cleaning, flaming, and storing of a rock core sample The rock core fragments were illuminated by a 5-W UV light (Nichia Kagaku, Japan), and blue fluorescence was observed in a darkened room. After visual inspection, the rock fragment was cut using a precision diamond band saw operated without water (Meiwa Fosis Corp. DWS 3500P, Japan) in a clean booth flushed with HEPA-filtered air. A 3-mm-thick section was prepared by cutting the sample perpendicular to the fracture. Fluorescence microspheres that permeated from the fracture into the rock interior were observed by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus, Japan) with a CCD camera (Olympus DP71, Olympus, Japan) and the image processing software LuminaVision (Mitani Shoji Co., Ltd.). For the drilling fluid, a fluid sample was fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and then diluted with 10 ml filter-sterilized deionized water. After ultrasonic treatment for 30 s, a 0.2-µm-pore-size, 25-mm-diameter polycarbonate filter (Millipore) was used to collect dispersed particles. The filter was observed using the same fluorescence microscope system. The 3-mm-thick rock section was analyzed by optical-photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of 0.5 µm (mIRage infrared microscope, Photothermal Spectroscopy Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) using a continuous wave 532-nm laser as the probe beam. A pump beam consisting of a tunable quantum cascade laser (QCL) device (800–1800 cm−1; 2 cm−1spectral resolution; and 10 scans per spectrum) was also used. The refection mode (Cassegrain 40 objective (0.78 NA)) was used to obtain intensity maps at 1000, 1530, and 1640 cm−1as well as O-PTIR spectra over the mid-IR range. Co-cultured cells of Nanoarchaeota strain MJ1 andMetallosphaerasp. strain MJ1HA (JCM33617) and cultured cells ofShewanella oneidensis(ATCC 700550) were mounted on CaF2disks to obtain O-PTIR spectra. The Clay Science Society of Japan (JCSS) reference clay samples montmorillonite JCSS3101 ((M +0.97)[Si7.8Al.02][Al3.3Fe-0.2Mg.6]O20(OH)4)) and saponite JCSS3501 ((M +0.98)[Si7.2Al.08][Mg6.0]O20(OH)4)) and a reference sample of nontronite coded NAu-2 ((M +0.97)[Si7.57Al.01Fe.42][Al.52Fe3.32Mg.7]O20(OH)4[27] were also mounted on CaF2disks to obtain O-PTIR spectra. The drilling fluid sample was treated similarly to the rock to observe fluorescent microspheres, except for the incubation of the filter in a TAE buffer containing SYBR Green I for 5 min at room temperature. This step was followed by a brief rinsing with deionized water. After O-PTIR spectroscopic analysis, the 3-mm-thick section was fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight and stored at 4 °C in PBS. The fixed section was stained with SYBR Green I (Takara-Bio, Inc., Japan) for 30 min. After washing with ultrapure water, the section was observed using the same fluorescence microscopy system. The thin section was characterized by SEM without polishing. A field-emission-type SEM (FEI Versa 3D™) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) with a silicon drift detector (Bruker) was operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. This study sampled a drill core sample from ~ 15-m depth and a corresponding drilling fluid sample from the tank where fluorescent microspheres were added and mixed. Microscopic observations of fluorescent microspheres in the fluid sample confirmed that the concentration of fluorescent microspheres (1.1 × 109particles/ml) is consistent with dilution with water in the tank (Fig.2A). In the same drilling fluid sample, DNA-stained microbial cells with a size range from ~ 1 to ~ 5 µm were abundant (7.0 × 107cells/ml; Fig.2B). Thus, there is a concern that permeation of the drilling fluid into the interior of rock cores could cause microbial contamination. Microscopic inspection of the drill fluid sample.A1000-fold magnification images of fluorescent microspheres and (B) microbial cells stained by SYBR Green I The drill core sample consists of norite (mafic rock with dominant plagioclase and orthopyroxene) with a porphyritic texture (Fig.3A). After the mineral-filled fractures were opened (Fig.3B; a yellow arrow indicates the fracture shown in Fig.3C,E, andFand Fig.4A), a ~ 10-cm-long fragment was inspected for the occurrence of fluorescent microspheres by illuminating the core exterior and the fracture surface by UV light (Fig.3C–F). Strong blue signals from fluorescent microspheres were noticed from the core exterior (Fig.3D), whereas the blue signals were not evident at the entire fracture surface. These results demonstrate that the microspheres did not penetrate the mineral-filled fracture. Appearance of the studied drill core sample and visual inspection of drilling fluid contamination.

The intensity maps were obtained from the area highlighted with a yellow square inB.GRGB color synthesis of the three intensity maps. A yellow rectangle inGindicates an area where the intensity maps for RGB color synthesis are obtained in Fig. 5A To visualize the distribution of fluorescent microspheres from the fracture surface to the rock interior, a 3-mm-thick section was examined (Fig.4A; a yellow arrow indicates the fracture surface shown in Fig.3E andF). Microscopic observations revealed that fluorescent microspheres were not detected from the surface to the interior of the section (Fig.4B andC). These results also demonstrated that in addition to the rock surface, the rock interior was not contaminated by the drilling fluid. This new approach for contamination evaluation was successfully developed for the BVDP project. Before staining in SYBR Green I solution, which causes organic contamination, the detection of microbial cells was performed by a nondestructive technique called O-PTIR spectroscopy (Fig.4D–G). Three wave numbers were selected for intensity mapping, whereby 1000 cm−1and the combination of 1530 and 1640 cm−1indicate the presence of silicate minerals and microbial cells, respectively [28,29]. Mapping of a 2 × 2 mm area revealed veins nearly parallel to the fracture with high intensities at 1530 and 1640 cm−1(Fig.4E andF), whereas the ubiquity of silicate minerals was shown by the 1000 cm−1map (Fig.4D). From one of the vein-like regions (400 × 250 μm shown as a yellow rectangle in Fig.4G), RGB mapping was performed to resolve the intensity distributions of 1000, 1530, and 1640 cm−1(Fig. 5A). Although the 1640 cm−1intensity was strong throughout the vein region, the high intensity at 1530 cm−1appeared spotty and partly overlapped with the high intensity of 1000 cm−1(shown in white color in Fig. 5A). Mapping of white spots at the finer resolution showed a micrometer-scale heterogeneity (Fig. 5B). In Fig.4C, O-PTIR spectra obtained from the vein-like region represented by point 1 (Fig. 5B) had two major peaks attributed to SiO2(~ 1000 cm−1) and H2O (~ 1640 cm−1). The overall spectra are similar to those of smectite minerals commonly formed by low-temperature alteration of mafic and ultramafic rocks [14,30]. Several O-PTIR spectra from the white spots contained two peaks of ~ 1530 and ~ 1640 cm−1attributed to amides I and II, which are diagnostic for proteins in microbial cells (points 5 and 6 in Fig.5C). The rest of the peaks in the O-PTIR spectra are similar to those obtained from adjacent points (points 3 and 4) and a distant point (point 2), suggesting the coexistence of some mineral phases with microbial cells.

Fluorescent microscopic observations showed that greenish signals were obtained from the veins indicated by pink arrows in Fig.6A. High-magnification observations of the white spots revealed that the greenish signals were morphologically similar to microbial cells with a size range of less than 1 μm (Fig.6B). Taking the amide peaks in the O-PTIR spectra into account, we conclude that the veins are colonized by microbes. In addition, the morphological difference in microbial cells from the vein and the drilling fluid (Fig.2B) indicates that the microbial cells found in the vein are indigenous rather than originating from contamination.

The yellow rectangle inAis the same as shown in Fig. 5A, and the orange square inBis the same as in Fig. 5B. Pink arrows inApoint to the veins shown in Fig.4 After the DNA-stained microbial cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy, the section was analyzed by SEM–EDS to determine the vein-fill mineralogy (Fig.7). From a region associated with microbial cells in the vein (Fig.7A), Si, O, and Mg were detected as major elements (Fig.7B). A ratio of peak intensities of Si and Mg was ∼2:1, suggesting that the vein is filled with a 2:1 tri-octahedral clay mineral. The presence of water molecules in the O-PTIR spectrum (point 1 in Fig. 5C) and the low intensity of interlayer Ca in the EDS spectrum (Fig.7B) are consistent with the occurrence of saponite [14]. However, the co-occurrence of several clay minerals in the analyzed region was not excluded due to the spatial resolution of SEM–EDS analysis. Thus, high-resolution mineralogical analysis is needed to identify the mineral phases. Mineralogical characteristics of the vein associated with microbial colonization.AA back-scattered electron image of the area in the section, where microbial colonization is shown in Fig.6B.BAn EDS spectrum from the pink circle inA For microbiological investigations of igneous rocks in the subsurface, the use of fluorescent microspheres started in terrestrial drilling [31] and was later adopted for ocean drilling [32]. A common procedure for detecting fluorescent microspheres is to crush the rock core material into powder [26]. Fluorescent microspheres are extracted from the powdered material by suspending the sample in a 3% NaCl solution and collecting fluorescent microspheres from the supernatant. This procedure cannot distinguish the exact location of fluorescent microspheres or the proportion of microspheres in fractures/veins and in the rock matrix. The direct observation of fluorescent microspheres developed in this study enables the location-specific detection of fluorescent microspheres in fractures/veins. The new microbial detection approach also differs from previous approaches, in which rock fragments were embedded in hydrophilic resin to prepare thin sections [14,15]. Although the resin can preserve rock features found in the void space [33], fluorescent microspheres are removed during dehydration of the fragments with ethanol and subsequent resin embedding. Dry cutting with a diamond band saw has technical advantages in avoiding analytical interferences for organic compounds. In the previous approaches, staining of microbial cells with SYBR Green I was performed using a ~ 100-μm-thick section [14,15,33]. To verify the greenish signals of SYBR Green I–stained microbial cells or materials strongly adsorbing SYBR Green I [34], 3-μm-thick sections were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB). Subsequent nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) measurements were performed to show the co-localization of ions, such as32S−,31P−, and12C14N−[14,30]. The FIB section fabrication for NanoSIMS analysis was limited to very small areas (~ 10 × 10 μm), whereas mapping at the millimeter scale down to the tens of micrometer scale can be performed by O-PTIR spectroscopy. In ~ 100-Ma igneous rocks obtained from drill cores from the ICDP Oman ophiolite drilling and from IODP Expedition 329 to the South Pacific Gyre, microbial colonization was found to be associated with fractures and veins [12,14,15]. In the IODP basaltic basement study, the association of microbial cells and clay minerals was clearly demonstrated [14,15]. Clay minerals can effectively adsorb organic matter [35] and organic matter is also produced on clay minerals in situ [36]. Furthermore, it is known that H2is derived from H2O reacted with Fe(II) in the transformation of silicate minerals into clay minerals [37]. In the case of the 2-billion-year-old mafic rock investigated in this study, veins with microbial colonization are associated with clay minerals. The tight sealing of the veins with clay minerals prevented the contamination of microbial cells from the drilling fluid. In turn, indigenous microbes are immobile and survive in the veins by metabolizing inorganic and/or organic energy available around clay minerals. The age of vein formation and clay mineralization needs to be determined for the duration of habitability. Combining previously developed procedures using fluorescent microspheres and SYBR Green I for contamination control and microbial detection, respectively, this study successfully developed new procedures for the detection of microbial colonization in fractures/veins in drill cores of igneous rocks, involving precision sectioning by a diamond band saw and single-cell level detection by IR spectroscopy. Application of the new procedures to a 2-billion-year-old mafic rock from the Bushveld Igneous Complex revealed that indigenous microbes are colonizing veins filled with clay minerals. Future studies are directed to clarify the phylogenomic and metabolic profiles of the microbiome and the formation history of fractures/veins in the rock interior. No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study. Whitman WB, Coleman DC, Wiebe WJ (1998) Prokaryotes: the unseen majority.

The rock was excavated from the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, an area known for its rich ore deposits. This is the oldest example of living microbes being found within ancient rock so far discovered. The team involved in the study built on its previous work to perfect a technique involving three types of imaging – infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and fluorescent microscopy – to confirm that the microbes were indigenous to the ancient core sample and not caused by contamination during the retrieval and study process. Research on these microbes could help us better understand the very early evolution of life, as well as the search for extraterrestrial life in similarly aged rock samples brought back from Mars.
Deep in the earth lies something ancient and alive. Colonies of microbes live in rocks far beneath the surface, somehow managing to survive for thousands, even millions of years. These tiny, resilient organisms appear to live life at a slower pace, scarcely evolving over geological time spans and so offering us a chance to peek back in time. Now, researchers have found living microbes in a rock sample dated to be 2 billion years old.
“We didn’t know if 2-billion-year-old rocks were habitable. Until now, the oldest geological layer in which living microorganisms had been found was a 100-million-year-old deposit beneath the ocean floor, so this is a very exciting discovery. By studying the DNA and genomes of microbes like these, we may be able to understand the evolution of very early life on Earth,” said Yohey Suzuki, lead author and associate professor from the Graduate School of Science at the University of Tokyo.
The rock sample was taken from the Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC), a rocky intrusion in northeastern South Africa which formed when magma slowly cooled below the Earth’s surface. The BIC covers an area of approximately 66,000 square kilometers (roughly the size of Ireland), varies in thickness by up to 9 km, and contains some of the richest ore deposits on Earth including about 70% of the world’s mined platinum.
Due to the way it was formed and minimal deformation or change occurring to it since then, the BIC is believed to have provided a stable habitat for ancient microbial life to continue until today.
With the aid of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program, a nonprofit organization that funds exploration at geological sites, the team obtained a 30-centimeter-long rock core sample from about 15 meters belowground. The rock was cut into thin slices and analyzed, which is when the team discovered living microbial cells densely packed into cracks in the rock. Any gaps near these cracks were clogged with clay, making it impossible for the organisms to leave or for other things to enter.
The team built on a technique theyhad previously developedto confirm that the microbes were native to the rock sample, and not due to contamination during the drilling or examination process. By staining the DNA of the microbial cells and using infrared spectroscopy to look at the proteins in the microbes and surrounding clay, the researchers could confirm that the microorganisms were both alive and not contaminated.
“I am very interested in the existence of subsurface microbes not only on Earth, but also the potential to find them on other planets,” said Suzuki. “NASA’s Mars rover Perseverance is currently due to bring back rocks that are a similar age to those we used in this study. Finding microbial life in samples from Earth from 2 billion years ago and being able to accurately confirm their authenticity makes me excited for what we might be able to now find in samples from Mars.”

This is essential for the fundamental studies of physics as well as practical applications such as precision spectroscopy4,5,6,7, ultracold gases with quantum statistical properties8,9,10and quantum computing. In laser cooling, atoms are slowed to otherwise unattainable velocities through repeated cycles of laser photon absorption and spontaneous emission in random directions. Simple systems can serve as rigorous testing grounds for fundamental physics—one such case is the purely leptonic positronium11,12, an exotic atom comprising an electron and its antiparticle, the positron. Laser cooling of positronium, however, has hitherto remained unrealized. Here we demonstrate the one-dimensional laser cooling of positronium. An innovative laser system emitting a train of broadband pulses with successively increasing central frequencies was used to overcome major challenges posed by the short positronium lifetime and the effects of Doppler broadening and recoil. One-dimensional chirp cooling was used to cool a portion of the dilute positronium gas to a velocity distribution of approximately 1 K in 100 ns. A major advancement in the field of low-temperature fundamental physics of antimatter, this study on a purely leptonic system complements work on antihydrogen13, a hadron-containing exotic atom. The successful application of laser cooling to positronium affords unique opportunities to rigorously test bound-state quantum electrodynamics and to potentially realize Bose–Einstein condensation14,15,16,17,18in this matter–antimatter system. The cooling of positronium (Ps) has profound implications for fundamental physics. As the simplest atomic system, consisting of a bound state of two leptons, Ps can serve as a rigorous testing ground for quantum electrodynamics19, one of the most precisely verified theories of modern physics. An example is the measurement of the 1S–2Stransition frequency20,21,22, in which a reduction in the present fractional uncertainty of 2.6 × 10−9is required for a stringent comparison with quantum electrodynamics calculations accurate to 4.7 × 10−10(refs.23,24,25). Reducing systematic errors using cold Ps gas and an optical frequency comb is essential. Moreover, cold Ps atoms can provide a unique experimental platform to search for charge–parity–time reversal (CPT) symmetry breaking in the lepton sector, and investigating the effects of gravity on antimatter26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. Owing to its light mass (twice that of an electron), Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) is expected to occur at relatively high temperatures, ranging from a few kelvin to several tens of kelvin14,15,16,17,18, compared with ordinary atoms. Discussions regarding the generation of coherent γ-rays using Ps BECs have been noted34,35. Furthermore, cold Ps can be used for efficient antihydrogen generation36. The cooling of Ps is a requisite for such investigations. Despite these high expectations, there has been no demonstration of laser cooling of Ps. The concept of laser cooling of Ps using the 1S–2Ptransition with a natural linewidth of 50 MHz was first explored some 30 years ago37, with some preliminary implementation studies38,39thereafter. Laser cooling with a wide spectral width and long laser duration in a high magnetic field has recently been investigated theoretically40. Laser cooling is an established technique applied to atoms and molecules, based on photon recoil and the Doppler effect. The fundamental mechanism is the reduction in the translational momentum of a moving particle resulting from the absorption of a red-detuned laser photon that propagates counter to the motion and the subsequent emission of a photon in a random direction. Cooling is achieved through repeated cycles of this absorption–emission process. Examples of current laser cooling techniques include Doppler cooling, chirp cooling and magneto-optical traps. Two key characteristics of Ps make its laser cooling challenging—its brief lifetime and the large recoil-induced frequency shift. The triplet 1Sstate of Ps has a lifetime of 142 ns due to pair annihilation into γ-rays, thereby requiring rapid cooling. Furthermore, as Ps is nearly three orders of magnitude lighter than a hydrogen atom, the velocity change associated with the absorption and emission of photons is concomitantly large. The recoil velocityvrdue to a 243-nm-wavelength photon, which induces the 1S–2Ptransition, is approximatelyvr= 1.5 × 103m s–1(equivalent to 55 mK). The large recoil velocity enables rapid deceleration. However, the corresponding change in resonance frequency due to the Doppler effect is 6.2 GHz, which is considerably larger than the natural linewidth of 50 MHz. Therefore, laser cooling halts after one cooling cycle if we use a narrow-bandwidth cooling laser, as commonly used in the Doppler cooling of ordinary atoms. Moreover, the recoil limit temperature is higher than the Doppler limit temperature, in contrast to ordinary atoms and molecules. The Doppler broadening of the 1S–2Ptransition at 300 K extends to approximately 460 GHz at the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). In principle, the cooling of Ps is possible by using a laser pulse with a linewidth of the order of 100 GHz and a long duration, but the resulting temperature is limited to a few tens of kelvin40. Here, to overcome these challenges, we have extended the chirp cooling technique41,42commonly used to decelerate atomic beams. In chirp cooling, the frequency of the laser light changes over time to follow the change in the shifted resonance frequency due to deceleration, maintaining the cooling cycle. If the laser used has a very fast frequency chirp, which adapts to the large recoil-induced shift, substantial Doppler broadening and short lifetime, Ps can be cooled down to the recoil-limited velocity distribution, equivalent to sub-kelvin levels41. We used a previously demonstrated laser43,44that has the potential to realize such cooling. From this tailored laser, which is based on an injection-locked pulsed laser incorporating an electro-optic modulator in the laser cavity, short optical pulses of approximately 0.1 ns duration were successively output every 4.2 ns (Fig.1aand Methods). Each pulse was spectrally continuous with a bandwidth of 8.9 GHz at FWHM, simultaneously covering all 1S–2Ptransition frequencies, triply split over 9.87 GHz. Thus, the pulse served for both cooling and repumping. The repumping prevents the reduction in cooling efficiency due to spin polarization of the 1Sstate during cooling (Methods). The central frequency of the pulse increases with each pulse, and the chirp is linear with a rate of 4.9 × 102GHz μs–1. The duration of the pulse train was adjustable up to approximately 1 μs. This chirped train of optical pulses is denoted here as the cooling laser. By effecting progressive deceleration from fast to slow Ps with chirp cooling in a counter-propagating configuration, we expect to obtain a velocity distribution close to the recoil-limited one. This laser cooling method is anticipated to produce slow Ps atoms in both electrostatic- and magnetostatic-field-free environments, marking an essential advancement in precision spectroscopy. a, Interactions between the laser pulses and Ps. Relevant energy levels are shown up to the total angular momentum. The cooling pulses simultaneously address all the 2Psublevels, followed by relaxation to the 1Slevel by spontaneous emission. In the Doppler profile measurements, we simultaneously excite all the 2Psublevels with the probe pulse. Following excitation, an ionization laser pulse at 532 nm produces photoionized electrons and positrons from the excited Ps atoms in the 2Pstate. The frequencies shown in the figure correspond to the difference in eigenenergies23. The table shows the decay rate for each state.Γann.andΓsp.are the decay rates for the annihilation and spontaneous emission, respectively. Inset in dashed lines, the spectrum of the constituent pulses of the cooling laser changes with time.b, Top view of the experimental setup in the vacuum chamber. The inset shows a bird’s eye view of the setup.c, Timing chart illustrating the sequence of positron injection, laser cooling of Ps and detection of photoionized positrons. The experimental configuration inside the vacuum chamber is shown in Fig.1b. Here we depict the pulsed generation of Ps gas in vacuum, three spatially superimposed laser beams and the acquisition of excitation signals for the 1S–2Ptransitions. The experiment was conducted at the Slow Positron Facility of the Institute of Materials Structure Science, the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Japan. Bunches of 104positrons (16 ns duration, 50 Hz repetition rate)45were guided through a magnetic field, focused by a magnetic lens and injected at room temperature into a sample of silica aerogel, which was used as the Ps formation medium46. Here γ-ray detection using scintillators facilitated the measurement of the arrival time of the positron bunch (Methods). Approximately 3 × 103Ps atoms per positron bunch were released from the silica aerogel into the vacuum on the positron-injection side. Throughout this study, we evaluated the velocity distribution at 125 ns after production. At this point, we estimated that the Ps gas had a spatial spread of nearly 10 mm in the longitudinal and transverse directions, resulting in a density of approximately 103cm−3. The three collimated laser beams encompassed the entirety of the Ps spatial spread. The laser beams consisted of the cooling laser at 243 nm, a nanosecond laser pulse at 243 nm and a nanosecond laser pulse at 532 nm. We evaluated the velocity distribution of Ps by Doppler spectroscopy using the 1S–2Ptransition. Here we refer to the nanosecond laser pulse at 243 nm for Doppler spectroscopy as the probe pulse. The Ps atoms excited to the 2Pstate by the probe pulse were photoionized by the 532 nm pulse before relaxation to the 1Sstate. Photoionized positrons produced were collected by a microchannel plate (MCP) that was driven in a pulsed manner following the end of all the laser pulses, and the output current was converted to a voltage signal. This positron detection method offers high efficiency, enabling measurements to be conducted within a few days of the experimental beam time. Furthermore, the environment was electrostatic-field free until the interaction between Ps and laser pulses was complete. Figure1cshows the timing chart from positron injection for Ps generation to the acquisition of the voltage signal from the MCP. The maximum magnitude of the residual static magnetic flux density was 0.15 mT over the entire experimental setup, indicating that its influence on Ps lifetime was negligible. In the following, the uncertainty of the signal level is dominated by the statistical Poisson uncertainty associated with the detected number of photoionized positrons. Before proceeding with the laser cooling experiment, we examined the Ps gas temperature at 125 ns after the production of Ps from the Doppler profile (Fig.2a). The measurement time for each frequency was approximately 20 min (equivalent to 1.2 × 104measurement cycles; Methods). The profile has a spread around the theoretically known frequency difference between the 13S1and 23P2levels (1,233,599 GHz), reflecting the velocity distribution of Ps atoms in the 1Sstate. The gas temperature was estimated by assuming the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Fitting the data with a model (Methods) that accounts for the 110 GHz spectral width of the multimode probe pulse and Lamb dip associated with the counter-propagating laser beam revealed the gas temperature as 6.1(5) × 102K (the source of the uncertainty is statistical). In aerogels with mean free paths of tens of nanometres46, thermalization is relatively slow. If the Ps species generated by low-energy positrons are emitted into vacuum before fully thermalizing, this could account for the temperature difference between the aerogel and the Ps gas. a, Doppler profile of Ps.Soffis the 1S–2Pexcitation signal without cooling. The horizontal axis is the relative optical frequency of the probe pulse inducing the 1S–2Ptransition, which is evaluated with respect to the frequency difference between the 13S1and 23P2levels of 1,233,599 GHz. The error bars originate from statistical uncertainty in the number of ionized positrons. The dotted curve is a fit based on the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The shaded area indicates the range of optical frequencies for which we performed laser cooling and detected changes in the Doppler profile.b, Fractional change in the Doppler profile of Ps as a result of laser cooling. We evaluated the fractional change by comparing the 1S–2Pexcitation signals with (Son) and without (Soff) cooling laser irradiation. The filled circles represent the results when the optical frequencies of the cooling laser were set to a detuning suitable for cooling (swept from −59 to −9 GHz). The open circles represent the results of a control experiment with a larger detuning of the cooling laser (swept from −209 to −159 GHz). The dotted curve is a theoretical fitting to the data based on a phenomenological model (Methods). The spectral width of the probe pulse used for fit was 16 GHz. The dashed line is a constant function fitted to the data in a control experiment. In both cooling and control experiments, spectrally narrowed probe pulses were used. To demonstrate laser cooling, we irradiated the Ps gas with the cooling laser for 100 ns to maximize the number of atoms around zero velocity (Methods), commencing at the peak time of the positron pulse injection. The range of the Doppler shift of Ps affected by the cooling laser was approximately ±60 GHz with respect to the central frequency. Although it is possible to target the entire Doppler profile by extending the duration of the cooling laser, this is expected to yield fewer zero-velocity components (Methods). We measured the Doppler profile with an improved frequency resolution in the range mentioned above (Fig.2a, shaded area) to best investigate the changes in the components interacting with the cooling laser. We obtained an optical frequency resolution ranging from 8 to 16 GHz by narrowing the 110 GHz linewidth of the original probe pulse using a Fabry–Pérot etalon (Methods). In the following, the measurement time for each frequency was 4 h, which is equivalent to 7.2 × 104measurement cycles (Methods). Figure2bshows the fractional changes in the Doppler distribution. The excitation signal of the 1S–2Ptransition after irradiation with the cooling laser is defined asSonand the fractional change as (Son−Soff)/Soff. The filled circles show the results obtained when we tuned the optical frequency of the cooling laser to the conditions expected to produce a high cooling efficiency. The optical frequency (detuning) of the cooling laser was adjusted to chirp from approximately 1,233,540 GHz (−59 GHz) to 1,233,590 GHz (−9 GHz) during the 100 ns period. The data show a decrease in the number of Ps in the optical frequency range swept by the cooling laser, accompanied by an approximately threefold increase in the number of Ps near zero velocity within a narrow velocity range, demonstrating the laser cooling of Ps—this result is the anticipated breakthrough achieved using our laser cooling technique. Such an increase in the slow component is essential for reducing systematic and statistical errors in the precision spectroscopy of short-lifetime systems. We quantitatively evaluated the change in the Doppler profile resulting from laser cooling using a phenomenological model (Methods) to fit the measured data, taking into account the frequency resolution. The resultant fit is shown as the dotted curve in Fig.2b. The best-fit value and the upper limit of the FWHM of the decelerated component were 23 and 30 GHz, respectively, which were evaluated by adopting the best resolution of 8 GHz. The corresponding temperatures were 0.8 and 1.4 K, indicating the cooling of velocities equivalent to approximately 1 K. In the frequency range swept by the cooling laser, reductions in the population of the 1Sstate were assessed to be 61% and 49%, respectively. Although the unknown number of delayed Ps released from the silica aerogel (Methods) precludes further quantitative discussion, most of the Ps resonating with the cooling laser were efficiently decelerated, as supported by the subsequent simulation (approximately 70% reduction in the swept frequency region, resulting in approximately 10% of the entire Ps population constituting the cooled component, assuming no delayed Ps release). These results, combined with the threefold enhancement of components near zero velocity, attest to the superior performance of our laser cooling technique. Considering that the unfixed frequency resolution varies between 8 and 16 GHz due to experiment-specific reasons (Methods), the aforementioned cooling performance, determined assuming the best frequency resolution, is probably an underestimate, as suggested by the numerical simulations presented below. A control experiment was also performed in which the cooling laser was largely detuned. We tuned the optical frequency (detuning) to change from approximately 1,233,390 GHz (−209 GHz) to 1,233,440 GHz (−159 GHz) in 100 ns. In this case, Ps in the probed velocity range did not resonate with the cooling laser and no fractional change was expected. The open circles in Fig.2brepresent the fractional changes observed. The dashed line is a constant function fitted to the experimental results, indicating that there was no statistically significant change. Thus, the cooling laser does not impart a velocity change to the Ps that are off-resonant with it. In Doppler spectroscopy, velocity distribution assessment is influenced by frequency resolution and 2Plevel splitting. To examine the presumed velocity distribution indicated in the experimental results, we conducted numerical simulations. We developed a framework to calculate the time evolution of the density matrix based on the Lindblad master equation (Methods). For the time–frequency characteristics and intensity of the cooling laser pulse train, we used parameters that were consistent with our experiments. Moreover, we did not include interatomic interactions and delayed Ps release from the aerogel. Figure3ashows how the velocity distribution of Ps in the 1Sstate changed over time with the cooling laser over a duration of 100 ns. The chirp rate of 4.9 × 102GHz μs–1corresponds to a velocity change of 120 m s–1in 1 ns for Ps that resonate with the cooling laser. The single-pulse linewidth of 8.9 GHz (FWHM) corresponds to a velocity range of Δvsingle= 2,200 m s–1(FWHM) that is covered. a, Velocity distribution of Ps. We set the duration of the cooling pulse train to 100 ns, as in the experiment. The one-dimensional velocity distributions of 1SPs expected at 0, 42, 89 and 127 ns after the beginning of the cooling pulse train are shown. The probability density at each velocity was plotted relative to that at 0 ns. The recoil velocityvrand velocity width Δvsingle(in resonance with the FWHM frequency width of a single pulse in the cooling laser) are also shown.b, Reconstructed fractional change in Doppler profile at 125 ns. The curve shows the simulated results. The thickness originates from the frequency resolution and uncertainty in the uncooled fraction. The filled circles are obtained from Fig.2b. The result at 42 ns (corresponding to a resonance velocity change of approximately 5,000 m s–1) shows that Ps atoms with higher velocities are sequentially decelerated without velocity intermittency and accumulate on the slower side. This corroborates the high deceleration efficiency of our cooling pulse train. At 89 ns (corresponding to a resonance velocity change of approximately 11,000 m s–1), the decelerated Ps atoms were concentrated near zero velocity. The FWHM of the velocity distribution was approximately 3vr, and the corresponding temperature was 0.48 K. At 127 ns, that is, 27 ns after the end of the cooling sequence, most of the excited Ps atoms had relaxed to the 1Sstate. Considering the frequency resolution and the possible delayed Ps release inferred from the fitting above, the simulated distribution quantitatively reproduced (Fig.3b) the fractional change in the Doppler profile (Fig.2b). In the velocity region where there was no interaction with the cooling laser, for example, near a velocity of 18,000 m s–1, the number of Ps decayed by a factor of approximately 1/2.4 at 127 ns due to self-annihilation. However, the number of Ps near zero velocity increased by a factor of three or more compared with that at 0 ns. Note that discrete peak structures were observed in the final velocity distribution. In addition to a distribution that shows an FWHM of approximatelyvr(equivalent to 55 mK) spread around the zero velocity, peaks that are shifted byvrfrom the zero-velocity component appeared. Although further study is needed, these structures indicate a sub-recoil cooling capability, similar to the dark states in Doppler cooling47,48. State-selective cooling in the final stage will be beneficial for the realization of a sub-100-mK Ps gas, eliminating the shifted peaks and transitions that induce residual acceleration. We have successfully demonstrated the one-dimensional chirp cooling of Ps approaching the recoil limit. This innovative chirped cooling method can efficiently cool Ps to a hitherto unexplored narrow velocity range near zero, thereby providing scientific opportunities for this low-temperature, fundamental matter–antimatter bound system. Increased positron number and longer beam time will enable the verification of the sub-Doppler, narrow components indicated by simulations. Several strategies can be used to cool the entire Doppler distribution, such as extended cooling time with the presented chirp rate. The reduction in the number of cooled atoms indicated by our simulations (Methods) will be offset by increasing the slow positron beam intensity. The next natural extension is three-dimensional cooling (see Methods for the Doppler profile in the direction away from the surface of the aerogel; the current configuration did not provide cooling in this dimension), which reduces the second-order Doppler shift of the 1S–2Stransition frequency by more than three orders of magnitude. Despite the two-component velocity distribution, the light mass of Ps aids the spatial separation of the cooled component with time allowing for selective excitation. However, there is a concern that three-dimensional cooling can result in higher temperatures or lower decelerated populations than those reported here because the number of cooling cycles is limited by the annihilation lifetime. One solution is to use the conventional cooling method of thermal contact with low-temperature materials18,49as a precooling method. Enhancing the cooling rate by adopting stimulated emission, as used in atomic and molecular cooling50,51, could also be beneficial. We believe that this more efficient three-dimensional cooling will enable the deceleration of most Doppler-broadened Ps atoms before annihilation, and is important for the realization of BEC in this particle–antiparticle system. The actual required density should be fully investigated because of the lower elastic scattering rates52between Ps at lower temperatures, which can markedly influence the thermalization for inherently short-lifetime systems. When achieved, comparisons with the BECs of excitons in semiconductors53, another exotic atom system with a finite lifetime, will have important implications in quantum statistical physics. A recent publication54submitted on the same date reports the one-dimensional cooling of Ps using the same transition as the present study. This experiment used the irradiation of a broadband, high-intensity cooling laser with a linewidth of approximately 100 GHz (r.m.s.) for a duration of 70 ns. This induced transitions in a broader velocity range of Ps than that in the present study, resulting in cooling from 380(20) to 170(20) K. In our research, we achieved the cooling of Ps over a velocity range equivalent to approximately 50 GHz by irradiating with a chirped train of pulses, each having a linewidth of 8.9 GHz, for 100 ns. Consequently, the Doppler broadening of the cooled components near zero velocity corresponds to approximately 1 K. When a positron pulse is injected into certain media, some positrons form Ps and re-emit as Ps into vacuum. These Ps were used in this laser cooling experiment. Positron pulses, with a width of 16 ns and delivered at a repetition rate of 50 Hz (ref.45), contained approximately 106positrons per pulse. The positrons were transported with an energy of 5 keV from the positron production unit to the experimental station guided by a typical magnetic field of approximately 10 mT generated by coils. By conducting current in the opposite direction only in the last coil, immediately before the experimental station, we minimized the magnetic field in the experimental region. Iron plates for magnetic shielding and the magnetic lens located downstream contributed to this minimization, further reducing the magnetic field in the experimental region to approximately 0.15 mT. This suppresses the Zeeman effect, resulting in a negligible annihilation rate of Ps in the 13S1state (ortho-Ps) due to spin mixing. The transported positrons were focused onto the Ps formation medium using a magnetic lens. Approximately 1% of the incident positrons passed through the magnetic lens, and the remainder collided with the lens and annihilated. The instability in the number of positrons remained at approximately 1% throughout the experiment. We used a silica aerogel, a three-dimensional network of SiO2(silica) nanograins, as the medium for the formation of Ps at room temperature. The silica aerogel had pores with a diameter of 45 nm and a porosity of approximately 95%. The incident angle of the positron bunch on the aerogel was 0° and approximately half the positrons injected into the silica aerogel formed Ps46. Some of the long-livedortho-Ps atoms diffused and came out of the aerogel towards the experimental region.Ortho-Ps atoms decay into γ-rays with a vacuum lifetime of approximately 142 ns and these γ-rays were detected using a LaBr3(Ce) scintillator and a plastic scintillator. The time-resolved γ-ray flux was measured by observing the current output of the coupled photomultiplier tubes. No influence was detected on the Ps from possible electrostatic charging of the silica aerogel. A pulsed laser at 729 nm, which constitutes the backbone of the cooling laser, is called a chirped pulse-train generator43. This is an injection-locked pulsed laser equipped with an intracavity electro-optic phase modulator. It generates a train of approximately 0.1 ns pulses, each with progressively shifting central frequencies. These pulses are then amplified and frequency tripled, producing the 243 nm cooling laser light. The change in the central frequency over time (chirp) can be adjusted by changing the cavity length of the pulsed laser, the driving frequency and the modulation depth of the electro-optic modulator. The duration of the pulse train (the number of micropulses) can also be controlled up to approximately 600 ns, corresponding to a frequency sweep range of approximately 300 GHz using the chirp rate of the present study. Details on the operating principle of the chirped pulse-train generator can be found in ref.43, and specifics regarding the design and performance evaluation of the cooling laser in this experiment are described in ref.44. Although the pulse duration has not yet been precisely measured, based on our measurements with an insufficient temporal resolution and the operating principle of the laser, a 0.1 ns pulse duration is estimated. Although an estimate (rather than a precise measurement), it does not affect the discussions in this paper as it is on a timescale considerably shorter than the natural lifetime of the 2Pstate. Ps atoms emitted into vacuum were irradiated by three different pulsed lasers for chirp cooling in the one-dimensional direction as well as measuring the velocity distribution. The laser beams were incident in a direction orthogonal to the positron beam axis and reflected by a bare aluminium mirror in a counter-propagating configuration. The wavelengths of the light pulses used were 243 and 532 nm, with approximately 93% reflectance off the mirror at these wavelengths. The laser irradiation area was approximately 18 mm in the direction of the positron beam axis and approximately 8 mm in the vertical direction perpendicular to the positron beam axis. The Ps-cooling chirped pulse-train laser was switched on for approximately 100 ns after the positron pulse impacted the silica aerogel. The fluence of a single pulse in an irradiating pulse train was typically 5 μJ cm–2. During the irradiation period (approximately 100 ns), the central frequency of the light pulse was varied from 1,233,540 to 1,233,590 GHz, with a spectral width for a single pulse of 8.9 GHz (FWHM). The cooling laser was linearly polarized with a polarization direction orthogonal to the positron beam direction. The velocity distribution of theortho-Ps in the 1Sstate was evaluated by Doppler spectroscopy using the 1S–2Ptransition. The Doppler profile of the 1Sstate was obtained by measuring the signal associated with the number of positrons produced by ionizing the Ps in the 2Pstate as a function of the probe pulse frequency that resonantly induces the 1S–2Ptransition. The Doppler shift is indicative of the velocity of Ps along the propagation direction of the laser beam, allowing the evaluation of theortho-Ps velocity distribution based on the measured Doppler profile. This measurement was conducted approximately 25 ns after the laser cooling ceased, after the complete de-excitation of the 23PJ-state Ps through spontaneous emission. Doppler spectroscopy was carried out at a 10 Hz repetition rate, and the laser cooling occurred at a 5 Hz rate. By comparing the Doppler profiles before and after laser cooling, changes in the velocity distribution due to cooling can be assessed. The second harmonic of an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) excited by the third harmonic of aQ-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used as the probe laser for Doppler spectroscopy. The pulse duration was approximately 3 ns. The optical frequency of the probe laser was swept at approximately 1.2336 PHz and was measured using a wavelength meter with an accuracy of ±3 pm (corresponding to a frequency accuracy of approximately 15 GHz). Because of the longitudinal multimode nature, the spectral width of the second harmonic of the OPO was approximately 1.1 × 102GHz. This spectral width was too wide to capture the changes in velocity profile resulting from chirp cooling. Therefore, the second harmonic of the OPO was transmitted through a solid etalon to narrow the spectrum and improve the velocity resolution. The measured transmission spectral width of our custom-made solid etalon available at 243 nm varied from 8 to 16 GHz at FWHM, depending on the angle and position of incidence. However, the Doppler broadening of Ps without cooling has an FWHM of approximately\(27\sqrt{T}\)GHz at a temperature ofTK. This corresponds to a frequency width of 470 GHz at room temperature, which is considerably wider than the narrow resolution. To measure the Doppler profile under uncooled conditions and evaluate the temperature, it was unnecessary to spectrally narrow the second harmonic of the OPO. A greater fraction of Ps with a distributed velocity was resonant, resulting in a larger signal. Therefore, we did not use the solid etalon when measuring the Doppler profile under uncooled conditions. The typical incident fluences of the laser pulse that induced the 1S–2Ptransition were 0.27 and 2 μJ cm–2with and without spectral narrowing, respectively. This resulted in comparable light spectral densities for these two cases. The polarization of the laser pulse that induced the 1S–2Ptransition was linear and parallel to the positron beam. For the ionization laser to photoionize Ps in the 23PJstate, we used the second harmonic (532 nm) of aQ-switched Nd:YAG laser with a pulse duration of 5 ns. This ionizing laser pulse was delivered with the timing of the intensity peak adjusted to approximately 1.4 ns later than that of the ultraviolet nanosecond pulse, which induced the 1S–2Ptransition. The irradiation fluence of the 532 nm pulse was typically 15 mJ cm–2. We set the ionization laser to be linearly polarized parallel to the positron beam, similar to the laser that induced the 1S–2Ptransition. The repetition rate of the ionizing laser was 10 Hz, same as that of the laser inducing the 1S–2Ptransition. Ionized positrons, produced with velocity selectivity from the Ps gas by the two-colour pulsed lasers, were drawn into an MCP. The MCP was placed immediately below the interaction region where Ps and the laser beams interacted. We applied a voltage of −2,000 V to the input surface of the MCP to collect the ionized positrons. The MCP was sensitive to the scattered photons of the deep-ultraviolet laser pulses at a wavelength of 243 nm, which resulted in a large background signal. Therefore, a pulsed negative voltage was applied to the MCP input surface after the completion of cooling laser irradiation, with a rise time of approximately 20 ns. Consequently, the MCP gain remained low at the time when the cooling and probe lasers were incident. This reduces the background signal originating from these photons, enabling the highly sensitive detection of ionized positrons. The voltage at the output plane of the MCP was set to 0 V. The amplified electrons were collected at a metal electrode, to which a constant voltage of 1,000 V was applied. The current output from this electrode was converted to a voltage with a 50 Ω resistor, and its time evolution was recorded. Positron signals were observed in the range of approximately 30–80 ns after the pulse voltage was applied, corresponding to the drift time that is dependent on the Ps location at photoionization. Although the background signal originating from the deep-ultraviolet photons was substantially reduced, a residual signal remained. To subtract this contribution, the ionizing laser was switched on and off every 30 s and we evaluated the signal of ionized positrons based on the difference in the integrated signals of the MCP with and without the ionizing laser. When the number of Ps in the whole velocity distribution was approximately 3 × 103immediately after production, the average number of detected positrons in the frequency-resolved measurements was typically 0.5. Consequently, the uncertainty in the excitation signal in the Doppler spectroscopy measurements was characterized by the randomness in the number of ionized positrons, which is governed by Poisson statistics. To achieve an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, it was necessary to set an appropriate measurement time. For the Doppler spectroscopy used to assess the temperature of Ps gas with a frequency resolution of 110 GHz, the integration time for each probe frequency was approximately 20 min. During this integration time, the number of measurement cycles was approximately 1.2 × 104. In the laser cooling experiment, for which the resolution was set to be an order of magnitude greater and thus the signal was weaker, the integration time was approximately 4 h for each probe frequency. During this time, the number of measurement cycles was approximately 7.2 × 104. We estimated the temperature of the Ps emitted from the silica aerogel using the measured Doppler profile. For this purpose, we defined a model function, which was fitted to the data. The model function describes the number of positronsS(ωR) generated by the photoionization process from the 2Pstate as a function of the central angular frequencyωRof the probe pulse that induces the 1S–2Ptransition.S(ωR) is written as whereD(v;T) is the probability density of Ps with velocityvand temperatureT(the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution function is used);ISis the saturation intensity at the 1S–2Ptransition angular frequencyωeg;I(v;ωR) is the light intensity at the angular frequency resonant to a Ps atom with velocityv; andCis a constant and free parameter in the fitting. The second term in the integral represents the photoionization probability of Ps at velocityv. The functional form forS(ωR) was determined using the following relation55: which describes the occupation probability of the excited state in a two-level system when irradiated with light of the transition frequency at intensityIR(see the denominator in the fraction). We used a two-level approximation because we set the spectral width of the probe pulse to be sufficiently wide compared with the splitting in the 1S–2Ptransition frequency.S(ωR), determined usingPe, describes the nonlinear responses to the probe laser pulse, such as the Lamb dip and saturation broadening effects in the present Doppler-broadened case. In our experiment, we directed each laser beam at the Ps in a counter-propagating configuration. Therefore, whereIL(ω;ωR) is the intensity spectrum, described as a function ofω, of the probe pulse with its central angular frequencyωR, andcis the speed of light. We adopted the measured spectral width ofIL(ω;ωR), with the intensity being a free parameter in the fitting. Here we did not include the spatial distributions of light intensity and Ps density. The light intensity of the probe pulse that reproduced the measurement was consistent with the actual light intensity calculated using the fluence, pulse duration and spectral width. This result demonstrates the validity of the proposed model. The Doppler profile in the direction normal to the surface of the silica aerogel (Extended Data Fig.1) was measured by the single-path irradiation of the probe pulse and ionization pulse. These optical pulses (diameter, approximately 10 mm) propagated towards the aerogel 125 ns after the peak timing of the positron bunch. The angles of incidence on the aerogel were 0° for the probe beam and 22° for the positron bunch. The peak of the Doppler profile was observed at a relative frequency of approximately −360 GHz, with an FWHM of approximately 390 GHz. In contrast to the velocity components parallel to the aerogel surface, which are randomly distributed, the distribution of the velocity components perpendicular to the surface cannot be effectively described by a simple distribution function that represents gases or beams. The velocity of Ps moving away from the surface depends not only on its velocity in the generating material but also on its work function. Consequently, the velocity distribution can generally differ from the component parallel to the surface. For these reasons, we did not perform an evaluation by fitting the experimental data. Irrespective of the parallel or perpendicular direction to the surface, the emission velocity of Ps changes dynamically with the reduction in momentum due to scattering with the molecules comprising the aerogel, with the velocity distribution also being influenced by the decay due to the Ps lifetime. We analysed the fractional change in the velocity distribution induced by the cooling laser by fitting the following phenomenological model to the data: the fractional change forSon(f) andSoff(f) is defined as We first used the following raw functions that did not include the frequency resolution in the experiment: where the argumentfis the relative frequency,f0is the 13S1–23P2transition frequency of Ps,mPsis the mass of Ps,kBis the Boltzmann constant andT0is the temperature of Ps released from the silica aerogel. On the basis of the experimental results, we assumed that the Doppler profile of the uncooled Ps was a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at temperatureT0= 600 K. The following free parameters used in the fit describe the change in Doppler profile associated with cooling:fcooledis the Doppler shift corresponding to the optical frequency at the beginning of the cooling laser; Δfis the Doppler width of the decelerated component;Scooledis the signal level after cooling in the spectral region swept by the chirped cooling laser;Acharacterizes the magnitude of the decelerated component signal. These raw functions are plotted in Extended Data Fig.2. We generated model functionsSon(f) andSoff(f), which correspond to the experimental results obtained, by convolving\({S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{raw}}(f)\)and\({S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{raw}}(f)\)with the frequency resolution due to the linewidth of the probe pulse. The change in Doppler profile associated with cooling was quantitatively evaluated by fitting the modelled fractional change to the measured fractional changes. In Extended Data Fig.2,\({S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{raw}}(f)\)is plotted using the parameters obtained from the fit. The fitting parameters varied with the spectral width of the probe pulse, which determined the frequency resolution of the measured Doppler profile. When the spectral width, which varied in the experiment, was set to 8 GHz (narrowest), the widest Doppler spread of the cooling component was evaluated. In the main text, we have shown the corresponding best-fit value (23 GHz) and upper statistical limit (30 GHz) as conservative estimates (the upper statistical limit of the width of the cooled component was evaluated at the 95% confidence level). The population reductions in the cooled spectral region were estimated to be 61% and 49%, respectively. For a spectral width of 16 GHz for the probe pulse, the best-fit value and the upper limit of the width of the cooled component were 18 and 27 GHz, and the corresponding population reductions were 78% and 61%, respectively. We believe that the estimated population reductions were smaller than those expected from population reduction by laser cooling alone, due to the influence of delayed Ps release from the silica aerogel. Such delayed release from porous materials has been reported previously56. Our empirical observations suggest the presence of Ps emitted from the silica aerogel several tens of nanoseconds after the injection of the positron bunch, when we observed the components of zero lateral velocity. However, we cannot quantitatively discuss the delayed fraction due to the absence of available systematic data. The frequency resolution of the fractional change in the Doppler profile as a result of laser cooling was determined using the spectral width of the probe pulse and intensity-dependent saturation broadening. We evaluated the spectral width of the probe pulse using the optical resolution of the Fabry–Pérot solid etalon used for spectral narrowing. The FWHM optical frequency resolution as a function of the angle of incidence is shown in Extended Data Fig.3. The resolution was evaluated by measuring the transmission spectrum of single-longitudinal-mode laser pulses at 243 nm. The spectral width of the pulses is expected to be less than 10 MHz, which is considerably narrower than the designed frequency resolution of the solid etalon, thereby enabling the evaluation of the actual resolution. We measured the transmittance as a function of the angle of incidence of the etalon. All the incident angle sweeps designated in the legend were performed in the direction of increasing angle. These three sets of measurements were performed in the experimental period but not consecutively. The results indicate that although the transmission spectral width tends to increase with the angle of incidence, it varies widely for each measurement. The degree of variation exceeds the measurement uncertainty, suggesting that the conditions of the etalon changed with each sweep. The possible characteristics of the solid etalon that can cause such variations include non-uniform thickness and inhomogeneous strain on the etalon. Variations can then occur because the position of the laser irradiation on the solid etalon cannot be completely fixed. To detect a change in the Doppler profile resulting from laser cooling, the angles of incidence of the probe pulse on the etalon were set in the range tested above, resulting in the same degree of variation in the linewidth of the probe. Therefore, we estimated the spectral width of the probe pulse to be 8–16 GHz, based on the measured range of values shown in Extended Data Fig.3. Next, we examined the influence of saturation broadening, which also affects the frequency resolution. Using the effective intensity calculated from the fluence, pulse duration and spectral width of the spectrally narrowed probe pulse, the degradation of the frequency resolution owing to saturation broadening was at most 1 GHz. Thus, saturation broadening can be neglected. We considered the 8–16 GHz range of the frequency resolution as a systematic uncertainty in the evaluation of the fractional change. Hence, a conservative effective temperature was evaluated. Here we describe the allowed transitions and their intensities among the 13S–23Ptransitions used for laser cooling and Doppler spectroscopy. The transition matrix element is wheredis the electric dipole moment;Eis the electric field of light;n,LandSare the principal quantum number, orbital angular momentum and total spin angular momentum, respectively;JandMare the total angular momentum and its projection along the quantization axis, respectively. Subscripts e and g indicate the excited and ground states, respectively. The electric dipole moments, when we define the quantization axis of the atomic orbitals as thezaxis, are shown in Extended Data Fig.4a,b. The direction of projection of the electric dipole moment is shown at the top of each diagram. The allowed transitions induced by the electric field of light with the corresponding polarization vectors are represented by arrows. The numbers associated with the arrows indicate the square of the absolute value of each component of the electric dipole moment normalized to the following constant: whereeis the elementary charge anda0is the Bohr radius. For some transitions, the numbers are omitted because the absolute values of the electric dipole moments coincide with those of the other transitions that differ only in the sign ofM. The transition rates are proportional to the values shown in Extended Data Fig.4afor linearly polarized light parallel to thezaxis, and in Extended Data Fig.4bfor orthogonally polarized light. In our experiment, the polarizations of the cooling laser pulse and probe laser pulse in Doppler spectroscopy were linear and orthogonal to each other. Extended Data Fig.4a,bcan be used to evaluate the transition intensity of each pulse. Extended Data Fig.4cshows the spontaneous emission rates from the excited states to each ground state normalized by the total decay rateΓsp.≅3.13 × 108s–1from each excited state. By symmetry, the spontaneous emission rates from the states with negativeMevalues, which are omitted from the table in Extended Data Fig.4c, are equal to the corresponding rates between the states with the signs forMeandMgreversed. Extended Data Fig.4a–cshows that in the cooling process, during which the transitions are repeated many times, it is important to use a cooling laser with a spectral width comparable with the splitting in the transition. Otherwise, if we repeat the cooling cycle by transitioning to the 23P0and 23P1states, for example, the 13S1state becomes polarized and eventually makes transitions to these excited states dark. Moreover, the 13S1–23P2transition dominated the 1S–2Ptransitions. Therefore, we present our experimental results as functions of frequency relative to the 13S1–23P2frequency difference. Note that the resonance frequency observed at the one-photon transition is approximately 3 GHz higher than this frequency difference owing to the conservation laws of energy and momentum. We evaluated the time evolution of the momentum distribution of Ps under the influence of a cooling laser based on the Lindblad master equation: wheret,ħ,HandL(ρ) are the time, Dirac’s constant, Hamiltonian and Liouvillian, respectively. We considered the density matrixρin the space spanned by the simultaneous eigenstates of the momentum of Ps and atomic configurations in theL–Scoupling scheme. The interaction between Ps and the photon field was incorporated as an electric dipole interaction. This framework can describe the transitions between atomic orbitals through absorption, stimulated emission and spontaneous emission processes, as well as momentum changes because of photon recoil. We incorporated the relaxation of Ps due to annihilation processes into the master equation as a longitudinal relaxation process. Using the simulated velocity distribution shown in Fig.3a, we can simulate the fractional change (Fig.2b). The simulated Doppler profiles with and without the cooling laser irradiation were convolved by the spectral resolution to obtain\({S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)\)and\({S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)\), respectively. The spectral width of the probe pulse determines the spectral resolution. The argumentfis the relative frequency, which is the first-order Doppler shift calculated from the velocity of Ps. To express a part of the probed Ps atoms, which interacted with the cooling laser, we introduce an uncooled Ps fractionr. The fractional change can then be calculated as\((1-r)\frac{{S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)-{S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)}{{S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)}\). The parameterrwas determined by fitting this function to the measured data. Figure3bcompares the measured and simulated fractional changes. The filled circles are identical to those shown in Fig.2b. The thickness of the curve was determined on the basis of the frequency resolution in the range of 8–16 GHz. The measured data were well reproduced, with the best estimatedrranging from 0.18 to 0.40 and the spectral resolution shown above. The statistical uncertainty of the estimatedris typically 0.06 at the 1σconfidence level. The resultant fractionris reasonable under the experimental condition, and its consistency with the measured data supports the successful demonstration of the laser cooling of Ps. Extended Data Fig.5presents the corresponding Doppler profiles mentioned above. Similar to the experiment, the simulation evaluated the Doppler profiles 125 ns after Ps formation, following 100 ns of cooling laser irradiation. Components resonating with the frequency-swept cooling laser were decelerated and concentrated in the frequency domain corresponding to zero velocity. Compared with the case without cooling, the slow components showed a threefold increase. No change was observed in the detuned components, which did not resonate with the cooling laser. To illustrate the parameter design of the cooling laser in this study, we present typical examples of cooling time dependence and chirp rate dependence based on the simulations constructed here. Extended Data Fig.6adisplays the momentum distribution after cooling, evaluated as a function of cooling time while keeping the chirp rate constant. The optical frequency detuning of the cooling laser at the end of cooling was set to −9 GHz. As the cooling duration is extended, the sweep frequency range of the cooling laser increases, thereby enhancing the contrast in number between the cooled and uncooled components. However, due to the lifetime effects of Ps, the number of cooled atoms is found to decrease compared with shorter cooling times. The maximum number of cooled atoms is achieved at a cooling time of approximately 100 ns, which is the duration used in this study. Extended Data Fig.6bshows the momentum distribution after cooling when the chirp rate is varied, with the cooling time fixed at 100 ns. When the chirp rate exceeds the rate characterized by the recoil frequency associated with photon absorption and the natural emission rate, the proportion of atoms that cannot maintain the chirp cooling cycle increases, resulting in decreased efficiency. Note that this calculation assumes that the entire volume of the Ps gas is constantly exposed to the cooling laser.

The negative detuning indicates the direction away from the surface and the horizontal axis is intentionally reversed. The Doppler distribution of uncooled Ps follows the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, and the possible changes in the Doppler profile by cooling are characterised by parametersA,Scooled, Δf, andfcooled(defined in the text).

Irradiation by the cooling laser commenced at time zero.a, Dependence on the duration of the cooling laser. The chirp rate of the up-chirping cooling laser was the same as in the experiments of the present work, at 4.9 × 102GHz/μs, and cooling was terminated at −9 GHz relative to the 1S-2P transition frequency at rest. The durations were 40 ns, 100 ns, 200 ns and 400 ns. Due to computational resource constraints, calculation of the largely detuned components was truncated.b, Dependence on the chirp rate of the cooling laser. We set the chirp rates at 1.7 × 102GHz/μs, 5.0 × 102GHz/μs, 8.4 × 102GHz/μs and 11.7 × 102GHz/μs. Cooling was terminated at −9 GHz relative to the stationary Ps 1S-2P transition frequency. The duration of the cooling laser was fixed at 100 ns. While a larger chirp rate allows for interaction with a broader velocity range, the efficiency of cooling decreases because the frequency of the cooling laser changes by more than the recoil frequency during the relaxation time due to natural emission from the 2 P state.

Positronium is an exotic atom composed of a single negative electron and a positively charged antimatter positron. It is naturally very short-lived, but researchers including those from the University of Tokyo successfully cooled and slowed down samples of positronium using carefully tuned lasers. They hope this research will help others explore exotic forms of matter, and that such research might unlock the secrets of antimatter.
Some of our universe is missing. You may have heard such a bizarre statement if you’ve read much about cosmology in the last few decades. The reason scientists say this is because almost all the stuff we see in the universe is made from matter, including you and the planet you’re standing on. However, for a long time we’ve known about antimatter, which as the name suggests, is sort of the opposite of regular matter, in that antimatter particles share the same mass and other properties of their matter counterparts, but have an opposite charge. When matter and antimatter particles collide, they annihilate, and it’s widely believed they were created in equal amounts at the dawn of time. But that’s not what we see now.
“Modern physics only accounts for a part of the total energy of the universe. The study of antimatter might help us account for this discrepancy, and we’ve just taken a big step in this direction with our latest research,” said Associate Professor Kosuke Yoshioka from the Photon Science Center. “We have successfully slowed and cooled down exotic atoms of positronium, which is 50% antimatter. This means that for the first time, it can be explored in ways previously impossible, and that will necessarily include a deeper study of antimatter.”
Positronium sounds like something straight out of science fiction, and despite being very short-lived, it is very much a real thing. Think of it like the familiar atom hydrogen, with its central, positively charged and relatively large proton and tiny, negatively charged electron in orbit, except you swap the proton for the antimatter version of the electron, the positron. This yields an exotic atom which is electrically neutral but doesn’t have a large nucleus; instead the electron and positron exist in mutual orbit, making it a two-body system. Even hydrogen is a multibody system, as a proton is really three smaller particles, called quarks, stuck together. And because positronium is a two-body system, it can be completely described by traditional mathematical and physical theories, making it ideal to test predictions with extreme accuracy.
“For researchers like us, involved in what is called precision spectroscopy, being able to precisely examine the properties of cooled positronium means we can compare them with precise theoretical calculations of its properties,” said Yoshioka. “Positronium is one of the few atoms made up entirely of only two elementary particles, which allows for such exact calculations. The idea of cooling positronium has been around for around 30 years, but a casual comment by undergraduate student Kenji Shu, who is now an assistant professor in my group, prompted me to take on the challenge of achieving it, and we finally did.”
Yoshioka and his team had several difficulties to overcome when trying to cool positronium. Firstly, there is the issue of its short life: one-ten millionth of a second. Secondly, there is its extreme light mass. As it’s so lightweight, you can’t use a cold physical surface or other substance to cool positronium down, so the team used lasers. You may think lasers are very hot, but really, they are just packets of light, and it’s the way the light is used that determines the physical impact it has on something. In this case, a weak and finely tuned laser gently pushes against a positronium atom in the opposite direction to its movement, slowing it down and cooling it in the process. Doing this repeatedly and in as little as one-ten millionth of a second cooled portions of positronium gas down to about 1 degree above absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius), the coldest anything can get. Given positronium gas is at 600 kelvins, or 327 degrees Celsius, before cooling, this is quite a dramatic change in such a short space of time.
“Our computer simulations based on theoretical models suggest that the positronium gas might be even colder than we can currently measure in our experiments. This implies that our unique cooling laser is very effective at reducing the temperature of positronium and the concepts can hopefully help researchers study other exotic atoms,” said Yoshioka. “This experiment used a laser in just one dimension, however, and if we utilize all three, we can measure the properties of positronium even more precisely. These experiments will be significant because we may be able to study the effect of gravity on antimatter. If antimatter behaves differently to regular matter due to gravity, it could help explain why some of our universe is missing.”

				Pages 406-418 (compatible with EndNote, Reference Manager, ProCite, RefWorks) (compatible with BibDesk, LaTeX) Cementitious materials generally have large carbon footprints because of the high CO2emitted during Portland cement production. This is because limestone is used as an essential CaO resource, and its decomposition by calcination emits CO2. From this perspective, the concrete in urban buildings can be considered an urban mine of CaO resources. In this study, we propose obtaining a solidified product by crushing all the waste concrete, carbonating it, pressurizing it with a calcium bicarbonate solution, and drying it. The experimental results show that the bicarbonate solution, high-temperature conditions, and extended loading period produce a higher strength. In addition, neck growth at the contact surfaces of the carbonated concrete fines was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. Consequently, the proposed method indicates that the hardening mechanism is the cold sintering of calcium carbonate on the surface of fine-carbonated concrete particles. This method allows the developed blocks to be used semi-permanently with relatively low energy consumption through repeated crushing and re-pressurization.

Sign inhere","Researchers led by a team at the University of Tokyo have turned concrete from a demolished school building and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air into new blocks strong enough to build a house with. The process involved grinding the old concrete into powder, reacting it with CO2from the air, pressurizing it in layers in a mold and finally heating it to form the new block. Instead of making buildings from new concrete only, this technique could offer a way to recycle old materials while also trapping carbon dioxide in the process. The blocks could theoretically be remade again and again, through the same process.
A few years ago, researchers developeda new kind of concrete, which had the potential to reduce greenhouse gases and reuse waste from the construction industry.
The project was named C4S, which stands for Calcium Carbonate Circulation System for Construction, and led by Professor Takafumi Noguchi, as project manager, with Professor Ippei Maruyama leading on material development. Both researchers are from the Department of Architecture at the University of Tokyo. Together with a team they developed a method to combine old concrete with carbon dioxide, taken from the air or industrial exhaust, to create a new, durable material called calcium carbonate concrete. However, the resulting blocks were only a few centimeters long.
Now, they have taken this technology to the next level.
“We can make calcium carbonate concrete bricks large and strong enough to build regular houses and pavements,” said Maruyama. “These blocks can theoretically be used semipermanently through repeated crushing and remaking, a process which requires relatively low energy consumption. Now, concrete in old buildings can be thought of as a kind of urban mine for creating new buildings.”
Limestone is a key ingredient in Portland cement, which is typically used to make concrete. The rock provides durability and strength, while improving workability. However, limestone reserves are limited, and in some countries more than others, such as Japan. So attention is switching from creating new materials to maintaining and reusing what is already available.
“We are trying to develop systems that can contribute to a circular economy and carbon neutrality. In Japan, the current demand for construction material is less than in the past, so it is a good time to develop a new type of construction business, while also improving our understanding of this vital material through our research,” explained Maruyama.
Demolished concrete from a school building was crushed into a fine powder, sieved and then carbonated over three months. Carbonation is usually a slow, natural process which occurs when compounds in concrete, such as portlandite and calcium silicate hydrate, react with CO2in the air to form calcium carbonate. The researchers performed a sped-up version of this process to recreate the same kind of concrete you would find in older buildings. This was to test that they could still make strong new blocks even from older concrete.
The carbonated powder was then pressurized with a calcium bicarbonate solution and dried. In their previous experiment, the team created calcium carbonate concrete by pouring a bicarbonate solution through carbonated concrete powder and heating it. In this updated version, as well as heating the material, the team built the concrete up in layers in a mold, which compacted it under pressure. They found this enhanced the strength of the blocks.
“As part of the C4S project, we intend to construct a real two-story house by 2030,” said Maruyama. “Over the next few years, we also plan to move to a pilot plant, where we can improve production efficiency and industrial application, and work on creating much larger building elements, as we move towards making this material commercially available.”

Talking about regeneration,"Advertisement BMC Biologyvolume22, Article number:157(2024)Cite this article 2043Accesses 107Altmetric Metricsdetails The remarkable regenerative abilities observed in planarians and cnidarians are closely linked to the active proliferation of adult stem cells and the precise differentiation of their progeny, both of which typically deteriorate during aging in low regenerative animals. While regeneration-specific genes conserved in highly regenerative organisms may confer regenerative abilities and long-term maintenance of tissue homeostasis, it remains unclear whether introducing these regenerative genes into low regenerative animals can improve their regeneration and aging processes. Here, we ectopically express highly regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs) inDrosophila, a widely used low regenerative model organism. Surprisingly, HRJD expression impedes tissue regeneration in the developing wing disc but extends organismal lifespan when expressed in the intestinal stem cell lineages of the adult midgut under non-regenerative conditions. Notably, HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions. These findings together suggest that the introduction of highly regenerative species-specific genes can improve stem cell functions and promote a healthy lifespan when expressed in aging animals. Regeneration, an intricate process that rebuilds lost body parts, is a widespread phenomenon among metazoans, but the capacity for regeneration displays significant variation across different groups and species [1,2,3,4,5]. While certain animals like planarians and hydras possess the remarkable ability to regenerate their entire body from a small fragment, other groups with more complex body structures, such as mammals and insects, exhibit a diminished regenerative potential and can only regenerate specific tissues and/or organs to a limited extent. Furthermore, regenerative capacity often declines with aging in most species with limited regeneration abilities [2], resulting in increased susceptibility to organismal death upon injury. In contrast, animals that can achieve whole body regeneration, along with developmental reversion observed in the jellyfishTurritopsis, exhibit potential immortality [2,5,6]. Understanding the mechanisms underlying high regenerative ability and their relationship with aging represents a fundamental challenge in the field of developmental biology and gerontology with implications for regenerative medicine. Several cellular and molecular factors have been identified as determinants of regeneration capacity. Highly regenerative animals such as planarians and cnidarian polyps rely on pluripotent adult stem cells, called neoblasts and interstitial cells (i-cells), respectively [2,3,4,5,7]. These stem cells migrate to the injury sites and contribute to the formation of a blastema, an undifferentiated cellular mass, enabling the restoration of amputated body structures. Some vertebrates like salamanders and fish, which do not possess adult pluripotent stem cells, can regenerate organs after injury by recruiting blastema cells through dedifferentiation and/or the activation of quiescent lineage-restricted stem cells [1,2,4,5,8]. At the molecular level, the evolutionary conserved WNT signaling pathway promotes a wide range of regenerative events across species, including blastema formation in newts andHydra[1,2,3,4,5,8]. In contrast to the conserved regulators of regeneration, several genes are specific to highly regenerative animal groups and species: for instance, the newt geneProd1regulates re-patterning during limb regeneration [9,10], and viropana family (viropana 1–5) is upregulated during lens regeneration [11,12]. These species/group-specific genes might explain differences in regeneration capacity between species. Remarkably, ectopic expression ofviropana 1–5can enhance regeneration of the primordium ofDrosophilaeyes that maintain regenerative capacity during development [12]. This finding raises the possibility that heterologous induction of regenerative genes may accelerate tissue regeneration, at least in developing animals, and potentially provide a cue for developing novel regenerative therapies. However, it remains unknown whether heterologously-induced regenerative genes can improve regenerative and/or aging processes even when induced in post-developmental mature adults. Notably, given that basal metazoans such as Porifera, Ctenophore, Placozoa, and Cnidaria all exhibit robust regenerative abilities, it is conceivable that a common ancestor of all metazoans once possessed a high regenerative potential and independently lost genes related to high regenerative capacity in multiple phyla. Building upon this hypothesis, bioinformatics analysis has identified genes that are common among species with high regenerative abilities and absent in species with limited regenerative capacities (Fig.1A) [13]. Thehighlyregenerative species-specificJmjCdomain-encoding genes (HRJDs) are a group of such genes (with typically two or three orthologs per species) characterized by their JmjC domain (Fig.1A), yet their molecular functions remain unknown. Given their potential influence on the regenerative process, HRJDs may contribute to the high regeneration potential of highly regenerative animals. With this in mind, a question arises: what would happen if a low regenerative species, which has lost HRJDs, were to acquire them again? By ectopically expressing HRJDs in low regenerative animal models, we can investigate their impacts on regeneration as well as on aging processes, providing insight into the role of HRJDs. HRJD expression in whole body does not affect gross morphology.APhylogenetic tree of HRJD conservation. Green indicates species that possess HRJD gene(s) and gray indicates species that have lost HRJD gene(s). High regenerative ability indicates that the species can regenerate their whole body or anterior/posterior body parts, and low regenerative ability indicates that the species can only regenerate their appendage (limbs, tails, fins) or much smaller scale of tissues/organs. We referred to Cao et al. (2019) for the definition of regenerative ability [13].BProtein sequence of HRJDs used in this study, which derived fromDugesia japonica(DjHRJDa/b, hereafter simply described as HRJDa/b).

See also Additional file1: Fig. S1 Here, we express HRJDs in the fruit flyDrosophila melanogasterand evaluate their impact in vivo, especially by focusing on two epithelial tissues: developing wing discs and post-developmental adult midguts, both of which exhibit regeneration potential and can replenish damaged epithelial cells. In contrast to the predicted contribution of HRJDs in regeneration as observed in planarian, ectopic HRJD induction impedes regenerative responses and decreases organismal survival upon injury inDrosophila. Surprisingly, however, HRJD expression in the stem/progenitor population of the adult midguts extends organismal lifespan under the non-regenerative condition. Further investigations reveal that HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while keeping their differentiation fidelity in aged guts, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions. These findings provide evidence that genes specific to highly-regenerative animals can improve stem cell function as well as increase healthy lifespan upon heterologous expression in aging animals. Planarians are one of the most highly regenerative animals; they are capable of regenerating most body parts upon amputation and can even reconstruct their whole body from fragments [1,2,3,4,8,14]. Previous work has identified two HRJD orthologsHRJDaandHRJDbfrom two planarian species,Dugesia japonicaandSchmidtea mediterranea, where both HRJDs contain only the JmjC domain and the EF hand motif (Fig.1B) [13]. In functional assays using RNAi-mediated knockdown inD. japonica, these two HRJDs affect viability of organisms after amputation [13], suggesting that planarian HRJDs are associated with regeneration processes. We thus utilized these functional HRJDs inD. japonicaas representatives for the following studies and hereafter simply named them as HRJDa and HRJDb. To examine potential benefits and/or disadvantages of acquiring HRJDs, we then ectopically expressed HRJDs inDrosophila melanogaster, which has lost HRJD genes during evolution (Fig.1A), using the Gal4/UAS system (Additional file1: Fig. S1) [15]. We first introduced HRJDs in the whole body throughout development with the ubiquitous driverAct5C-Gal4(Fig.1C,Act5C-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b). The whole body expression of HRJDs neither caused developmental lethality nor changed the body weight of mature adults compared with theAct5C-Gal4>UAS-GFPcontrol (Fig.1D, E). We further assessed the gross morphology of adult wings and eyes under the ubiquitous expression of HRJDs. The wing size was not altered by HRJD expression (Fig.1F, G). Similarly,Act5C-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/bflies did not change the size of adult compound eyes (Fig.1H,I). These results indicate that HRJD expression does not disturb gross morphology of adult flies under homeostatic conditions, likely due to minimal impacts on developmental processes. Given that HRJDs are conserved only among highly regenerative animals, their primary functions may be related to regeneration processes. Indeed, both planarian HRJDa and HRJDb function in whole-body regeneration while their relative contribution is likely context-dependent: HRJDa is indispensable for the regeneration of amputated heads while HRJDb promotes organismal survival after two consecutive amputations [13]. To test whether heterologously-induced HRJDs can enhance regenerative responses inDrosophila, we examined their impacts on regeneration after ablation of the developing wing imaginal disc. TheDrosophilalarval imaginal discs, including wing discs, which are composed of columnar epithelial cells, exhibit regenerative capacity and restore morphology even after massive cell death [16,17] (Fig.2A, B). We utilized the genetic ablation system in which transient overexpression ofeiger, aDrosophila TNF ligand, induces apoptosis in the wing pouch region [17,18]. In this tissue ablation system, the temperature-sensitive form of the Gal4 repressor Gal80 (tub-Gal80ts) allows transient tissue ablation under the control of a wing pouch driverrn-Gal4.To circumvent the temporal expression associated with the Gal4/Gal80tssystem, we further introduced an additional binary expression system: the QF/QUAS system for HRJD induction (Fig.2A) [19,20]. When expressing HRJDs in the wing pouch with theWP-QF2driver during the entire process of recovery, we found thatWP-QF2>QUAS-HRJDsflies exhibit severe defects compared to controls (Fig.2C). Immunostaining of a mitotic marker, phosphohistone H3 (PH3), revealed that HRJD expression did not cause statistically significant difference in regenerative proliferation in the wing pouch (Fig.2D, E). Nevertheless, it is possible that insufficient damaged cell replenishment may occur in these conditions. Importantly, HRJD induction in the wing disc affected neither the development of the adult wing nor proliferation in wing discs under homeostatic condition (Fig.2F–I). These results suggest that HRJD expression does not facilitate regeneration in the developing wing disc epithelium.

Scale bars: 20 μm Most highly regenerative animals exhibit regeneration potential in mature adult stages [2,3,4,8], and thus one possibility is that HRJDs stimulate regenerative responses only in adults, where tissue-resident stem cells play an important role in homeostasis and regeneration. We thus tested the impact of HRJD expression on the regenerative capacity of theDrosophilaadult midgut. In the adult midgut, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) self-renew ISCs themselves and also generate differentiating progenitor cells called enteroblasts (EBs) and enteroendocrine progenitors (EEPs), which eventually differentiate into absorptive enterocytes (ECs) and secretory enteroendocrine cells (EEs), respectively (Fig.3A) [21,22,23,24]. The adult midgut activates proliferation of ISCs in response to orally-treated harmful chemicals such as paraquat and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a regenerative response that is essential for organismal survival [21,25,26,27,28]. We thus expressed HRJDs in ISCs and EBs using theesg-Gal4(esg-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b) driver and tested survival against paraquat/DSS damage. Similar to the wing regeneration assay, continuous expression of HRJDs viaesg-Gal4significantly impaired organismal survival upon the chemical challenges, with a stronger effect for HRJDa (Additional file1: Fig. S2A and S2B). By contrast, survival during 11 days of control feeding (5% sucrose) was not significantly decreased by HRJD expression (Additional file1: Fig. S2C), raising a possibility that abnormal regenerative response compromises the survival upon intestinal damage. We thus examined ISC proliferation after paraquat feeding by counting the number of cells marked with a mitotic marker, anti-PH3 staining, and found that induction of HRJDa significantly suppressed ISC division (Additional file1: Fig. S2D), which is consistent with the stronger decline in survival rate. Concordant with the wing ablation experiments, these results suggest that continuous HRJD expression causes detrimental effects to regenerative capacity. HRJD expression compromises regeneration in the adult midgut.ASchematics of theDrosophilaadult midgut.

See also Additional file1: Fig. S2 Because theesg-Gal4driver is active not only in adult ISCs/EBs but also in the proliferative adult midgut progenitors in the larval midguts and larval imaginal discs [29,30], continuous HRJD expression may cause internal organ defects associated with development. To temporally restrict HRJD expression to the adult stage, we next set up an experiment where HRJD expression starts only in adults after eclosion from pupa by combiningesg-Gal4withtub-Gal80ts(esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/b) (Fig.3B); however, neither HRJDa nor HRJDb improved organismal survival upon paraquat/DSS feeding (Fig.3C, D). Instead, HRJDa expression caused a slight but significant decrease in survival rate compared to controls (esg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFP), while HRJDb expression did not lead to a statistically significant decline of survival (Fig.3C, D). Survival under control feeding (5% sucrose) was comparable betweenesg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFPandesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/b(Fig.3E), suggesting that the impaired survival ofesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDais specific to regenerative contexts. We also found that, after paraquat feeding, mitotic cell numbers in HRJD expressing flies decreased slightly (Fig.3F, G), suggesting the possibility of impaired regeneration. These results indicate that post-developmental expression of HRJDs does not enhance intestinal regeneration in adult flies. Highly-regenerative animals are often resistant to organismal aging and have long lifespan; some species like the jellyfishTurritopsiseven revert their early developmental stages under harsh environments and are considered to be potentially immortal [2,6]. Although heterologous expression of HRJDs does not augment tissue regeneration in either developing or adultDrosophilatissues, we further investigated whether HRJDs influence organismal lifespan under homeostatic conditions in which no experimental injuries are applied to fly adults. We observed that post-developmental HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs (esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/b) significantly extended organismal lifespan both in females (Fig.4A) and males (Fig.4B). In contrast, continuous HRJD expression in the whole body (Act5C-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b) shortened males’ lifespan (Fig.4C, D). Moreover, HRJD expression in differentiated ECs (NP1-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b) also negatively impacted female lifespan, likely due to developmental abnormalities since EC-specific HRJD expression in the adult stage did not decrease survival (Additional file1: Fig. S3A-S3D). These results suggest that spatio-temporally regulated induction of HRJDs in adult ISCs/EBs can be beneficial for adult flies under homeostatic conditions.

See also Additional file1: Fig. S3 Further investigation revealed the distinct impacts of HRJDa and HRJDb on organismal lifespan: while continuous expression of HRJDa viaesg-Gal4 (esg-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa)shortened lifespans for both males and females,esg-Gal4>UAS-HRJDbprolonged female lifespans but shortened male lifespans (Additional file1: Fig. S3E and S3F). The ortholog-dependent phenotypic differences were also reported in planarian regeneration [13]. To address the mechanisms of lifespan extension associated with post-developmental HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs, we focused onesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDsmidguts in the following experiments. Age-related mortality accompanies intestinal barrier dysfunction and disruption of cell–cell junction in the gut epithelium across species [31,32,33,34]. Given that aging phenotypes are more severe in female flies than male flies [35], we first tested barrier function of theesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bfemale midgut using the Smurf assay, in which orally-administered blue dye spreads throughout the entire body when the intestinal barrier is disrupted (Smurf + , Fig.5A) [31,35]. Consistent with lifespan extension, post-developmental HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs significantly decreased the ratio of Smurf + adults at 30 days old, a time point where age-related organismal death starts (Fig.4A and Fig.5A), suggesting that barrier function is maintained in aged flies that express HRJDs in ISCs/EBs. We further assessed the localization of septate junction markers (Dlg, Tsp2A, Mesh, Ssk), which diffuse in cytoplasm in the aged midgut [33,36,37,38]. The diffusion of the Dlg protein in aged midguts was significantly suppressed inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bmidguts (Fig.5B, C). Similarly, peripheral localization of Tsp2A, Mesh, and Ssk proteins was also maintained inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bmidguts compared with control (esg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFP) midguts (Fig.5D–I). Given that HRJDs in ISCs/EBs affect localization of junctional components in ECs, we next tested if HRJDs non-autonomously affect junctional integrity. To this end, we performed a mosaic experiment where HRJDs were clonally induced using the esgFLPout system [26]. Clonal induction of HRJDs improved junctional localization of Ssk both inside and outside the clones (Additional file1: Fig. S4A and S4B), supporting the conclusion that HRJDs’ effect is non-cell autonomous. We then examined JNK activation in ECs, which is associated with barrier dysfunction in the aged intestine [27,36]. HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs significantly repressed transcription ofpuckered(puc), a downstream target of JNK signaling in the whole midgut (Fig.5J), and indeed the intensity ofpuc-lacZreporter decreased in ECs upon HRJD induction (Fig.5K,L). HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs thus suppresses JNK signaling in ECs in the aged midgut, which is mediated by either a non-autonomous function of HRJDs or residual HRJD proteins in newly differentiated ECs. These results indicate that HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs contributes to the prolonged maintenance of the junctional integrity as well as gut barrier function in the aged intestine. HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs suppresses age-related gut barrier dysfunction.Aesgts-mediated HRJD induction decreased Smurf( +) ratio at day 30.

Scale bars: 50 μm In addition to the intestinal barrier dysfunction, aberrant activation of ISC mitosis and accumulation of mis-differentiated ISC progenies are also common age-related phenotypes in theDrosophilaadult midgut [27,31,33,39]. In 30-days old control midguts,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFP+cells exhibited hallmarks of age-related mis-differentiation into ECs such as increased ploidy and enlarged nuclear size (Fig.6A) [27]. By contrast, we found that HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs suppressed these mis-differentiation phenotypes (Fig.6A, B), which are consistent with the amelioration of age-related barrier dysfunction inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bmidguts. Surprisingly, however,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bdid not suppress age-related increase in ISC proliferation but rather enhanced it in 30-day old midguts (Fig.6C, D). The enhancement of ISC proliferation was specific to the aged intestine sinceesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDsdid not affect PH3+cell number in 10-day-old young midguts (Additional file1: Fig. S4E). These results raised the possibility that HRJD expression augments the mitotic activity of stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity during aging.

Scale bars: 50 μm To test this hypothesis, we first measured the expression of cell type markers (Deltafor ISCs,nubfor ECs, andprosfor EEs) by RT-qPCR of whole midguts. Bothnubandprosare negatively regulated by Esg [40,41], and accumulation ofesg+mis-differentiated cells accompanies the downregulation of EC-related genes in aged midguts [27]. Consistent with enhanced ISC proliferation,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDasignificantly upregulatedDelta(Dl) expression in 30-day old midguts (Fig.6E). More importantly,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDaalso upregulatednubandpros, which supports our hypothesis that HRJDs improve proper differentiation of ISC progenies. Inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDb, onlyDl, but notnubandpros, was upregulated when whole midguts were used as sample (Fig.6E). Next, we focused on the posterior midgut where both HRJDa and HRJDb prevent mis-differentiation of EBs (Fig.6A) and examined cell type composition using the combination of markersesgts>GFP(ISC/EB),Dl-lacZ(ISC/EEP), and anti-Pros (EEP/EE). Consistent with the prevention of EB mis-differentiation,esgts-mediated HRJD expression decreased EBs (esg+Dl−Pros−) and increased polyploid ECs (esg−Dl−Pros−) compared to the control midgut (Fig.6F, G). These results indicate that HRJDs improve differentiation fidelity in ISC lineage. To address the potential mechanism of HRJD-dependent maintenance of ISC functions, we focused on the JAK-STAT pathway since its activation promotes both ISC proliferation and differentiation into ECs [26,42,43]. In young mature midguts, STAT activity is largely restricted toesg+ISCs/EBs [26,42,44]. In aged midguts, however, a subset of polyploid cells exhibited weak signal of the STAT reporter10×STAT-GFP, likely due to the accumulation of mis-differentiated EBs (Fig.6H). Notably, HRJD induction canceled such ectopic STAT activation in polyploid cells and rather enhanced STAT activity in diploid ISCs/EBs (Fig.6H,I), which is consistent with our observations that HRJDs boost ISC functions during aging. These results suggest that HRJD expression accelerates the generation of differentiated ECs via JAK-STAT activation. In the healthy homeostatic intestine, ISC division and subsequent differentiation into ECs is coupled with the loss of old ECs [45,46]. Interestingly, we found thatesg-lineage clones that express HRJDs rapidly replaced pre-existing cells by generating polyploid ECs (Additional file1: Fig. S4A, S4C, and S4D). In addition, more cells exhibited cleaved Dcp1, an apoptotic marker [47,48], in 30-day oldesgts>HRJDsmidguts (Additional file1: Fig. S4F and S4G), implying that HRJD induction promotes turnover of midgut epithelial cells. Collectively, our data show that post-developmental expression of HRJDs improves stem cell functions in the aged intestine. In this study, we demonstrate that post-developmental expression of planarian HRJD genes in theDrosophilaadult ISCs/EBs can suppress age-related intestinal dysfunctions and extend organismal lifespan, while their continuous expression throughout the entire developmental process hampers regenerative responses and principally shortens lifespan. Notably, HRJDs in adult ISCs/EBs boost the age-related increase of ISC proliferation but do not cause age-related mis-differentiation of ISC progenies (Fig.7). These HRJD-mediated outcomes are distinct from those mediated by typical anti-aging manipulations such as antibiotic treatment and metabolic intervention, which ameliorate both ISC over-proliferation and mis-differentiation [24,31,49]. Therefore, heterologously induced HRJDs create the neomorphic state in the aged intestine (Fig.7). Given the age-related increase of chronic cellular stresses [24,27,36,49,50], we speculate that the HRJD-dependent ISC activation and their proper differentiation improve organismal fitness by enabling active turnover of damaged intestinal cells. Graphical summary. Schematic model for the impact of HRJDs on intestinal homeostasis. In aged wildtype midguts, ISCs over-proliferate, and their daughters fail to differentiate into mature ECs, resulting in an accumulation of mis-differentiated cells (esg+large polyploid). HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs further enhances ISC proliferation but suppresses mis-differentiation likely through upregulation of JAK-STAT signaling, which results in successful maintenance of the gut barrier and an extension of organismal lifespan Our investigation implies that the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway underlies the HRJD-mediated enhancement of ISC functions. Surprisingly, however, the expression of most mitogens including upstream ligands of JAK-STAT signaling (upd1,upd2,upd3) were not upregulated by HRJD induction (Additional file1: Fig. S4H), raising the possibility that HRJDs activate STAT by modulating intracellular signaling factors. Such ligand-independent STAT activation can be achieved via non-receptor type tyrosine kinases like Src and Abl [51]. Given that the typical JmjC family proteins function as histone demethylase or protein hydroxylase [52], HRJDs may epigenetically target these tyrosine kinases. Notably,DrosophilaJarid2 (Jumonji, AT rich interactive domain 2) activates EGFR signaling upon overexpression in ISCs/EBs without changing ligand expression [53]. Our findings, together with these reports, suggest a cell-autonomous role of JmjC family proteins in regulating proliferative signaling in stem cell lineages. Intriguingly, Jarid2 expression in ISCs/EBs leads to ISC over-proliferation as well as barrier dysfunction, resulting in reduced lifespan [53], which is the opposite adult phenotype of HRJD expression in ISC lineages. Moreover, in contrast to the nuclear localization of histone demethylase KDM8 [54,55], the closest paralog of HRJDs, ectopically induced HRJDs localize in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus both in vitro (S2 cells) and in vivo (wing discs and adult midguts) (Additional file1: Fig. S1B-S1D). This is a common localization pattern of JmjC-domain only proteins [55,56] and implies that an unknown mechanism may operate when HRJDs work as a potential histone demethylase. In the future, it will thus be critical to examine the detailed molecular function of HRJDs to understand their impact on stem cell lineages. Although HRJDs have been identified as genes conserved between highly regenerative animals [13], it is unclear whether HRJDs alone are sufficient to enhance regenerative responses. Our investigations revealed that ectopic expression of HRJDs failed to improve regeneration of developing wing discs and adult midguts inDrosophila(Figs.2and3), likely through the attenuation of regenerative growth. However, it should be noted that we induced HRJDs before tissue injury and maintained their expression during regeneration period. Given thatHRJDbis upregulated in the late phase of planarian regeneration (3 days after amputation) [13], strict regulation of HRJD induction might be important for their proper function as true regeneration regulators. On the other hand, the expression level ofHRJDaremains constant during planarian regeneration [13], which is recapitulated in our experiments. Another possibility is that a high regeneration ability can be achieved by cooperation between HRJDs and other unidentified genes that have been lost during evolution, which should be addressed in future studies. During the normal aging process in theDrosophilaadult midgut, ISC over-proliferation is closely linked with other aging phenotypes, and suppression of ISC division can prevent the accumulation of mis-differentiated ISC progenies and extend organismal lifespan [24,36,49,50]. In contrast, HRJDs enhance age-related ISC activation but can alleviate mis-differentiation and extend lifespan, suggesting that it is not ISC activation itself but rather mis-differentiation of ISC progenies that principally drives age-related mortality. Consistently, manipulation of mitotic spindle orientation, which affects the cell fate of daughter cells [57,58,59], can extend organismal lifespan without changing mitotic activity of ISCs [59]. Of note, in contrast toDrosophilaISCs which over-proliferate in aged midguts, many adult stem cells decrease their activity and abundance during aging both inDrosophilaand mammals [24,60,61]. Future investigations for mechanisms of HRJD-mediated stem cell rejuvenation will provide clues to develop new anti-aging strategies. In this study, we established aDrosophilamodel in which HRJDs are heterologously expressed in specific tissue or cell type using binary expression systems and demonstrated that HRJDs can improve proliferative/differentiation capacity of ISCs in the aged midgut. Although continuous HRJD expression in the wing disc and in the adult midgut impairs tissue regeneration upon injury, restricted HRJD expression in post-developmental adult ISCs/EBs enhances mitotic activity of ISCs as well as maintains their differentiation fidelity in the aged flies, leading to the prevention of age-related intestinal barrier dysfunction and the extension of organismal lifespan. Our HRJD-expressing model will serve as a valuable resource to understand unprecedented mechanisms of stem cell rejuvenation in the future.

See Additional file2: Table S1 for genotypes in each figure. We used female flies unless otherwise noted in the figures. Experimental crosses that did not involve Gal80ts-mediated inhibition of Gal4 were performed at 25 °C. When using Gal80ts, experimental crosses were maintained at 18 °C. For genetic wing ablation experiments (Fig.2), F1 larvae were raised at 18 °C until day 7, incubated at 29 °C for the next 40 h, and then maintained at 18 °C until the adult hatched or dissection. For lifespan assays, midgut staining, and Smurf assays (Figs.3,4,5, and6), F1 adults were transferred to 29 °C 3 days after eclosion until the experiments. Midgut staining and Smurf assays were performed after 7 or 27 days of 29 °C incubation (young: day 10 adults, old: day 30 adults). For esgFLPout experiments, flies were maintained at 18 °C until 50 days, and 50-day old adults were transferred to 29 °C and analyzed after 10 days (final 60-day old). To express HRJDs using the Gal4/UAS or the QF/QUAS system, we constructed a vector containingHRJDaorHRJDbunder the control of either the UAS sequence or QUAS sequence. Namely, we amplified HRJDa and HRJDb sequence from codon-optimized synthesized DNAs (pUCIDT-HRJDa and pUCIDT-HRJDb, IDT, Additional file3: Supplementary texts S1) forDjHRJDa(Genbank # LC408963) andDjHRJDb(Genbank # LC408964), respectively. UAS-HRJDa and UAS-HRJDb were constructed by ligating HRJDa and HRJDb into pUAST-attB (DGRC 1419), respectively (digested by EcoRI/NotI). Similarly, QUAS-HRJDa and QUAS-HRJDb were constructed by ligating HRJDa and HRJDb into pQUAS-WALIUM20 (DGRC 1474), respectively (digested by NheI/EcoRI). To construct UAS-3xFLAG-HRJDs, we PCR-amplified the coding sequences of HRJDs from pUCIDT-HRJDs by gene-specific primers with 3xFLAG tag at 5′-end of the forward primers, and the amplicons were then ligated into a pUAST-attB vector digested by EcoRI/NotI using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara, 639,649). The landing site for each construct was {3xP3-RFP.attP}ZH-86Fb. Injection and selection were performed by WellGenetics (Taiwan, R.O.C.).

DrosophilaS2 cells were grown at 25 °C in Schneider’sDrosophilamedium (GIBCO, 21,720,001) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (FUJIFILM Wako, 168–23,191). To examine the expression pattern of HRJDs through immunostaining, 1 × 106cells were seeded in 6-well plates containing Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin and were transfected with 800 ng of pAc5-3xFLAG-HRJDs using Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, 301,427) following the manufacturer’s protocol. To prepare pAc5-3xFLAG-HRJDs, we amplified the coding sequences of HRJDs from pUCIDT-HRJDs (Additional file3: Supplementary texts S1) by gene-specific primers with 3xFLAG tag at 5′-end of the forward primers, and the amplicons were then ligated into a pAc5-STABLE2-neo (Addgene, 32,426) [70] digested with EcoRI/XhoI by In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara, 639,649). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and the medium was replaced with fresh Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), blocked in PBST with 5% normal donkey serum (PBSTn), and incubated with primary antibodies in PBSTn overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then washed with PBST, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33,342 suspended in PBSTn and washed again with PBST. Images were captured using an LSM880 (Zeiss). The primary antibody used was a mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1: 2000, Sigma, F1804). The secondary antibodies used were Goat anti-Mouse IgG2b Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor™ 555 (1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21147). Hoechst 33,342 (0.4 μM; Invitrogen, H3570) was used for nuclear staining. Images were analyzed and edited using Fiji/ImageJ software (NIH). To examine the expression of HRJDs, 2.5 × 105cells were seeded in 24-well plates containing Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin and were transfected with 200 ng of pAc5-3xFLAG-HRJDs using Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, 301,427) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, and the medium was replaced with fresh Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 50 μL RIPA buffer supplemented with cOmplete ULTRA EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 05892953001). The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. The supernatant was mixed with SDS, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to western blotting. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, IPVH00010) for immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked with 4% skimmed milk diluted in 1 × Tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20. Immunoblotting was performed using the below-mentioned antibodies, which were diluted with 4% skim milk. The signals were visualized using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, WBKLS0500) and FUSION SOLO. 7S. EDGE (Vilber-Lourmat). Contrast and brightness adjustments were applied using the Fiji/ImageJ software (NIH). The primary antibody used was mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1: 5000, Sigma, F1804). Mouse anti-alpha tubulin (DM1A) monoclonal antibody (1: 5000, Sigma, T9026) was used as loading control. The secondary antibody used was HRP-conjugated goat/rabbit/donkey anti-mouse IgG (1: 10,000, Promega, W402B). 5 mM paraquat (Sigma, 856,177) and 5% (w/v) DSS (MP Biomedicals, 160,110) were dissolved in 5% (w/v) sucrose solution. Filter paper (Whatman 3MM) was soaked with 400 μL of these reagents and placed into empty vials. For histological analyses, flies were fed with the reagent solution for 1 day. For the survival assay, flies were transferred to new vials and dead flies (determined by immobility and showing no response to tapping) were counted every day. 5% sucrose was used for control feeding. Samples were dissected in 1 × PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min (wing discs) and 30–45 min (adult midgut) at room temperature (RT), respectively. The following primary antibodies were used with indicated dilution into 1 × PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100: rabbit anti-PH3 (Millipore 06–570, 1:1000), mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804, 1:1000), mouse anti-Dlg (DSHB 4F3, 1:100), rabbit anti-GFP (MBL 598, 1:500), rat anti-GFP (Nacalai tesque 04404–26, 1:400), rabbit anti-Tsp2A (Izumi et al., 2016, 1:1000) [71], rabbit anti-Mesh (Izumi et al., 2012, 1:1000) [72], rabbit anti-Ssk (Izumi et al., 2016, 1:1000) [71], chicken anti-β-galactosidase (Abcam ab9361, 1:500), anti-cDcp1 (Cell Signaling Technology 9578, 1:200). After overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C, samples were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Invitrogen, 1:500) for 1 h at RT. Hoechst 33,342 (Invitrogen, final concentration: 10 μg/ml) was used to visualize DNA. Wing discs were mounted as described previously [73,74]. Samples were mounted in Slowfade Diamond (ThermoFisher, S36963) and imaged with confocal microscopy Zeiss LSM880 or Zeiss LSM980. We referred to Rera et al. (2012) for the Smurf assay conditions [35]. To prepare the feeding medium, 100 μL of 50% (w/v) brilliant blue FCF (Wako, 027–12842, final 2.5%) and 100 μL of 5% (w/v) sucrose were added to a vial containing 2 ml of cornmeal-agar food. After mixing with a spatula, a Whatman 1 filter (1001–020) was put on the feeding medium. Flies were fed with this medium at 25 °C for 1 day, after which they were transferred to a new vial containing cornmeal-agar food without blue dye to clean the epidermis. Two hours after the transfer, Smurf phenotype was checked. We classified the Smurf phenotype as blue dye leakage outside abdomen (thorax, head, legs). Total RNA was purified from 10 to 15 midguts using the ReliaPrep RNA Tissue Miniprep System (Promega). cDNA was made from 100 or 200 ng of RNA using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa). Quantitative PCR was performed using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) and the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher). RpL32 was used as an internal control. Primer sequences are listed in Additional file4: Table S2. We created the phylogenetic tree of representative organisms using the NCBI taxonomy browser (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi). The species examined areAmphimedon queenslandica(Porifera),Mnemiopsis leidyi(Ctenophora),Trichoplax adhaerens(Placozoa),Hydra vulgaris(Cnidaria),Ptychodera flava(Hemichordata),Acanthaster planci(Echinodermata),Branchiostoma floridae(Cephalochordata),Ciona intestinalis(Tunicata),Danio rerio(Teleostei),Homo sapiens,Mus musculus(Mammalia),Schmidtea mediterranea(Platyhelminthes),Caenorhabditis elegans(Nematoda), andDrosophila melanogaster(Arthropoda). These species, except forD. rerio,H. sapiens,M. musculus,C. elegans, andD. melanogaster, are known to have HRJDs and exhibit high regeneration ability [13]. The pictures were downloaded from PhyloPic, and the color of some were changed from black to blue. Credits: Bennet McComish (B. floridae), Malio Kodis (M. leidyi), and Markus A. Grohme (S. mediterranea,https://www.phylopic.org/images/93f9611c-0cbd-4a14-92da-004a4521e21f/schmidtea-mediterranea). For wing discs, we counted PH3 positive cells in the pouch region, which develops into the adult wing. After binarization, the number of PH3 positive cells was counted using the Analyze Particles function in Fiji/ImageJ and subsequently confirmed or corrected by visual review of the images. For adult midguts, the number of PH3 positive cells in the posterior midguts was manually counted. To quantify junctional and cytoplasmic intensity, a line that was orthogonal to one side of a cell was drawn, and then the plot profile was calculated for the line. We defined the junctional intensity as the highest value in that profile and defined cytoplasmic intensity as the value 20 pixels (~ 2.6 μm) away from the highest value. Three lines were drawn for one cell and the average of the three was used to represent the junctional/cytoplasmic ratio for the cell. Six polyploid cells were randomly selected from each image for quantification. The signal intensity ofpuc-lacZand10×STAT-GFPreporters was quantified using Fiji/ImageJ. The nuclei of large polyploid cells (forpuc-lacZ) and Pros−diploid cells (for10×STAT-GFP) were selected as ROIs using the polygon selection tool. The reporter intensity in each ROI was quantified using the Measure command. Nuclei ofesg-Gal4>UAS-GFPpositive cells were traced by the polygon selection tool and added as ROI in Fiji/ImageJ. The size of each ROI was quantified using the Measure command. Cell number was quantified using Fiji/ImageJ. To count the total cell number, Hoechst signal was processed as following: (1) despeckle, (2) binarization, (3) fill hole, (4) watershed, (5) analyze particle. The following cell number was manually counted using the cell counter function:esg>GFP+cells,Dl-lacZ+cells, Pros+cells, and cDcp1+cells. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel and RStudio. Two tailedttests were used for comparisons between two groups. One-way ANOVAs with post hoc Tukey tests were performed when comparing three or more groups. Log-rank tests were used for comparison of survival curve. Significance is indicated in the figures as follows: *P≤ 0.05, **P≤ 0.01, ***P≤ 0.001, not significant (N.S.):P> 0.05. Bar graphs show mean ± standard error. Boxplots show median (thick line in the box), first and third quartiles (bottom and top of the box), minimum value (lower whisker), and maximum value (upper whisker). Dots in bar graphs and boxplots indicate individual values. Violin plots portray the distribution of individual values.

They found the transferred gene suppressed an age-related intestinal issue in the flies. Their results suggest studying genes specific to animals with high regenerative capability may uncover new mechanisms for rejuvenating stem cell function and extending the healthy lifespan of unrelated organisms.
Do you want to live forever? Some do, some don’t. But we all want to live healthily for however long we have, and a big part of medical research is about this aspect of longevity. One idea, which might sound a little like science fiction, is to upgrade the human body in such a way that it can regenerate itself when injured, diseased, or when aging starts taking its toll, a bit like the superhero character Wolverine from the popular comic book and film seriesX-Men. Of course, we’re nowhere near that stage yet, but progress is being made in the world of regenerative medicine, albeit the test subjects are just flies for now.
“In animals capable of whole-body regeneration, such as flatworms and jellyfish, specific genes may help allow regeneration and maintain long-term stem cell functions. Conversely, mammals and insects, which have limited regenerative abilities, may have lost these genes during evolution,” said Associate Professor Yuichiro Nakajima. “It is unclear whether reintroducing these regeneration-associated genes in low regenerative animals could affect their regeneration and aging processes. In our recent study, we focused on the group of genes unique to animals with high regenerative capacity, named highly regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs), and transferred them into the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster, to test their effects.”
Nakajima’s team hoped upgraded fruit flies would regenerate tissue if injured, which didn’t happen. However, Hiroki Nagai, an expert in fruit fly intestines, noticed something else.
“Nagai discovered some novel phenotypes, characteristics that manifest from genes in a given set of conditions,” said Nakajima. “HRJDs promoted greater intestinal stem cell division, whilst also suppressing intestinal cells that were mis-differentiating, or going wrong in aged flies. This is in contrast to the use of antibiotics, for example, which might suppress mis-differentiated intestinal cells, but also suppress intestinal stem cell division. For this reason, HRJDs had a measurable effect on the lifespans of fruit flies, which opens the door, or at least provides clues, for the development of new anti-aging strategies. After all, human and insect intestines have surprisingly much in common on a cellular level.”
Finding this out was not without difficulties, however. Though fruit flies are famous test subjects for biological research, given their relatively short lives and fast rates of reproduction and maturation, their aging process still takes around two months, which affected the experimental schedules for Nakajima’s team, who were also busy with other things. Now that they have reached a striking conclusion, though, there is still much work to be done.
“Details of the molecular workings of HRJDs are still unresolved. And it’s unclear whether they work alone or in combination with some other component,” said Nakajima. “Therefore, this is just the start of the journey, but we know now that our modified fruit flies can serve as a valuable resource to uncover unprecedented mechanisms of stem cell rejuvenation in the future. In humans, intestinal stem cells decrease in activity with age, so this research is a promising avenue for stem cell-based therapies.”

Transient structure in fly leg holds clue to insect shape formation,"You have full access to thisopen accessarticle 1318Accesses 58Altmetric 7Mentions Explore all metrics Organisms display a remarkable diversity in their shapes. Although substantial progress has been made in unraveling the mechanisms that govern cell fate determination during development, the mechanisms by which fate-determined cells give rise to the final shapes of organisms remain largely unknown. This study describes in detail the process of the final shape formation of the tarsus, which is near the distal tip of the adult leg, during the pupal stage inDrosophila melanogaster. Days-long live imaging revealed unexpectedly complicated cellular dynamics. The epithelial cells transiently form the intriguing structure, which we named the Parthenon-like structure. The basal surface of the epithelial cells and localization of the basement membrane protein initially show a mesh-like structure and rapidly shrink into the membranous structure during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure. Furthermore, macrophage-like cells are observed moving around actively in the Parthenon-like structure and engulfing epithelial cells. The findings in this research are expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in shaping the final structure of the adult tarsus. Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript. Organisms exhibit a tremendous variety in their shapes. Understanding the mechanisms forming the various organismal shapes has been one of the important subjects in biology. Over the past several decades, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms that determine cell fate during development. This has led us to understand that the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination are conserved among closely related species. In contrast to the mechanisms of fate determination, how fate-determined cells form final shapes remains elusive. Since shapes can differ dramatically between closely related species that are expected to share the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination, differences in final shape formation processes should greatly contribute to making the shape differences. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of final shape formation is of great importance to understand the mechanisms of formation and diversification of organismal shapes. Insects account for more than half of living species and show extreme diversity in their shapes (Snodgrass1935; Grimaldi and Engel2005). This makes insects attract the attention of many researchers. Insect legs have also evolved into various shapes to adapt to various environments. Generally, they consist of several segments, which are the coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus, and pretarsus, in a proximal to distal direction. Among these segments, the tarsus, located near the tip of the leg, is unique in that it is further subdivided into several segments called tarsal segments or tarsomeres. The number of tarsal segments varies between species and ranges from one to five. Even within the same individual, it sometimes varies depending on the developmental stage and on the body segments in which the leg is formed (Angelini et al.2012). In addition to the number of tarsal segments, the shapes of tarsal segments are also variable. For example, the tarsus of the first leg in the male diving beetle is flat and expanded, making a fan-shaped sucking disc, while that in mosquitos is very long and slender (Kojima2017). This morphological diversity makes the insect tarsus a good model for studying the mechanisms of final shape formation and its diversification. In the adult leg ofDrosophila melanogaster, the tarsus consists of five segments, the tarsal segments 1–5, from proximal to distal direction. The adult leg develops from the leg disc, which is a mono-layered epithelial sheet formed during embryogenesis. During the larval stage, the leg disc becomes a sack-like structure, part of which forms the disc proper that differentiates into the adult leg, while the other part becomes the peripodial membrane that covers the disc proper. With the growth of the leg disc, the disc proper is subdivided into concentric regions corresponding to the adult leg segments through the exquisite regulatory interaction of patterning genes. (reviewed in Kojima2004,2017; Estella et al.2012; Ruiz-Losada et al.2018) Accordingly, the most central part corresponds to the most distal segment (pretarsus), and the most peripheral part corresponds to the most proximal segment (coxa). Cells that develop into each tarsal segment are determined by the end of the late third instar. During these processes, the leg disc is folded and remains covered by the peripodial membrane. After the third instar, the larval cuticle changes to form the puparium, within which pupal development proceeds for about 4 days. Immediately after the puparium is formed, imaginal discs begin to join together and form the adult body. By 12 h after puparium formation (APF), the pupal cuticle is formed and encloses the developing adult tissue. During these processes, the leg disc everts and elongates with the breakage and retraction of the peripodial membrane (Proag et al.2019). Around the puparium formation, each tarsal segment is already recognizable morphologically by the epithelial folding or constriction between tarsal segments. The development of the tarsus by this stage has been extensively studied (reviewed in Kojima2004,2017; Ruiz-Losada et al.2018). Regions corresponding to individual tarsal segments are determined by the region-specific expression of genes encoding transcription factors and their regulatory interactions (Kojima et al.2000; Kozu et al.2006; Tajiri et al.2007; Pueyo and Couso2008; Greenberg and Hatini2009; Natori et al.2012). This leads to the activation of Notch signaling in the distal end of each tarsal segment through regulation of the expression of Notch ligands, Delta, and Serrate, just proximal to the Notch active region in each tarsal segment (de Celis et al.1998; Bishop et al.1999; Rauskolb and Irvine1999; Rauskolb2001; Córdoba et al.2016). This Notch activation induces the region-specific regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell death, resulting in the formation of constrictions between tarsal segments (Córdoba and Estella2014,2018; de Madrid et al.2015; Monier et al.2015). Recently, the involvement of the tissue-wide mechanical force generated by cell proliferation has also been suggested to contribute to the formation of constrictions in concert with the Notch signaling pathway (Rodríguez et al.2024). After the early events described above, the process of forming the final shape of the adult leg continues to progress through the subsequent pupal stage, which lasts another 3.5 days or more, but much of its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Although several aspects of the shape-making process, such as changes in the external shape and formation of joints and pulvilli, have been previously reported (Mirth and Akam2002; Mirth2005; Tajiri et al.2010,2011; Kimura et al.2020), it is still unknown how individual cells continuously change their shape to form the final shape of the adult tarsus. In this paper, our results of long-term live imaging, in which tarsal morphogenesis during the pupal stage is continuously observed, are described. We found unexpected and dramatic shape changes in epithelial cells and the basement membrane, as well as interesting behavior of macrophage-like cells. The results presented here will greatly contribute to elucidating the mechanism of the final shape formation of the adult tarsus. Flies were raised on a standard cornmeal/agar/yeast medium at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. The fly strains used were the following:His2Av-mRFPIII.1andHis2Av-mRFPII.1(Pandey et al.2005),Jupiter-GFPG00147(Morin et al.2001),sGMCA3.1(Kiehart et al.2000),sqh-GFPC-42(Royou et al.2004),Ubi-GFP-CAAXZH-22A(Kondo and Hyashi2013),Ubi-TagRFP-T-CAAX, LanB1-GFPfTRG00681.sfGFP-TVPTBF(Sarov et al.2016), UAS-Apoliner(Bardet et al.2008), UAS-GFP.S65T, UAS-GFPnls, UAS-TagBFP9D, UAS-Kaede(Ando et al.2002),Ay-GAL4 (Ito et al.1997),Dll-GAL4em212(Gorfinkiel et al.1997),He-GAL4 (Zettervall et al.2004),neur-GAL4A101(Jhaveri et al.2000),srpHemo-GAL4 (Brückner et al.2004), andhsp70-FLP. Further details on fly strains are found in Flybase (http://flybase.org). Genotypes of flies used for each figure and movie are shown in TableS1. For live imaging after 12 h APF (i.e., Stage III onwards), the puparium was completely removed. The pupa covered only by the pupal cuticle was mounted with the ventral side down on the bottom of a glass-bottom dish. This allowed us to observe the tarsi of the first and second legs from their lateral sides since they are oriented laterally so that their lateral sides face toward the outside of the pupa. We essentially observed the tarsus of the first leg. A small amount of water or silicon oil (Olympus) was put between the glass-bottom and the pupa. Silicon grease (Shin-Etsu Silicone) was placed around the pupa, on which a cover glass was placed. In this preparation, we succeeded in keeping flies alive until the end of the pupal stage. Z stack images were acquired at regular time intervals. In Stage II (before 12 h APF), the puparium cannot be removed without affecting development due to the incomplete formation of the pupal cuticle or its tight association with the puparium. In addition, the tissue movement is very rapid. Therefore, the pupa without its puparium removed was set up as described above for live imaging, and we collected images of a singleXYplane corresponding to the longitudinal section every 2 min. All live imaging observations were performed using the inverted confocal microscope, FV3000 (Olympus) at room temperature (not strict but near 25 °C). Images were analyzed by ImageJ (https://fiji.sc/), Imaris (Oxford Instruments), and cellSens (Olympus). White pupae of flies carryinghsp70-FLP,Ay-GAL4, and UAS-GFP.S65Twere collected into a new culture vial and heat shocked by soaking the culture vial in a water bath incubator for 30 min at 37 °C. After heat shock, the flies were allowed to develop at 25 °C. Z stack images were obtained between 18 h APF and 19.5 h APF as described above. The number of protrusions in each cell was counted manually. Pupae carryingDll-GAL4em212and UAS-Kaedewere mounted as described above at 17 h APF. Prior to live imaging, the 405-nm laser was irradiated to cells at nearly constant intervals for 5 s. In all irradiations, green signals of Kaede were immediately photoconverted to red signals. Then, live imaging was started from 18 h APF as described above. For observation ofHe>GFPnls, pupal legs of flies carryingHe-GAL4 and UAS-GFPnlswere dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, it was fixed in PBS containing 4% Paraformaldehyde for 1.5 h in room temperature and washed in PBS containing 0.01% Saponin (PBSS). After that, they were stained in PBSS containing 0.25% 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (SIGMA) and 0.5~0.75% Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 3 h. Stained samples were washed in PBSS and mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Labs). Images were obtained by FV1000 (Olympus). Observations of srpHemo>GFPflies were carried out in the same way as other live imaging experiments. To observe tarsal development during the pupal stage in detail, we took advantage of long-term live imaging. How the final shape of the tarsus is formed through very dynamic changes at both tissue and cellular levels was successfully traced. Together with earlier observations, we divide the entire process into the following five stages for convenience (Fig.1). The overview of the final shape formation ofDrosophilaadult tarsus during the pupal stage. We divided the entire process into five stages based on the morphological changes at both tissue and cellular levels observed in long-term live imaging experiments. Representative photos or surface-rendered images (sGMCA signal) corresponding to several time points are shown on the left side. See also Supplemental MoviesS1,S3 Just after puparium formation (APF), the leg disc partially elongates and evaginates from the center, making each tarsal segment recognizable morphologically. This process has been reported to be controlled by cell shape changes, cell rearrangements, and the interaction between the disc epithelium and peripodial epithelium (Condic et al.1991; Proag et al.2019). As this process has been described in detail previously, we do not get into it in this paper. After the eversion of the leg disc, the elongation of the tarsus further proceeds by unfolding of the morphologically distinctive tarsal segments. By 15 h APF, the tarsus fully elongates, with the tarsal segments no longer visible morphologically, forming a bloated tube with a large lumen diameter. Both the length and diameter of the tarsus reach their maxima. The latter is more than three times the diameter of the adult tarsus (Fig.S1B). The pupal cuticle is formed at least by the end of this stage. The tarsus decreases its diameter dramatically (Fig.S1B). During this change, indentations between tarsal segments reappear and deepen, making segmental structures visible again. Moreover, some bristles start to sprout by the end of this stage. The name of this stage comes from an interesting structure of the epithelial cells seen in this stage, which we named the Parthenon-like structure. Its details are described later. The indentation between tarsal segments deepens further, and the joint formation between tarsal segments proceeds. Bristles fully elongate, and their formation is nearly completed. Furthermore, the formation of pretarsal structures, such as claws and pulvilli occurs mainly in this stage. By about 50 h APF, the formation of the external shapes of the adult leg is almost complete. Seen from the outside, the shape of the leg hardly changes during this stage. However, we discovered that the thickness of the epithelial cell layer continues to reduce gradually. Thus, we separated this stage from Stage IV as an independent stage. Hereafter, we describe the details of cell dynamics in each of the above stages except Stage I. In Stage II, the tarsus elongates to its maximum length along the proximodistal direction to form a broad and straight tubular structure. Live imaging was performed without removing the puparium in Stage II since it is difficult to remove the puparium without causing developmental defects before 12 h APF. In this condition, the depth of the focus at which clear images could be obtained was limited. In addition to this limitation, the tissue elongates so quickly that taking images as a Z series was also difficult. Accordingly, we acquired images of a singleXYplane corresponding to the longitudinal section every 2 min. We used flies expressing GFP-CAAX (labeling the plasma membrane) and His2Av-mRFP (labeling the nuclei). At the beginning of the live imaging, 7 h APF, the everted tarsus was slightly elongated but the folding of each tarsal segment was still visible (Fig.S2A, Supplemental MovieS2). From around 9 h APF, the elongation of the tarsus was accelerated with the rapid unfolding of each tarsal segment. By 11 h APF, the folding disappeared almost completely, and the tarsus had become a bloated, straight epithelial tube (Fig.S2B–E). During this process, epithelial cells initially long in the apicobasal direction became cuboidal in shape. Interestingly, a cluster of large cells was observed coming from the proximal side and spreading distally in the lumen of the elongating tarsus (Fig.S2B–E, Supplemental MovieS2). After this stage onwards, they were always observed in the tarsus (see below). Since these large cells expressed hemocyte-specific GAL4, such asHe-GAL4 orsrpHemo-GAL4, they appeared to be hemocytes (Fig.S3), presumably macrophage-like cells according to their morphology and behavior (see below). From this stage onwards, the pupa becomes resilient to having its puparium removed and can develop into the adult after the complete removal of the puparium. The developing pupa without the puparium is only covered by the transparent pupal cuticle, which allows us to acquire clear images at relatively deeper focuses. Additionally, from Stage III onwards, changes in overall shape are no longer as rapid as in Stage II. Accordingly, we could collect Z series images at each time point during long-term live imaging experiments from Stage III (Supplemental MovieS1,S3). This long-term live imaging experiment allowed us to analyze detailed cellular behaviors. As mentioned above, the overall diameter of the tarsus decreases dramatically in Stage III. We observed that surprisingly dynamic changes in cell morphology occur inside during this process. Around 18 h APF, epithelial cells deformed their shapes and temporarily formed an interesting structure. We named it the Parthenon-like structure because it reminded us of the Parthenon, an ancient Greek ruin. Details of the Parthenon-like structure and associated cellular dynamics are described in the following three subsections. Firstly, flies expressing His2Av-mRFP (labeling the nuclei) and sGMCA (labeling actin) were observed, and Z series images were obtained every 15 min (Fig.2, Supplemental MoviesS1,S3). By reconstructing a 3D structure using a part of these images obtained at 18 h APF, we found a very curious architecture of the epithelial cell layer (Fig.3A). Nuclei and most volumes of sGMCA signals were aligned as a monolayer on the apical (outer) side. At the basal (inner) side, sGMCA signals spread planarly, creating a thin layer. Between these two layers, pillar-like sGMCA signals were seen connecting them. There appeared to be open spaces or cavities between the pillars. Since sGMCA labels actin, it could be possible that epithelial cells are tightly lined up without space between them as usual and that it is the cytoskeleton forming the curious structure. However, similar structures were also observed in flies expressing plain GFP (labeling cytosol) under the control ofDistal-less(Dll)-GAL4 (Dll>GFP) (Fig.S4A) and GFP-CAAX (labeling cell membrane) (see Fig.3D–F).Thus, we concluded that epithelial cells themselves form this remarkable structure by deformation; that is, epithelial cells tightly align most of their cell body containing nuclei at the apical side, protrude cytoplasm as a pillar-like process in a basal direction, and then spread at the basal side, making cavities within the epithelial cell layer. As mentioned above, we named this structure the Parthenon-like structure after the ancient Greek ruin. We also observed the Parthenon-like structure in flies expressing Jupiter-GFP (labeling microtubule) and Sqh-GFP (labeling Myo II) (Fig.S4B, C). Thus, cytoskeletal molecules, such as actin, microtubule, and Myo II, appear to be assembled in cables inside the pillars. Within the Parthenon-like structure, several clusters of cells whose cell bodies and nuclei fell into cavities were observed (surrounded by a dashed line in Fig.3A). The time-lapse observations until later stages and labeling of sensory cells by TagBFP driven byneuralized(neur)-GAL4, which is specifically expressed in the sensory cells, indicate that these cells are sensory organ cells (Fig.S4D–D”). Interestingly, we found that macrophage-like cells frequently existed and were actively moving around in the cavities between pillars (arrow in Fig.3A). Their detailed behavior is described later.

Scale bar inD, 5 μm forD–F To reveal whether the pillar-like structures are contributed by all the epidermal cells or only a part of them, we carried out the mosaic analysis by the flip-out technique using flies havinghsp70-FLP, UAS-GFP, andAy-GAL4 (Golic and Lindquist1989; Ito et al.1997), in which small patches of epithelial cells were labeled by GFP (Fig.3B). The reconstructed image of the representative cluster of four epithelial cells is shown in Fig.3B’ and Supplemental MovieS4. The leftmost cell had one protrusion while the next one on the right had two. Moreover, the right protrusion of the second cell looked to be making a bundle with a protrusion from the adjacent third cell on the right of the second cell (open arrow in Fig.3B’, Supplemental MovieS4). When counting how many protrusions each cell extended, we found that, in 18 h APF, all epithelial cells extended one or two protrusions (Fig.3C; only one protrusion in about two-thirds of the epithelial cells and two in about one-third). These results indicate that all epithelial cells contribute to the pillars of the Parthenon-like structure and that each pillar is made up of protrusions derived from multiple adjacent cells. As shown above, the shape of epithelial cells was cuboidal at the end of Stage II (Fig.S2E, Supplemental MovieS2). These cuboidal epithelial cells started to form rapidly the Parthenon-like structure with the onset of Stage III (Fig.2A’, B’). The thickness of the epithelial cell layer rapidly increased with the elongation of the pillars of the Parthenon-like structure (Fig.S1C). Once the epithelial thickness reached its maximum, the Parthenon-like structure turned to be resolved rapidly by the shortening of the pillars and disappearance of the cavities (Fig.2C’, D’), resulting in the decrease of the epithelial thickness (Fig.S1C). During the above process, the lumen diameter and overall diameter of the tarsus also reduced dramatically (Fig.S1B), implying a close relationship between the formation/disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure and the reduction of the tarsus diameter. The disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure progressed faster in the future joint region than in the inter-joint region, resulting in the invagination of the apical surface (see arrowheads in Supplemental MovieS3). This allowed the morphological distinction of tarsal segments again. To reveal details in the Parthenon-like structure formation, Z stack images were obtained every 5 min using flies expressing GFP-CAAX and His2Av-mRFP (Fig.3D–F, Supplemental MovieS5). Before the formation of the Parthenon-like structure initiated, cuboidal epithelial cells were aligned as a monolayer (Fig.3D). In around 16 h APF, at the very beginning of the formation of the Parthenon-like structure, a part of the cytoplasm of epithelial cells protruded basally, while connections between neighboring cells at the basal surface looked to be maintained, resulting in the formation of triangular-shaped cavities (Fig.3E, F, asterisks). In addition, relatively strong signals of GFP-CAAX were observed in the area where the pillars were being formed (Fig.3D. E arrowheads). The protrusions then elongated basally to form the pillars (Fig.3F). As the lumen diameter dramatically reduced during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure, we thought that some structural changes in the basal part of the Parthenon-like structure must occur during this process. Thus, we focused on the structure and behavior of the basal surface of epithelial cells. To know its detailed structure, we observed the focal planes including only the basal surface of GFP-expressing epithelial cells (the floor of the Parthenon-like structure) inDll>GFPflies (Fig.4A–C’). Surprisingly, in 16.5 h APF, the basal surface of epithelial cells showed a mesh-like pattern and had many holes (Fig.4B’). The live imaging showed these holes rapidly shrank and almost disappeared within 2 h, as the overall diameter of the tarsus reduced (Fig4B’, C’, Supplemental MovieS6). To reveal how each epithelial cell comprises the basal meshwork, we carefully analyzed clusters of epithelial cells expressing GFP inAy>GFPflies. Observation of 3D-reconstructed images of clusters showed that filopodia-like thin protrusions were elongated from the roots of the pillars (Fig.4D, Supplemental MovieS7). According to this observation, we hypothesized that such filopodia-like protrusions connect to each other to form the basal meshwork as shown in the illustration in Fig.4E.

To investigate the structure of the basement membrane during the shrinkage of the basal meshwork of epithelial cells, we examined the basement membrane structure using flies expressing Laminin B1-GFP (LanB1-GFP) and RFP-CAAX (Fig.4F–H, Supplemental MovieS8). LanB1 is a major component of the basement membrane. LanB1-GFP signals coincided with the basal surface of epithelial cells, as shown by the comparison between LanB1-GFP and RFP-CAAX signals (Fig.4F–F”). The basement membrane also showed the mesh-like structure at the initiation of the Parthenon-like structure formation (Fig.4G). The meshwork of LanB1-GFP signals also shrank, becoming uniform and membranous signals, as is generally seen (Fig.4H). These observations indicate that the basement membrane structure also changed dramatically during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure. In addition to the meshwork to membranous change in the basal surface of the Parthenon-like structure, we found another interesting behavior of it. As shown in Fig.5A, the basal surface of epithelial cells was winding along the proximodistal axis immediately after the Parthenon-like structure started to form, possibly because the progression of the pillar elongation varies from place to place along the proximodistal axis. However, it progressively flattened along with the shrinkage of the basal meshwork (Fig.5B, C). In 19.5 h APF, the basal surface of epithelial cells was very straight and taut (Fig.5D). These observations imply increasing tension on the basal surface in the proximodistal direction. We further obtained interesting data related to the proximodistal tension by utilizing the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede, which converts the color from green to red in response to UV irradiation (Ando et al.2002). We irradiated epithelial cells positioned at roughly regular intervals with UV light and then, observed the tarsus by live imaging (Fig.5E–G”, Supplemental MovieS9). Since the tarsus is a three-dimensional structure, and epithelial cells are arranged three-dimensionally, it was difficult to irradiate only one target cell. Instead, several neighboring cells were labeled simultaneously in each of the UV-irradiated loci. In 18 h APF, pillars of the Parthenon-like structure appeared to be tilted relative to the apicobasal axis, with the basal side more distal than the apical side (Fig.5E–E”). Interestingly, live imaging showed that the basal side then moved significantly toward the proximal direction (Fig.5F–F”, Supplemental MovieS9). By 24 h APF, the tilting direction of the pillars was reversed, so that the basal side was more proximal than the apical side (Fig.5G–G”). These observations also imply that there is a tension that pulls the basal part of the Parthenon-like structure proximally.

The details of the pulvilli formation have been described previously by Kimura et al. (2020). From this stage onwards, the difference between the dorsal and ventral sides of the tarsus became apparent. The thickness of the epithelial cell layer became much thinner on the ventral side than on the dorsal side (Fig.S1C). The ventral epithelial cell layer was straight, whereas the dorsal epithelial cell layer was somewhat arched (Fig.6A–B’). Furthermore, the formation of the ball-and-socket structure of the joint was started on the dorsal side but not on the ventral side (Fig.6B–C’). On the dorsal side, invagination of the joint region became deepened with a greater reduction of the luminal diameter at the joint region than in the inter-joint region, making a deep cleft between neighboring tarsal segments (Fig.6A, A’, Supplemental MovieS3). After the cleft reached its deepest at around 40 h APF, the bottom of the cleft moved proximally (Fig.6B, B’, Supplemental MovieS3,S10), and then, the ball-and-socket structure formation of the joint proceeded during the early Stage V (Fig.6C’, D’, Supplemental MovieS3,S10). This process has previously been described in detail by Tajiri et al. (2010). The arched dorsal epithelial cell layer seemed to result from the deep invagination at the joint region. In Stage IV, the overall diameter of each segment was slightly reduced but not so much as in Stage III (Fig.S1B).

Dashed rectangles inA, B, C,Dare magnified inA’,B’,C’,D’, respectively. By the end of Stage IV (A–B’), the external shape formation, such as elongation of bristles, claws, and pulvilli are almost complete. The bottom of the invaginated joint moved proximally, and then, the ball-and-socket structure formation progressed in Stage V. The morphological difference between the dorsal and ventral epithelium became apparent (double arrows and open double arrows inB’,C’,D’). In Stage V (C–D’), the epithelial layer decreased its thickness without hardly changing the outline of segments. See also Supplemental MovieS10. Dorsal is to the top and distal to the right in all figures. Scale bars inA, 50 μm forA, B, C,D, inA’, 20 μm forA’,B’,C’,D’ Even after the completion of the external shape by the end of Stage IV, changes in the epithelial cell layer continued inside. The epithelial cell layer decreased its thickness without hardly changing the outline of segments. During this process, the basal surface of the epithelial cell layer was getting closer to the apical surface (Fig.6C–D’, Supplemental MovieS10). As shown above, we observed that macrophage-like cells were getting into the lumen of the expanding tarsus from the proximal end in Stage II (see Fig.S2, Supplemental MovieS2) and resided in the cavity of the Parthenon-like structure, where they were actively moving around, in Stage III (see Fig.3and Supplemental MovieS3). Fascinatingly, by obtaining Z stack images every 22 s, we succeeded in capturing the moment when a macrophage-like cell in the Parthenon-like structure phagocytoses an epithelial cell (Fig.7A–E, Supplemental MovieS11). A macrophage-like cell (arrow in Fig.7A–E) in the cavity of the Parthenon-like structure extended filopodia apically and phagocytosed an epithelial cell whose cell body containing the nucleus was extruded basally (arrowheads in Fig.7A–E). To confirm that cells phagocytosed by macrophage-like cells were apoptotic cells, we observed the caspase activity in epithelial cells by expressing Apoliner under the control ofDll-GAL4 (Dll>Apoliner). Apoliner is a caspase activity reporter, in which mRFP with a transmembrane domain is connected to EGFP with nuclear localization signal (NLS-EGFP) by a linker containing the target site cleaved by caspases. Without caspase activity, both mRFP and EGFP are colocalized on the cell membrane, while NLS-EGFP is released from the membrane-attached mRFP and gets into the nucleus in response to caspase activity (Bardet et al.2008). Since we usedDll-GAL4 to drive Apoliner expression, it was expressed only in epithelial cells but not in macrophage-like cells. However, we could see a macrophage-like cell as a cluster of relatively large dots of mRFP signals (Fig.7H–N) probably due to the accumulation of mRFP derived from engulfed epithelial cells, as mentioned in the original report (Bardet et al.2008). This helped us to find macrophage-like cells inDll>Apolinerflies. Through live imaging, we observed that one epithelial cell, which initially located its cell body at the apical side without the nuclear EGFP signal, began to show the EGFP signal in its nucleus (Fig.7F, G), and then, its cell body migrated in a basal direction (Fig.7H), finally reaching a macrophage-like cell detected as a cluster of mRFP signals (Fig.7H, see also Supplemental MovieS12). Macrophage-like cells with multiple EGFP signals were often observed (Fig.7I, I’). These signals appeared to reflect EGFP signals in nuclei of engulfed epithelial cells. In addition, we also successively observed a macrophage-like cell passing through the basal surface of the Parthenon-like structure (Fig.7J–N, Supplemental MovieS13). Taken together, it appears that macrophage-like cells move in and out of the cavities of the Parthenon-like structure, and when entering the cavity, they phagocytose epithelial cells initiating apoptosis.

Scale bars inA, 5 μm forA–E, inF, 10 μm forF–I’, inJ, 10 μm forJ–N Taking advantage of long-term live imaging, we could reveal nearly the whole shaping process of the adult tarsus during the pupal stage inDrosophila. Changes in the shape of cells and the tissue as a composite of cells were more dramatic and complex than previously thought. Epithelial cells change their shape from columnar to cuboidal during the elongation of the tarsus in Stage II (see Fig.S2and Supplemental MovieS2). Then, the cuboidal epithelial cells further change their shape dramatically to form the unexpected structure, the Parthenon-like structure, in Stage III (see Fig.3and Supplemental MovieS5). The Parthenon-like structure is a transient structure, and the rapid reduction in the tarsal diameter occurs during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure (see Fig.S1B and Supplemental MovieS3). After the tarsal diameter becomes that of the adult leg at the end of Stage III, the thickness of the epithelial cell layer continues to reduce in Stage IV and Stage V (see Fig.S1C, Fig.6and Supplemental MovieS10). Especially in Stage V, although the external shape is completed, the thinning of the epithelial cell layer further continues internally. In addition, we could also document the behavior of macrophage-like cells (see Fig.7and Supplemental MovieS11-13). The possible mechanisms and roles of these cellular dynamics are discussed below. In Stage II, the everted tarsus fully elongates to its maximum length. The invasion of macrophage-like cells from proximal to distal during the tarsal elongation (see Fig.S2, Supplemental MovieS2) makes us imagine the influx of hemolymph into the tarsus. It may be possible that the influx of hemolymph contributes to the tarsal elongation by raising inner pressure. Previously, it has been proposed that the tarsal elongation is a result of hydrostatic pressure, according to the fact that the tarsal elongation can be caused by pressing on the abdomen of the prepupa (Fristrom and Fristrom1993). Therefore, hydrostatic pressure may be one of the primary forces driving the tarsal elongation in Stage II. Interestingly, it has been shown that the elongation of the horn during the pupal stage in the beetle is caused by hydrostatic pressure (Matsuda et al.2017). Thus, this may be one of the fundamental mechanisms for the rapid elongation of long, rod-like appendages. Interestingly, it has been reported that the degradation of several basement membrane proteins in Stage I is important for the elongation and cell shape changes (Diaz-de-la-Loza et al.2018). Therefore, the combination of the release of epithelial cells from the constraining force provided by the basement membrane and the increase in hydrostatic pressure may be important. Epithelial cells comprising the Parthenon-like structure apically align the most of their cell body containing the nuclei, elongate the cytoplasmic process in a basal direction, and connect with each other at the basal end to form a thin layer, making the cavity in the epithelial cell layer (see Fig.3). Each epithelial cell protrudes one or two processes, and the processes of neighboring cells bundle together to form the pillar. This is reminiscent of neurons extending axons and forming axon bundles. Thus, it might be possible that just as neurons extend axons and then connect with other cells, epithelial cells protrude processes first and then form the basal connection. When observing the initial step of the Parthenon-like structure formation, however, we found that the basal connection between epithelial cells already formed in the very beginning (see Fig.3D–F). This may indicate that epithelial cells are basally connected before initiating the Parthenon-like structure formation and protrude processes while maintaining the connection, unlike neurons. Since actin, microtubule, and Myo II were abundantly found in the pillars of the Parthenon-like structure (see Fig.S4), cytoskeletal regulation may actively contribute to the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure by controlling elongation and retraction of the pillars. As for the formation of the Parthenon-like structure, another but not exclusive idea is the contribution of the basement membrane. Evidence that the basement membrane actively contributes to tissue shape has been accumulating recently (reviewed in Morrissey and Sherwood2015; Pastor-Pareja2020; Töpfer2023). In the case of our observation on the tarsal development, both the basal surface of epithelial cells and the basement membrane initially showed a mesh-like pattern, and they shrank to form the membranous structure without holes during the reduction of the luminal diameter (see Fig.4). This may indicate that changes in the composition of the basement membrane produce a force to pull epithelial cells toward the basal side and contribute to the elongation of the pillars, i.e., the formation of the Parthenon-like structure. Before Stage II, the tarsal joints of the adult leg are prefigured by the folding of the epithelium. Interestingly, our observation showed that the epithelial folding is resolved by the end of Stage II and reappears during Stage III along with the disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure. This raises the question of how the identity of the joint regions is maintained. Notch signaling and its target genes such asAP-2anddysfusionare required for both the early folding and the later refolding. Accordingly, the expression of Notch ligands or its target genes in the joint regions is detected prior to the early folding as well as prior to the later refolding (de Celis et al.1998; Kerber et al.2001; Córdoba and Estella2014; Tajiri et al.2011). These insights are consistent with a model in which continuous Notch signaling in the joint regions, maintained by sustained expression of the ligands, regulates both the early folding and the later refolding. Meanwhile, considering the extensive cell dynamics during the long interval between the two phases of folding, the possibility that Notch activity is remodeled or refined during the interval cannot be excluded. The present study will be the basis for unraveling how cell identities are maintained in the face of dynamic cell behaviors. In Stage II, macrophage-like cells were observed entering the lumen of the elongating tarsus from the proximal side and spreading distally (see Fig.S2, Supplemental MovieS2). This observation may indicate that macrophage-like cells that originate outside the leg come with the hemolymph flow. After entering the tarsal lumen, macrophage-like cells continued to reside and were actively moving around in the lumen (see Supplemental MovieS3). When the Parthenon-like structure is formed, they intruded into and moved around in the cavity (see Fig.7, Supplemental MovieS13). Within the cavity, they phagocytosed epithelial cells with caspase activity (see Fig.7A–I’). According to these observations, macrophage-like cells might be involved in controlling cell number by phagocytosing excess cells. Making the cavity within the epithelial cell layer by forming the Parthenon-like structure might help macrophage-like cells engulf epithelial cells. Previously, it has been reported that the depletion of hemocytes by specifically inducing cell death results in severe morphological defects, such as truncation in legs (Arefin et al.2015). Macrophage-like cells may also play another role in tarsal morphogenesis besides the trimming of excess cells. The Parthenon-like structure does not seem to be a special structure observed only in the tarsus. We found it also in other leg segments (Fig.S5A). Moreover, a similar structure could be observed in the head region and the notum region (Fig.S5B-E). In the wing, epithelial cells in the pupal stage are known to form similar shapes with epithelial cells in the Parthenon-like structure, in which cell bodies are aligned apically and protrude the thin process basally, although the structure of the basal side seems to be different from the Parthenon-like structure (Waddington1940; Fristrom et al.1993; Sun et al.2021; Tran et al.2024). Furthermore, in the pupal wing of lepidopteran insects, epithelial cells with similar protrusion and hemocytes moving around between them have been reported (Nardi and Magee-Adams1986; Kodama et al.1995; Ohno and Otaki2015; McDougal et al.2021). Other than the wing, structures resembling the Parthenon-like structure have also been found in the prepupal abdominal epidermis and developing pupal antennae of Lepidoptera (Delhanty and Locke1989; Ando et al.2011). Therefore, the transient formation of the Parthenon-like structure appears to be one of the essential processes of final shape formation by epithelial cells at least in insects. Further study on the mechanism of the transient formation of the Parthenon-like structure and its role in morphogenesis will help to better understand the mechanisms of final shape formation.

The team used time-lapse microscopy to image the live cells of fruit flies and found a new structure, which forms and disappears in the final stages of a common fruit fly’s development, that appears to help guide a section of the fly’s leg into its final shape. The findings could lead to better understanding the mechanisms determining an insect body’s shape, as well as providing insight into processes shaping the bodies of other organisms.
In the current study, the research team set out to clarify how certain cells determine an organism’s final shape, using fruit fly leg development as a model. By imaging the live cells of the common fruit flyDrosophila melanogasterover several days to analyze changes in the cells during the last stages of development, the researchers found a transient structure in the fly’s leg involved in determining the limb’s final shape. They named this formation the “Parthenon-like structure” because of a resemblance to the ancient Greek ruin.
“Cells change their shape more dramatically than ever thought during the final shape formation process,” said co-author Tetsuya Kojima, associate professor in the Department of Integrated Biosciences at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Frontier Sciences. “Especially in the case of the fruit fly’s leg, cells transiently form the fascinating structure. Because the Parthenon-like structure is seen in tissues other than the leg and seems to appear in other insects, its transient formation may be a fundamental process that forms the final shape of the insect’s body.”
According to the researchers, the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination — how cells figure out which genes to express and contribute to the organism’s developed form — are conserved among closely related species. However, how these cells contribute to the form’s shape has remained elusive.
“Since shapes can differ dramatically between closely related species that are expected to share the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination, differences in final shape formation processes should greatly contribute to making the shape differences,” said co-author Reiko Tajiri, a researcher at the University of Tokyo at the time of the study and currently associate professor at Chiba University in Japan. “Understanding the mechanisms of final shape formation is of great importance to understanding the mechanisms of formation and diversification of organisms’ shapes.”
To understand the mechanisms of final shape formation, the researchers used an inverted confocal microscope — which images the specimens from underneath and allows for clearer visuals — to image the developing legs of fruit flies over several days. They specifically focused on the tarsus, or the segment of leg farthest from an insect’s body. The tarsus can appear flat and wide in male diving beetles or long and slender in mosquitoes. The tarsus also contains its own segments, which differ significantly across species.
“This diversity in morphology (form and structure) makes the insect tarsus a good model for studying the mechanisms of final shape formation and its diversification,” Kojima said. “In this study, we found unexpected and dramatic shape changes in epithelial cells — cells that line the surface of structures — and the basement membrane, which give rise to the structures that differentiate into the tarsal segments. We also saw interesting behavior of macrophage-like cells, which typically help clean up waste cells.”
Capturing nearly the whole shaping process of the adult tarsus during the fly’s pupal stage, the researchers observed that the epithelial cells changed from a column shape to be more cubelike. They said the cells further changed to “dramatically” form the unexpected, transient Parthenon-like structure. As that structure forms and then disappears, the tarsus’s diameter reduces rapidly. Following the reduction in diameter, the layer of epithelial cells thinned out.
“Our results contribute to elucidating the mechanism for the final shape formation of the adult tarsus,” Kojima said, noting that the team is now studying the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure in more detail to better understand how it contributes to making the final leg shape.

Fresh wind blows from historical supernova,"...but your activity and behavior on this site made us think that you are a bot. Note:A number of things could be going on here.

Two white dwarf stars collided, creating a temporary “guest star,” now labeled supernova (SN) 1181, which was recorded in historical documents in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. However, after the star dimmed, its location and structure remained a mystery until a team pinpointed its location in 2021. Now, through computer modeling and observational analysis, researchers have recreated the structure of the remnant white dwarf, a rare occurrence, explaining its double shock formation. They also discovered that high-speed stellar winds may have started blowing from its surface within just the past 20-30 years. This finding improves our understanding of the diversity of supernova explosions, and highlights the benefits of interdisciplinary research, combining history with modern astronomy to enable new discoveries about our galaxy.
It is the year 1181 and in Japan the Genpei War (1180-85) has recently begun. It will lead to a shift in political power from aristocratic families to the new military-based shogunate, which will establish itself in the coastal city of Kamakura near modern-day Tokyo. A record of this tumultuous period was compiled in a diary format in the Azuma Kagami. It chronicled not only people’s lives and key events (with varying accuracy), but other daily observations, including the appearance of a new star.
“There are many accounts of this temporary guest star in historical records from Japan, China and Korea. At its peak, the star’s brightness was comparable to Saturn’s. It remained visible to the naked eye for about 180 days, until it gradually dimmed out of sight. The remnant of the SN 1181 explosion is now very old, so it is dark and difficult to find,” explained lead author Takatoshi Ko, a doctoral student from the Department of Astronomy at the University of Tokyo.
The remnant of this guest star, labeled supernova remnant (SNR) 1181, was found to have been created when two extremely dense, Earth-sized stars, called white dwarfs, collided. This created a rare type of supernova, called a Type Iax supernova, which left behind a single, bright and fast-rotating white dwarf. Aided by observations on its position noted in the historical document, modern astrophysicists finally pinpointed its location in 2021 in a nebula towards the constellation Cassiopeia.
Due to its rare nature and location within our galaxy, SNR 1181 has been the subject of much observational research. This suggested that SNR 1181 is made up of two shock regions, an outer region and an inner one. In this new study, the research group analyzed the latest X-ray data to construct a theoretical computer model to explain these observations, and which has recreated the previously unexplained structure of this supernova remnant.
The main challenge was that according to conventional understanding, when two white dwarfs collide like this, they should explode and disappear. However, this merger left behind a white dwarf. The spinning white dwarf was expected to create a stellar wind (a fast-flowing stream of particles) immediately after its formation. However, what the researchers found was something else.
“If the wind had started blowing immediately after SNR 1181’s formation, we couldn’t reproduce the observed size of the inner shock region,” said Ko. “However, by treating the wind’s onset time as variable, we succeeded in explaining all of the observed features of SNR 1181 accurately and unraveling the mysterious properties of this high-speed wind. We were also able to simultaneously track the time evolution of each shock region, using numerical calculations.”
The team was very surprised to find that according to their calculations, the wind may have started blowing only very recently, within the past 20-30 years. They suggest this may indicate that the white dwarf has started to burn again, possibly due to some of the matter thrown out by the explosion witnessed in 1181 falling back to its surface, increasing its density and temperature over a threshold to restart burning.
To validate their computer model, the team is now preparing to further observe SNR 1181 using the Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope based in central New Mexico state in the U.S., and the 8.2 meter-class Subaru Telescope in the U.S. state of Hawaii.
“The ability to determine the age of supernova remnants or the brightness at the time of their explosion through archaeological perspectives is a rare and invaluable asset to modern astronomy,” said Ko. “Such interdisciplinary research is both exciting and highlights the immense potential for combining diverse fields to uncover new dimensions of astronomical phenomena.”

This CO2reduction technology corresponds to the CO2emitted during concrete production. When considering the marketability of these technologies, especially for newly developed products in the carbon market, it is essential to quantify the amount of CO2fixed as inorganic carbonate. Additionally, as a representative test specimen for concrete containing aggregate, aφ100 × 200 mm cylinder specimen is conventionally used for physical property evaluation. To evaluate the amount of CO2fixed in one batch of concrete, a mass far from that of the conventional chemical analysis sample may need to be analyzed. Therefore, in this study, we investigated a pulverization process for concrete analytical materials. We also propose a new analytical apparatus that can be used to measure large cylinder specimens. Experimental results showed that the newly developed analyzer, equipped with a mass balance and CO2and H2O gas analyzer for large cylinders, exhibited excellent analytical variability and measurement speed performance. It was also inferred that the homogenization process is necessary to grind the entire cylindrical concrete specimen into a fine powder and homogenize it to improve the representativeness of the concrete.

Already have an account? Sign inhere","A new device can measure carbon dioxide captured in concrete more simply and in a third of the time of current methods. Researchers at the University of Tokyo worked with engineers in industry to create the boxlike device called the concrete thermal gravimetry and gas analyzer. The device heats concrete samples to almost 1,000 degrees Celsius, causing the CO2within to be released so it can be measured. Compared to the current technique, which involves a time-consuming and complicated process of crushing concrete samples into powder for sampling, this new method is simpler, more accurate and user-friendly. The researchers hope it will contribute to CO2trading in the future, as the concrete and cement industry work towards offsetting their emissions as part of global targets to manage greenhouse gases.
Concrete is everywhere. We live in it, walk on it, even make movies and write songs about it. Ubiquitous in modern life and even way back in ancient Rome, this sturdy and durable material is a staple for construction projects around the world. But, it is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the process of making concrete and one of its key ingredients, cement, emits a considerable amount of greenhouse gases. It is estimated that 5-8% of all CO2emissions from human activities to date are from cement production alone. However, concrete can now be used to store CO2, through methods of carbon capture, utilization and storage.
Achieving “net zero,” whereby the amount of CO2taken out of the atmosphere is equal to the amount released, has become a cornerstone of international policies to tackle global warming. But to do this, we need to know what creates greenhouse gases and at what levels, and how much can be removed through different techniques.
Until now, finding out how much CO2has been successfully captured in concrete was an extensive process. A cylinder block, about 10 centimeters in diameter and 20 cm high, would be taken and crushed in a way that it couldn’t react with the air (which would affect the results). Then a complicated and long process followed to turn it into a fine, uniform powder from which a small sample was taken for chemical analysis.
A new device, developed by researchers at the University of Tokyo with engineers in industry, can skip this time-consuming process. “We developed a new machine which can measure how much CO2is fixed in concrete or cementitious material without having to crush it,” said Professor Ippei Maruyama from the Department of Architecture at the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Engineering. “Until now, there wasn’t a simple method to measure the amount of CO2fixed in concrete, but with this device, we can shorten the time it takes to measure CO2and increase the accuracy of the measurement.”
A specimen block is placed inside the device and then heated to 980 degrees Celsius. As the block heats up, gases including CO2are released from the block, which can then be measured. This new process takes about one-third of the time of current methods, limiting the time the concrete can react with the air. Results showed that an accurate measurement could be taken even when CO2was not uniformly distributed within the block.
Researchers at the University of Tokyo envisioned the concept and parts required for the device, while engineers at Rigaku Corp. then developed it. It was then verified by researchers at the University of Tokyo and Taiheiyo Consultants Co., Ltd.
“This device requires a suitably large space and special safety considerations, so for now, there are some limitations to its application,” said Maruyama. “However, after further tests, we hope to make this device commercially available, so that it can contribute to sound emissions trading in the concrete sector and support global efforts to reach carbon neutrality.”

Background:There is limited evidence regarding the association between consumption of highly processed foods (HPFs) and overall diet quality in children and adolescents from Asian countries. Objective:This study aimed to examine the association between HPF consumption and overall diet quality in Japanese children and adolescents. Design:A cross-sectional analysis was conducted based on 8-day dietary record data collected from volunteers in 32 of 47 prefectures throughout Japan in 2016 to 2020. Foods were categorized into 1 of 4 processing levels using the framework developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Food classification was performed under a low-estimate scenario (classifying mixed dishes consumed outside the home after disaggregation into ingredients) and high-estimate scenario (classifying them into HPFs without food disaggregation). Participants/setting:A total of 1318 Japanese children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years participated in the study. Main outcome measures:Diet quality was assessed using the Healthy Eating Index-2020 and Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3. Statistical analysis:Multiple regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and anthropometric characteristics and the survey cycle were used to examine the association between tertiles of the energy contribution of HPFs and diet quality. Results:The mean energy contribution of HPFs was 27.3% and 44.3% in the low- and high-estimate scenarios, respectively. The top contributors to total energy intake from HPFs were confectioneries in the low-estimate scenario and cereals and starchy foods in the high-estimate scenario. Irrespective of the scenarios, participants in higher tertiles of energy contribution of HPFs had lower total scores for Healthy Eating Index-2020 and Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 (P for trend < .0001). Conclusions:HPFs accounted for more than one-quarter of the energy intake of Japanese children and adolescents surveyed, and higher consumption of HPFs was associated with lower diet quality. Therefore, reducing HPF consumption may increase overall diet quality among Japanese children and adolescents. Further research is needed to explore the causal nature of this association.

Highly processed foods (HPFs) accounted for over one-fourth of the total energy intake amongst youths. Consumption was negatively associated with the intake of healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables and pulses, and positively associated with the consumption of confectioneries.
It's common knowledge that poor-quality diets are considered major risk factors for many health issues and even noncommunicable diseases such as Type 2 diabetes. Therefore, researchers seek to understand factors related to diet quality as a way to improve people’s health. Research on HPFs has been rapidly increasing, highlighting their potential impact on public health. However, few studies have been conducted in Japan, with none focusing on children and adolescents, due to challenges in assessing them.
“Our previous research on HPF consumption in adults in Japan found that higher consumption was negatively associated with diet quality. This significant finding prompted us to investigate whether similar associations exist in younger generations,” said Assistant Professor Nana Shinozaki from the School of Public Health. “My team and I ran a cross-sectional study, one where many people are assessed in a short space of time rather than fewer people over a long period of time, to understand the association between HPF consumption and overall diet quality among Japanese children and adolescents. We found that higher HPF consumption is associated with poorer diet quality in 1,318 participants aged 3-17 years.”
This probably doesn’t come as a surprise to many, but it’s important to note that this is the first time hard data has been put to this specific demographic, and that fact might aid in improving public health. One of the difficulties in research on diets is that so many of the issues lack precise definitions. For this reason, Shinozaki and her team picked an existing dietary classification framework developed by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNCCH) in the U.S. to classify the food that participants consumed, and the Healthy Eating Index-2020 and the Nutrient-Rich Food Index 9.3 to evaluate the quality of their diets. Under the UNCCH classification, HPFs are defined as “multi-ingredient, industrially formulated mixtures processed to the extent that they are no longer recognizable as their original plant/animal source.”
“The biggest challenge was collecting detailed dietary data, which are essential to identify which foods are HPFs, on eight days over the course of a year from a large sample of about 1,300 individuals,” said Shinozaki. “This process of assessment by researchers, and assessments by participants or parents, was highly burdensome for both participants and investigators due to the need for accurate and consistent recording of dietary intake. Our research could not have been accomplished without the support of research dietitians throughout Japan, who played a crucial role in supporting participants and collecting data.”
What might surprise some readers is that the cliché of Japan’s national diet being the model of healthy eating is a little inaccurate and out of date.
“Professor Kentaro Murakami (of the University of Tokyo) recently found that in a nationally representative sample of Japanese adults, the mean total score of the Healthy Eating Index-2015, a widely accepted diet quality index, was similar to that of average Americans. This finding suggests that the Japanese diet would not be as healthy as expected,” said Shinozaki. “Wherever you may be, at the individual level, increasing the consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, would be helpful. At the societal level, public awareness campaigns, policy and regulation, or food availability and market changes to promote the reduction of HPFs could be beneficial. Our findings support ongoing efforts to develop nutritional guidelines and public health strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of diet-related diseases.”

To elucidate thein vivomechanisms underlying this extraordinary resilience, methods for genetically manipulating tardigrades have long been desired. Despite our prior success in somatic cell gene editing by microinjecting Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) into the body cavity of tardigrades, the generation of gene-edited individuals remained elusive. In this study, employing an extremotolerant parthenogenetic tardigrade species,Ramazzottius varieornatus, we established conditions that led to the generation of gene-edited tardigrade individuals. Drawing inspiration from the direct parental CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR) technique employed in several insects, we simply injected a concentrated Cas9 RNP solution into the body cavity of parental females shortly before their initial oviposition. This approach yielded gene-edited G0progeny. Notably, only a single allele was predominantly detected at the target locus for each G0individual, indicative of homozygous mutations. By co-injecting single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) with Cas9 RNPs, we achieved the generation of homozygously knocked-in G0progeny, and these edited alleles were inherited by G1/G2progeny. This is the first example of heritable gene editing in the entire phylum of Tardigrada. This establishment of a straightforward method for generating homozygous knockout/knock-in individuals not only facilitatesin vivoanalyses of the molecular mechanisms underpinning extreme tolerance, but also opens up avenues for exploring various topics, including Evo-Devo, in tardigrades. Tardigrades, tiny aquatic invertebrates also known as water bears, are celebrated for their extraordinary resilience to various extreme stresses like dehydration, radiation, and unusual ranges of temperature and pressure. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of this resilience not only satisfies scientific curiosity but also holds promise for the development of innovative technologies for the dry preservation of biomaterials like biomedicines and vaccines. However, the lack of a heritable genome manipulation technology has hinderedin vivoanalyses of these mechanisms. This study addresses this longstanding challenge in the field. Employing an extremotolerant parthenogenetic tardigrade species, we established conditions that enable the efficient production of gene-manipulated individuals. Using these conditions, the simple injection of Cas9 genome-editing components into parental females leads to the generation of knockout/knock-in progeny. Unlike similar approaches in other animals, we obtained mutant progeny predominantly carrying a single type of mutation, namely, homozygous mutants, which significantly facilitates downstream analyses. This is the first report of a heritable gene-editing method in the entire group of tardigrades. The establishment of this straightforward method for generating gene-manipulated tardigrades not only facilitatesin vivoanalyses of the molecular mechanisms underpinning extreme tolerance, but also opens up avenues for exploring various topics, including Evo-Devo.

Competing interests:The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Tardigrades are microscopic invertebrates living in marine, limnic, and limno-terrestrial habitats. All of them require water in their surroundings to grow and reproduce. To date, more than 1,400 tardigrade species have been described [1]. Among them, some limno-terrestrial species are known to withstand the almost complete loss of water by entering a reversible ametabolic dehydrated state referred to as anhydrobiosis [2], and tardigrades can be stored in a desiccated state at room temperature, sometimes for over a decade [3]. Dehydrated tardigrades exhibit extraordinary resilience against various extreme stresses that would kill most other animals, such as low temperature (-273°C), intense irradiation, the vacuum of space, and high hydrostatic pressure (7.5 GPa) [4–8]. This resilience is believed to arise from their remarkable cellular protection and repair mechanisms, which safeguard essential biomolecules and structures such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and membranes, supporting cellular functions. Understanding the molecular players and mechanisms involved in these processes not only satisfies scientific curiosity but also holds promise for the development of innovative technologies with significant implications for the storage and distribution of valuable but fragile biomaterials, like biomedicines and vaccines. Despite the growing interest in tardigrade resilience, the molecular mechanisms underlying this resilience have remained largely elusive. Some other desiccation-tolerant animals are known to accumulate and utilize non-reducing sugar, trehalose, as a vitrifying protectant against desiccation [9–11]. However, in anhydrobiotic tardigrades, trehalose accumulates at much lower levels or is even undetectable [12,13]. Instead, recently accumulating studies of tardigrades have suggested that they possess and utilize their own unique protective proteins whose expression is high and/or significantly induced upon desiccation during anhydrobiosis [14–17]. Owing to technological limitations, their functions and roles in tardigrade resilience have been elucidated largely using heterologous expression and/orin vitrosystems [15,16,18–23]. Although RNAi is feasible for analyzing gene function and has been successfully used in some cases [18,24,25], the knockdown efficiency varied depending on the target gene and was not always sufficient. We developed a method of delivering Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to adult tardigrade cells in a largely transparent and anhydrobiotic tardigrade species,Hypsibius exemplaris[26]. By microinjecting Cas9 RNPs into the body cavity of adult tardigrades and subsequent electroporation, we demonstrated that gene editing took place in some somatic cells of the injected tardigrades [26]. The same study also revealed that electroporation is not a prerequisite and the microinjection of Cas9 RNPs into the body cavity alone is sufficient to induce gene editing in some somatic cells in the tardigrades. However, tardigrade eggs are vulnerable to injection/needle-pricking [26], and the delivery to germline cells and subsequent generation of gene-edited individuals has not yet been achieved. Recently, Shiraiet al. (2022) developed a new gene-editing method termed direct parental CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR) in cockroaches and red flour beetles [27]. Using DIPA-CRISPR, gene-edited progeny (G0) can be obtained by simply injecting Cas9 RNPs into the hemocoel of parental female insects. The injected Cas9 RNPs are assumed to be incorporated into vitellogenic oocytes concomitantly with the massive uptake of yolk precursors. In agreement with this assumption, in DIPA-CRISPR it was shown to be critical for females to be injected at appropriate stages during vitellogenesis prior to the first oviposition. Our previous observations that injection alone was sufficient for the delivery of Cas9 RNPs to induce gene editing in somatic cells in the tardigrades and the successful generation of gene-edited progeny by DIPA-CRISPR in some insects prompted us to find out the appropriate conditions to enable the generation of gene-edited tardigrade individuals using a DIPA-CRISPR-like method. In this study, we employed an anhydrobiotic and extremotolerant tardigrade,Ramazzottius varieornatus(Fig 1A–1C), because its genome sequence is available [16] and it lays eggs outside of exuviae, which helped us to collect eggs and obtain many individuals at the same age for injection. We particularly examined two critical parameters, the concentration of Cas9 RNPs and the age of females to be injected, both of which were quite different between our previous somatic cell gene editing in tardigrades and the original DIPA-CRISPR in insects [26,27]. By adjusting the conditions, we successfully obtained gene-edited progeny (G0) for two target genes.R.varieornatusis a parthenogenetic species that lays eggs without mating. We found that most of the obtained gene-edited G0progeny carried the edited alleles in a homozygous form. In addition, we found that the simultaneous injection of single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) with the Cas9 RNPs led to the generation of knock-in progeny. To our surprise, the gene-editing efficiency in the knock-in trials was comparable to that in the knockout trials.

To obtain parental females at the defined age, eggs were collected and their hatching was examined daily. Newly hatched juveniles (0 days old) were separated and reared for the defined period prior to injection. After the injection of Cas9 RNPs, the injected tardigrades were reared for 10 days, and the laid eggs (G0progeny) were collected and reared. Grown G0individuals were separately subjected to genomic DNA extraction and PCR. PCR amplicons were directly analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Gene-edited G0progeny were obtained from parents injected at 7 to 10 days old. Representative photographs ofR.varieornatuseggs (A) and individuals at 8 (B) and 10 days old (C).

This is the first example of heritable gene editing in the entire phylum of Tardigrada, and this gene-editing method should substantially promotein vivoanalysis of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the extreme tolerance of tardigrades. In addition to their renowned resilience, tardigrades are becoming increasingly recognized as an emerging model for evolutionary and developmental biological study [28]. This is because the phylum Tardigrada has a close taxonomic relationship with two phyla containing super model invertebrates,Drosophila melanogaster(phylum Arthropoda) andCaenorhabditis elegans(phylum Nematoda), and would be expected to comprise suitable organisms for comparative study among them. Our method will also open up avenues for studying various Evo-Devo topics using tardigrades. In DIPA-CRISPR, a relatively high concentration of Cas9 protein was used in the injection solution (3.3 μg/μL) compared with that in our previous tardigrade study (0.41 μg/μL;S1 Table) [26,27]; a lower concentration of Cas9 protein was reported to decrease the gene-editing efficiency [27]. Therefore, we attempted to increase the concentration of Cas9 protein in the injection solution. However, the commercial Cas9 protein solution usually contains a relatively high concentration of glycerol (e.g., 50% glycerol in IDT product), which could affect the viability of the injected animals. Accordingly, we first examined how a high concentration of glycerol can be tolerated by the injected tardigrades. As shown inS2 Table, the injection of 20% glycerol solution severely decreased the survival rate to 20%, while the survival rate remained at around half (45.5%) when using 15% glycerol solution. We thus chose to use a 15% glycerol concentration, which allows 3.0 μg/μL Cas9 protein in the injection solution, comparable to the level in the original DIPA-CRISPR method [27]. The experimental scheme of DIPA-CRISPR in tardigrades is shown inFig 1D. In the original DIPA-CRISPR, the developmental stage of the parents to be injected was one of the most critical parameters for successful gene editing in the progeny [27]. In most cases, the best stage is shortly before the first oviposition, which is consistent with the idea that Cas9 RNPs could be transported to oocytes concomitantly with the massive uptake of yolk precursors during vitellogenesis. Given thatR.varieornatususually starts to lay eggs around 10 days after hatching [8], we examined the period between 5 and 10 days after hatching for the injections into the tardigrades, as younger tardigrades (<5 days old) appeared to be too immature and were too small to be injected. We chose the geneRvY_01244as a target, which encodes an ABC transporter belonging to the G subfamily (ABCG). Although some members of the ABCG family are known to be related to pigmentation in insects, such aswhite,scarlet, andbrowngenes inDrosophila melanogaster[29], phylogenetic analysis suggested thatRvY_01244is not orthologous to those pigmentation-related members and its relationship to pigmentation was unclear (S1 Fig). To improve the gene-editing efficiency, we synthesized three crRNAs (Fig 2A) and injected RNP solution containing all three of them into parental tardigrades of each age from 5 to 10 days old. We expected that some intervening regions among the three crRNA targets would be deleted from the genome, which would be easily detected by examining the genomic PCR amplicon size. In total, we injected 414 parental tardigrades, 129 of which survived for more than 1 day (31.2% survival,Table 1). Using whole bodies of G0progeny, we successfully obtained genomic PCR amplicons for about 103 of 225 G0progeny and found one sample termed m1 that had a distinctly smaller amplicon size than that expected from the unmodified genome (Fig 2B). Direct sequencing of the short amplicon revealed complicated editing at the target locus. Specifically, the intervening region (205 bp) between crRNA1 and crRNA2 was lost and the 1,362 bp DNA fragment between crRNA2 and crRNA3 was re-inserted in the reverse orientation (Fig 2C). Notably, only the short amplicon was obtained from this sample (Fig 2B) and no mixed peaks were detected in the direct Sanger sequencing data. This suggested that this tardigrade carried the edited allele homozygously at the target locus, or carried another mutated allele that suppresses the PCR amplification around the target site (e.g., a huge deletion). Further direct sequencing of the remaining PCR amplicons with the same size as WT bands identified three additional gene-edited G0progeny, termed m2, m3, and m4. Among these mutants, m2 carried a 1-nt insertion at the crRNA1 cleavage site (Fig 2D) and m3 carried a 3-nt deletion at the crRNA3 cleavage site (Fig 2E). Again, almost no mixed peaks were detected in the direct Sanger sequencing data of both samples (Fig 2D and 2E), suggesting that both G0progeny were homozygous at the edited locus. We obtained similar results using a different primer set producing a longer amplicon, confirming the homozygosity of these edits (S2 Fig). The remaining m4 mutant carried two mutations. One was a 1-nt insertion at the crRNA1 site, which showed no mixed peaks, suggesting its homozygosity. The other one was a mutation at the crRNA3 site that exhibited partly mixed peaks in Sanger data, which could be interpreted as a mixture of two sequences: the unmodified genome and a 1-nt insertion at the cleavage site of crRNA3 (Fig 2F). The peak signals of the unmodified sequence were generally stronger than those of the 1-nt inserted sequence, suggesting that the 1-nt insertion might have occurred in a minor cell population during the development of this G0progeny, resulting in mosaicism.

Among four obtainedRvY_01244mutants, three of them, m1, m2, and m4, exhibited significant growth retardation. Two of them, m1 and m2 were sacrificed for genotyping at 10 and 12 days old, respectively, when they were very small and their body color was barely visible, while m4 was cultured for an extended period until 16 days old, at which point its body color became brown though its body was still much shorter than usual (S3A Fig). These three mutants carried frameshift mutations near the N-terminus of the target protein and thus the protein function was likely disrupted. Meanwhile, no significant phenotype was observed in the m3 mutant carrying a 3-nt deletion, which causes the deletion of one amino acid without a frameshift. The observed phenotype appeared to be consistent with the severity of the corresponding mutations at theRvY_01244locus, but unexpectedly we frequently observed significant growth retardation even in many G0siblings carrying no edits at the target locus (S3B Fig). It is thus unclear whether the frameshift mutation at theRvY_01244gene causes growth retardation, but the observed phenotype of the m4 mutant suggested that brown coloration can proceed even with the frameshift in this gene. Overall, the gene-editing efficiency (GEF; the proportion of gene-edited individuals among all sequenced individuals) identified here was 3.9% (Table 1). A total of four gene-edited G0progeny were obtained from the parental animals injected at 7 to 10 days old. Although this GEF is somewhat lower than in the original DIPA-CRISPR, our results indicated that DIPA-CRISPR works and can be used to generate gene knockout individuals in this tardigrade species. Next, we examined the general applicability of this methodology to other genes. As the next target, we chosetps-tpp, a gene responsible for trehalose synthesis. Trehalose is known to play important roles in desiccation tolerance in several anhydrobiotic animals, such as nematodes, a sleeping chironomid, and brine shrimps [9–11]. In tardigrades, however, trehalose production is not a common feature in anhydrobiotic species and the trehalose synthesis gene has been found in only two lineages: superfamily Macrobiotoidea and genusRamazzottius[30]. A previous comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of thetps-tppgene in the animal kingdom suggested that two tardigrade lineages, one of which includesR.varieornatus, have independently acquired distinct bacterial trehalose synthesis genes via horizontal gene transfer [30].R.varieornatushas a singletps-tppgene (RvY_13060), which encodes a fusion enzyme of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (TPP). This enzyme is sufficient to produce trehalose from glucose-6-phosphate and UDP-glucose [16,30]. We designed two crRNAs targeting exon 8 or exon 9 of thetps-tppgene, both of which are located within the TPS domain (Fig 3A), and injected RNP solution containing both of them into parental tardigrades from 7 to 10 days old. As shown inTable 2, we obtained five G0progeny carrying edited genes. Of these, one was the offspring of a parent injected at 7 days old and four were offspring of those injected at 10 days old. In total, GEF was 3.4%. In all examined G0progeny including the gene-edited ones, genomic PCR amplicons were essentially detected as a single band in agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig 3B). Sanger sequencing of the amplicons revealed that four of the five gene-edited G0progeny carried distinct insertions or deletions without apparent mixed peaks, suggesting that they carried homozygous mutations (Figs3CandS4A–S4D). The remaining one exhibited partly mixed peaks in Sanger data, which could be interpreted as a mixture of two sequences, namely, the unmodified genome and a 1-nt deletion at the cleavage site of crRNA1, although both sequences commonly carried a 333 bp deletion at the cleavage site of crRNA2 (Fig 3C and 3D). The peak signals of the unmodified sequence were generally more intense than those of the sequence with a 1-nt deletion, suggesting that the 1-nt deletion might have occurred in a minor cell population during the development of this G0progeny, resulting in mosaicism, while the 333 bp deletion likely occurred in the oocyte stage, resulting in its homozygosity.

To examine the effects oftps-tppknockout on tardigrade physiology, we next attempted to establishtps-tpp-knockout strains by rearing G0individuals until they laid G1eggs before sacrifice for genotyping. We again injected Cas9 RNPs with the two same crRNAs targetingtps-tppinto parental tardigrades aged 7 to 10 days old. After rearing the G0progeny until they laid G1eggs, we analyzed the genome sequence of each G0progeny. As shown inTable 3, we obtained six G0progeny carrying the edited genes among 151 examined individuals (GEF = 4.0%). Of those, four individuals had the same editing, which was a 1-nt insertion at the crRNA2 cleavage site (Fig 3E). One of the other two remaining individuals had 8-nt and 3-nt deletions at the crRNA1 and crRNA2 cleavage sites, respectively (Fig 3E), while the other one had a 484-nt deletion between crRNA1 and crRNA2 (Fig 3E). Again, in all edited G0individuals, only a single amplicon was detected in agarose gel electrophoresis, and no mixed peaks were detected in direct Sanger sequencing (S4E and S4F Fig). We also re-performed PCR using a different primer set from some genomic DNA samples of the gene-edited G0progeny and obtained the same results: no mixed peaks were present in those amplicons (S5 Fig). Each G0individual carrying the edited genes laid several G1eggs (2–8 eggs/G0individual), with 24 eggs in total from six G0individuals (S3 Table). However, unexpectedly, all of the G1eggs from the gene-edited G0individuals failed to hatch (hatching rate: 0%;S3 Table). Meanwhile, the hatchability of G1eggs laid by G0individuals with no editing was 89.5% (S4 Table). These observations suggested that the editing of thetps-tppgene impaired the hatchability of the G1progeny inR.varieornatus.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011298.t003 The CRISPR-Cas9 system including DIPA-CRISPR has been used to generate not only gene knockout individuals, but also knock-in ones, which enables precise modification of the target genome region as designed. To investigate whether the method above is applicable for gene knock-in in tardigrades, we co-injected single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) with Cas9 RNPs into tardigrades aged 7 to 10 days old. We again targeted the geneRvY_01244(ABCG). We designed the crRNA near the C-terminus of the coding sequence and the ssODNs to introduce 11 separate single-nucleotide substitutions; 10 of them were synonymous mutations, including two mutations in PAM, while the other one changed the amino acid from valine (GTG) to methionine (ATG) (Fig 4A). As shown inTable 4, we obtained five G0progeny carrying edited genes out of 107 examined G0individuals (GEF = 4.7%). Three of them exhibited a clear single sequence without mixed peaks in Sanger sequencing, in which every nucleotide at the 11 positions was completely substituted as designed in the ssODNs (Fig 4B). This suggested that they carried the knocked-in allele in a homozygous manner. Sanger sequencing data of another gene-edited individual exhibited a mixture of the fully knocked-in sequence as a major peak and the unmodified (WT) sequence as a minor one (Fig 4B), suggesting the mosaicism of the individual. The remaining individual exhibited a more complicated pattern; it carried a 1-nt insertion at the crRNA cleavage site in a homozygous manner, and also exhibited mixed peaks of the knocked-in sequence and the unmodified sequence at the two modification sites furthest from the crRNA cleavage site (Fig 4B).

G1progeny were separately reared and subjected to genotyping after laying G2eggs. From a perfectly knocked-in G0individual, one G1progeny was successfully reared and propagated, in which all of the examined G1and G2progeny were confirmed to carry the perfectly knocked-in allele in the homozygous form (S6 FigandS5 Table). In terms of their appearance, those homozygous knock-in individuals looked similar to those carrying no edits (S7 Fig). From the G0individual carrying a mixture of the knocked-in sequence as a major peak and the unmodified sequence as a minor one, five G1progeny were obtained. Although one G1progeny could not be genotyped owing to amplification failure, the other four G1progeny were confirmed to carry the fully knocked-in sequence homozygously and G2progeny of each G1individual were confirmed to carry the same knock-in sequence (S5 Table). Thus, the observed knocked-in sequence was successfully inherited by the progeny. From the remaining G0progeny that carried the homozygous 1-nt insertion and mosaic 2-nt knocked-in sequence, one G1egg that carried only the 1-nt insertion was obtained. The detected 2-nt knock-in sequence as a mosaic did not appear to be heritable, while the homozygous 1-nt insertion was heritable (S5 Table). In this study, we demonstrated that DIPA-CRISPR successfully worked in an extremotolerant parthenogenetic tardigrade. In the original DIPA-CRISPR, the injected Cas9 RNPs are assumed to be incorporated into vitellogenic oocytes concomitantly with the massive uptake of vitellogenins by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, injecting the individuals at appropriate developmental stages was one of the critical parameters for successfully obtaining gene-edited progeny [27]. As we have no knowledge of the vitellogenic process inR.varieornatus, we injected parental tardigrades at 5 to 10 days old, which corresponds to the stage just before the first oviposition, and obtained gene-edited progeny from the parents injected at 7 to 10 days old. In a related tardigrade species,H.exemplaris, which belongs to the same taxonomic family asR.varieornatus, the vitellogenic process appears to consist of three distinct modes lasting 4 days: the first part of the yolk is synthesized by the oocyte itself (autosynthesis); the second part is synthesized by trophocytes and transported to the oocyte through cytoplasmic bridges; and the third part is synthesized outside the ovary and transported to the oocyte by endocytosis [31]. In this three-step process of vitellogenesis, the injected Cas9 RNPs could be incorporated into oocytes during the third stage. InR.varieornatus, the germ cells could take up the injected Cas9 RNPs in this way. R.varieornatusis a diploid parthenogenetic species [8,16], but its cytological processes of progeny production and the mode of inheritance of genetic materials have remained unclear. Ammermann (1967) reported the cytological processes of diploid parthenogenetic reproduction in a related tardigrade species,Hypsibius dujardini, which is a species complex containing the recently redescribedH.exemplarisand belongs to the same taxonomic family asR.varieornatus[32,33]. During oogenesis inH.dujardini, the female germ cells undergo the first meiosis and daughter cells receive the mostly homozygous dyads derived from the meiotic bivalent chromosomes. After that, the dyad disintegrates and the diploidy is recovered in the daughter cells. Meiosis is completed by the subsequent mitosis-like process of the second meiosis, which maintains the diploidy. According to this cytological process, the chromosomes of the oocytes are predicted to be largely homozygous, except the small possible heterozygous regions that could be derived from chromosomal crossover during the first meiosis. In our genotyping analyses of the edited G0individuals ofR.varieornatus, only a single sequence was detected in most direct Sanger sequencing, suggesting that most G0progeny carried the edited allele in a homozygous manner (Figs2B–2E,3B, 3C, 3E,4B,S2,S4andS5). Notably, a similar result was obtained in the case of the very complicated editing of theRvY_01244(ABCG) gene by three crRNAs, in which one intervening region was deleted and the other intervening fragment was re-inserted in the reverse orientation (Fig 2C). It is unlikely that the Cas9 RNPs independently performed the same complicated editing on both alleles in a germ cell. Thus, this result is very difficult to explain ifR.varieornatusundergoes clonal (ameiotic) propagation. If the cytological process of parthenogenetic reproduction inR.varieornatusis similar to that inH.dujardini, it is assumed that the CRISPR-Cas9 system would edit the single allele in a germ cell before meiosis, and the mutation would then be replicated and transferred to the mature egg cell in a homozygous form during the meiotic process (S8 Fig). This is good news for researchers because a homozygous mutant could be obtained in a single step and can be parthenogenetically propagated without the need for further crossing, which significantly facilitates downstream analyses. In some haplodiploid arthropods, males carry a haploid genome, although females are diploid, and thus the similar application of CRISPR system to parental females often produces mutant male progeny carrying a single mutant allele hemizygously [34,35]. However, in these cases, multiple crossings and selections are needed to establish homozygous mutant strains. In parthenogenetic species, it is generally difficult to apply Mendelian genetic approaches, but some species likeR.varieornatusmight have an advantage in reverse genetics. In our genotyping data, a few cases showed weak mixed peaks (Figs2F,3C, 3Dand4B). We assumed that these minor peaks were derived from mosaic mutations, which might occur via the delayed action of the remaining Cas9 RNPs in a small cell population during the development of G0progeny. In general, gene knock-in mediated by homology-directed repair (HDR) tends to occur at a much lower rate than gene knockout mediated by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) [36–39], although germ cells are more prone to HDR than somatic cells [40]. In the original DIPA-CRISPR, the proportion of edited individuals among the total number of individuals hatched in knock-in trials was 1.2%, while it was 50.8%–71.4% in knockout trials in red flour beetles at the optimized stages [27]. In this study, however, knock-in efficiency was comparable to that of knockout (4.7% and 3.4%–4.0%, respectively) and we rarely observed short indels by NHEJ-mediated repair in the knock-in experiments. This suggested that HDR might be a dominant repair mode in the germ cells of this tardigrade species. Notably, usingR.varieornatus(in this study), we did not observe the tendency for no-indel NHEJ that was observed in somatic cells ofH.exemplarisin our previous study [26]. This could be consistent with the relatively low efficiency of NHEJ-dependent repair (knockout) in this study. In gene-editing experiments targeting theRvY_01244(ABCG) gene, no significant phenotype was observed in the mutants carrying single amino acid deletion near the N-terminus (m3) or substitution near the C-terminus (knock-in), suggesting that these mutations did not significantly affect the gene function ofRvY_01244. The mutants carrying frameshift mutations near the N-terminus (m1, m2, and m4) exhibited growth retardation and slow coloration compared with uninjected individuals, but a similar phenotype was observed in the G0siblings carrying no edits at the target locus (S3 Fig). It remains unclear why the unedited siblings exhibited similar growth retardation. We cannot rule out the possibility that these phenotypes could be derived from an off-target effect, although all designed crRNAs (even 12-mer near PAM) exhibited a unique match in the genome sequence. As shown inS3 Fig, brown coloration could proceed even in the m4 mutant carrying a frameshift mutation inRvY_01244. These results could be consistent with the phylogenetic analysis in which RvY_01244 was shown to be non-orthologous to pigment-related ABCG members likewhite,brown, andscarlet(S1 Fig). In alltps-tpp-edited mutants obtained in this study, a frameshift was introduced at the putative cleavage sites of crRNA1 or crRNA2, both of which were located within the TPS domain (Fig 3A). Thus, the mutatedtps-tppgene products likely lost the function of the C-terminal region of TPS and the whole of TPP (Fig 3A). Because the C-terminal region of TPS is responsible for the binding to the substrate UDP-glucose [41], the TPS activity was likely lost in the edited tardigrades as well. In alltps-tpp-edited mutants, G0individuals were able to hatch, grow, and lay eggs normally, but no G1eggs hatched (S3 Table). The hatchability of G1eggs was significantly lower intps-tpp-edited mutants than in those harboring no editing in thetps-tppgene (p= 2.57e-15, Fisher’s exact test). These results suggested that the mutations in thetps-tppgene had a maternal effect on the hatchability of the embryos in this tardigrade species. For instance, trehalose could be synthesized in maternal tissue and transported to the oocyte and might play important roles in embryogenesis of the progeny, for example, as an energy reserve. In the cockroachPeriplaneta americana, treatment with the trehalase inhibitor validoxylamine A (VAA) inhibited normal oocyte development, indicating that trehalose is necessary for successful oocyte development in this insect species [42]. However, we would like to keep the question open of whether trehalose itself plays an important role in tardigrade physiology. This is because the TPS-TPP protein ofR.varieornatuscontains an extraordinarily long N-terminal region, which exhibits sequence similarity with trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase. This N-terminal region could be translated even in thetps-tppmutants and the truncated gene products might be harmful and responsible for the observed phenotype in this study, instead of trehalose reduction. In summary, we have successfully established a method for generating both gene knockout and gene knock-in individuals in the anhydrobiotic and extremotolerant tardigrade speciesR.varieornatus, by adjusting the conditions of DIPA-CRISPR. Our findings indicated that the optimal injection window is between 7 and 10 days after hatching, aligning with the period shortly before the first oviposition in this species. The simple injection of Cas9 RNPs (with knock-in donor when necessary) into parental tardigrades at the appropriate age is sufficient to obtain the edited progeny. Notably, such progeny predominantly carried the edited allele in homozygous form, which was probably attributable to the meiotic parthenogenetic mode of reproduction. This feature significantly facilitates loss-of-function analyses downstream. While DIPA-CRISPR and similar methods were initially developed in arthropods [27,43], our study shows its effectiveness in a non-arthropod organism, underscoring the broad applicability of this method to various invertebrate species, including other tardigrades. This method should facilitatein vivoanalysis of various topics in tardigrades, including the molecular mechanisms underlying their renowned extreme tolerance as well as many Evo-Devo-related issues. Ramazzottius varieornatusYOKOZUNA-1 strain was reared as described previously [22]. Briefly, tardigrades were maintained in 1.2% agar plates overlaid with sterilized pure water (Elix Advantage 3 UV, Millipore) containing live chlorella suspension (Recenttec) as food at 22°C. Water and food were replaced once a week. To prepare the staged tardigrades for injection, eggs were collected from culture dishes and transferred to a new agar dish with food after cleaning treatment with 1% commercial chlorine bleach. The next day, unhatched eggs and eggshells were removed from the dish to leave only newly hatched juveniles, which were defined as 0 days old. These juveniles were reared as described above until the appropriate age. S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3, CRISPR-Cas9 tracrRNA, and crRNAs were purchased from IDT. For each target genome region, the list of possible crRNAs and off-target information inR.varieornatuswere retrieved using CRISPR direct (https://crispr.dbcls.jp/) and on-target scores of crRNAs were also obtained from the manufacturer’s website (https://sg.idtdna.com/site/order/designtool/index/CRISPR_CUSTOM). Based on this information, appropriate crRNAs were selected as described inS6 Table. Cas9 complex (RNPs) was prepared as essentially described previously while increasing the concentration of each component [26]. Briefly, the mixture of crRNAs and tracrRNA (final 100 μM for each) was heated at 95°C for 5 min and then gradually cooled to room temperature. In a 10 μL scale, 1 μL of PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4), 3 μL of 10 μg/μL Cas9 protein (IDT, final 3.0 μg/μL), and 6 μL of 100 μM gRNA (final 60 μM) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min to assemble Cas9 RNPs. Cas9 RNP solution was kept at -80°C until use. The injections were performed as described previously [26]. Briefly, the staged animals were anesthetized in 25 mM levamisole (Sigma) and mounted on an injection slide. The injection slide was placed on an inverted differential interference contrast microscope (Axiovert 405 M, Zeiss). A glass capillary needle was prepared from a glass capillary (GD-1, Narishige) using a needle puller (PC-10, Narishige). Cas9 RNP solution was filled into the glass capillary needle and injected into a body cavity of a tardigrade using FemtoJet 4i (Eppendorf) with the following settings: pi = 1500 hPa, ti = 0.20 s, and pc = 50 hPa. Successful injection was confirmed by swelling of the specimen. Injected individuals were recovered onto agar plates with sterilized water and maintained with food until they laid eggs (G0). We collected G0eggs laid within 10 days after injection. Successfully hatched G0progeny were subjected to genotyping before or after laying eggs (G1). Genomic PCR was performed as described in a previous study with some modifications [26]. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from each G0individual in 10 μL of protease K solution (500 μg/mL, in 0.5× KOD FX Neo PCR buffer; TOYOBO) by incubating at 60°C for 120 min. Protease K was then inactivated by heating at 95°C for 15 min. Genome samples were stored at -20°C until the PCR reaction. Primers were designed to include all target sites of crRNAs (S6 Table). The target regions were amplified from genome samples of approximately 0.5 to 2 μL using KOD FX Neo (TOYOBO) in a 10 μL reaction. PCR amplicons were examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). Genomic PCR products that were confirmed to be represented by a single band in AGE were subjected to direct Sanger sequencing after decomposing the remaining nucleotides and primers by treatment with 2U Exonuclease I (NEB) and 0.1U Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (NEB). ssODNs were designed to introduce 11 separate single-nucleotide substitutions, two of which involved mutation of the PAM sequence (S6 Table). The designed ssODNs (189 bases) were synthesized by and purchased from IDT. RNP solution was prepared as described above and 10 μL of it was mixed with 1 μL of 14.5 μg/μL ssODNs (final 1.3 μg/μL) and used for injection. The solution was kept at -80°C until use. Phylogenetic analysis of the ABCG family was performed essentially in accordance with a previously reported procedure [44]. Full-length protein sequences of 66 ABCG proteins of four insects and one tardigrade were retrieved from the NCBI protein database (S1 Data). As an outgroup, three ABCH protein sequences ofD.melanogasterwere included in the analysis. Those sequences were aligned using Muscle 3.8.425 [45]. A maximum likelihood analysis was performed with the substitution model LG using PhyML 3.3.20180621 as a plugin in Geneious software (Dotmatics) [46]. Phylogenetic analysis using 66 ABCG proteins from a tardigrade (Rv,Ramazzottius varieornatus) and four insects (AG,Anopheles gambiae; Am,Apis mellifera; Dm,Drosophila melanogaster; Tc,Tribolium castaneum). Maximum likelihood analysis was performed with the substitution model LG. Red indicates the gene targeted by CRISPR-Cas9 in this study. Three proteins of ABC transporter subfamily H were used as an outgroup. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1011298.s001 (TIF) (A) Schematic representation of the second primer set (magenta arrows) with the structure of theRvY_01244(ABCG) gene, three crRNAs (brown arrows), and the original set of PCR primers (blue arrows).

PLOS is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, #C2354500, based in San Francisco, California, US","Some species of tardigrades are highly and unusually resilient to various extreme conditions fatal to most other forms of life. The genetic basis for these exceptional abilities remains elusive. For the first time, researchers from the University of Tokyo successfully edited genes using the CRISPR technique in a highly resilient tardigrade species previously impossible to study with genome-editing tools. The successful delivery of CRISPR to an asexual tardigrade species directly produces gene-edited offspring. The design and editing of specific tardigrade genes allow researchers to investigate which are responsible for tardigrade resilience and how such resilience can work.
If you’ve heard about tardigrades, then you’ve no doubt heard about their uncommon abilities to survive things like extreme heat, cold, drought, and even the vacuum of space, which different members of the species possess. So naturally, they attract researchers keen to explore these novelties, not just out of curiosity, but also to look at what applications might one day be possible if we learn their secrets.
“To understand tardigrades’ superpowers, we first need to understand the way their genes function,” said Associate Professor Takekazu Kunieda from the Department of Biological Sciences. “My team and I have developed a method to edit genes — adding, removing or overwriting them — like you would do on computer data, in a very tolerant species of tardigrade, Ramazzottius varieornatus. This can now allow researchers to study tardigrade genetic traits as they might more established lab-based animals, such as fruit flies or nematodes.”
The team used a recently developed technique called direct parental CRISPR (DIPA-CRISPR), based on the now-famous CRISPR gene-editing technique, which can serve as a genetic scalpel to cut and modify specific genes more efficiently than ever before. DIPA-CRISPR has the advantage of being able to affect the genome of a target organism’s offspring and had previously been shown to work on insects, but this is the first time it’s been used on the noninsect organisms that include tardigrades. Ramazzottius varieornatus is an all-female species that reproduces asexually, and almost all offspring turned out to have two identical copies of the same edited code, unlike other animals, making it an ideal candidate for DIPA-CRISPR.
“We simply needed to inject CRISPR tools programmed to target specific genes for removal into the body of a parent to obtain modified offspring, known as ‘knock-out’ editing,” said Koyuki Kondo, project researcher at the time of the study (currently assistant professor at the Department of Life Science at Chiba Institute of Technology). “We could also obtain gene-modified offspring by injection of extra DNA fragments we want to include; this is called ‘knock-in’ editing. The availability of knock-in editing allows researchers to precisely edit tardigrade genomes, allowing them to, for example, control the way individual genes are expressed, or exhibit the genes’ functions.”
The main resilience trait this species demonstrates is their ability to survive extreme dehydration for long periods. This was previously shown to be partially due to aspecial kind of gel proteinin their cells. And this trait is interesting as it has also been applied to human cells. Kunieda and other tardigrade researchers think it’s worth exploring whether something like an entire human organ could one day be successfully dehydrated and rehydrated without degradation. If that is possible, it could revolutionize the way organs are donated, transported and used in surgery to save lives.
“I understand some people feel anxious about gene editing, but we performed the gene-editing experiments under well-controlled conditions and secured the edited organisms in a closed compartment,” said Kunieda. “CRISPR can be an incredible tool for understanding life and aiding in useful applications that can positively impact the world. Tardigrades not only offer us a glimpse at what medical advances might be possible, but their range of remarkable traits means they had an incredible evolutionary story, one we hope to tell as we compare their genomes to closely related creatures using our new DIPA-CRIPSR-based technique.”

However, the ""time view"" of procrastinators, including their impressions of the future, has not been sufficiently examined. Therefore, we introduced new indices, ""chronological stress view"" and ""chronological well-being view,"" which treat impressions of the past, present, and future (= time view) as time-series data via stress and well-being, respectively. The results showed that the group that believed that stress did not increase as they moved into the future had a lower percentage of severe procrastinators. No relationship was found between the chronological well-being view and procrastination. This result suggests that people who are relatively optimistic about the future based on the chronological stress view are less likely to be severe procrastinators. This may suggest the importance of having a hopeful prospect in the future to avoid procrastinating on actions that should yield greater rewards in the future. Procrastination is defined as ""the act of putting off a task even when one knows that doing so will have maladaptive consequences""1,2,3, and has been reported to reduce people's well-being and increase their stress4,5,6,7,8. Since procrastination deeply pervades people's daily lives and affects all aspects of their lives, various factors have been examined as related to procrastination, including personality traits such as the Big Five9,10,11,12, cognitive and motivational factors such as self-control13,14,15,16, and task traits such as task aversiveness17,18,19. Among these factors, temporal characteristics have played a central role in understanding procrastination since procrastination involves putting off ""present"" tasks to ""future"" ones. For example, in Steel & König's (2006) temporal motivation theory, procrastinators are thought to prioritize the action that provides a smaller but immediate reward over the action that should provide a larger reward in the long run because the subjective value of the reward is reduced (delay discounting) at a greater rate when the timing they get the reward is delayed19,20,21. Zhang & Feng (2020) further highlighted the impact of temporal trajectories in utility and aversiveness (e.g., the perceived task aversiveness is discounted hyperbolically when individuals postpone tasks) and constructed a temporal decision model for procrastination. Also, studies that examined the time perspective of procrastinators reported that procrastinators have weaker “future orientation” than low procrastinators and are less likely to plan and achieve future goals by actively linking the present and the future22,23,24. It has been shown that procrastinators consistently disregard the future more than low procrastinators do and that this tendency is one of the central antecedents of procrastination. Why do procrastinators disregard the future in the first place? Although the phenomenon of future disregard has been reported in numerous studies, the underlying factors have not been clarified until now22. Therefore, in this study, we examined the procrastinators' ""time view"" including the impression they have about the future, in order to verify the factors that form the procrastinators' future-neglectful view of time. In particular, we examined procrastinators' “time view” through stress and well-being. We focused on stress and well-being because of the abundance of previous studies examining the relationship between procrastination, and as mentioned at the beginning, it has been reported that procrastinators have higher levels of stress and lower levels of well-being4,5,6,7,8. Since stress and well-being are factors that significantly impact our lives and are generally considered negative and positive, we analyzed procrastinators' time views as comprehensively as possible with a low load for participants by selecting these two factors. In this study, we introduced new indices to treat procrastinators' views of time (especially their impressions of the future) as quantitatively as possible: the chronological stress view and chronological well-being view (see Fig.5for examples). In these indices, stress and well-being were asked at various time points in the past, present, and future (i.e., ""the past 10 years,"" ""the past 1 year,"" ""the past month,"" ""yesterday,"" ""now,"" ""tomorrow,"" ""the next month,"" “the next 1 year,” and ""the next 10 years.”). Then, the stress and well-being values obtained from these questions were arranged chronologically on the time axis and defined as the chronological stress and well-being views, respectively. Most previous studies asked questions on stress and well-being by specifying a single time axis. However, in this study, we asked about stress and well-being at various times and attempted to capture procrastinators’ time views through time-series data. Our new index, the chronological stress/well-being view, is expected to capture not only the one-dimensional aspect, that is, the magnitude of stress/well-being, but also the temporal characteristics of stress/well-being (i.e., patterns of change along the time axis), and therefore expected to reflect the ideas concerning stress/well-being (e.g., stress becomes lower in the future, and well-being increases in the future). Therefore, we decided to analyze not only the impact of absolute values of stress/well-being, but also the impact of temporal characteristics of the chronological stress/well-being view on procrastination. Specifically, chronological stress/well-being views were subjected to cluster analysis and classified into several groups based on temporal characteristics, and the proportions of severe procrastinators, middle procrastinators, and low procrastinators in each group were compared. As mentioned earlier, studies on time perspective have shown that procrastinators tend to disregard the future. Also, mediation analyses revealed that the relationship between procrastination and future time perspective is partially explained by high stress and low positive affect22. Thus, one possibility is that the disregard for the future manifests itself as a belief that future conditions will worsen, such as increased stress or decreased well-being. Therefore, we hypothesized that the group that holds thoughts that lead to disregard for the future (i.e., stress increases as one moves into the future and well-being decreases as one moves into the future) would be more likely to be severe procrastinators. The results support our hypothesis for stress and not for well-being. Specifically, we found that the proportion of severe procrastinators was lower in the group that believed that stress did not increase as one moved into the future. No relationship was found between the time series of well-being and procrastination. These results suggest that people with optimistic views of the future based on the chronological stress view may be less likely to be severe procrastinators. Since we newly introduced the chronological stress view and the chronological well-being view, we first analyzed the overall mean for each of these indices without distinguishing between severe procrastinators and low procrastinators. As shown in Fig.1, when stress (Fig.1A) and well-being levels (Fig.1B) were asked at various time points in the past, present, and future, both showed a ""V-shape"" with the lowest value around the ""present moment"" and increased as the time points moved away toward the past or future. The overall mean of the chronological stress view, chronological well-being view, (A) Overall mean of chronological stress view; x-axis from left to right: past 10 years, past 1 year, past 1 month, yesterday, now, tomorrow, next 1 month, next 1 year, and next 10 years. The y-axis represents the stress value plotted on the x-axis time axis. (B) The overall mean of the chronological well-being view. The y-axis represents the level of well-being. Error bars indicate SE between participants. The means and standard deviations of stress and well-being in each temporal frame are presented in Table1. We conducted a One-Way Repeated Measures ANOVA to examine whether there were statistically significant differences in stress/well-being levels across nine different temporal frames. For stress, the results revealed a significant effect of temporal frame on stress levels (F(8, 295) = 36.45,p< 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons using Tukey's HSD test indicated significant differences between 17/36 pairs (Table2). For well-being, the results revealed a significant effect of temporal frame on well-being levels (F(8, 295) = 9.80,p< 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons using Tukey's HSD test indicated significant differences between 4/36 pairs (Table2). Since no studies have asked about stress and well-being levels at various time points in this way, the study’s first finding was that the overall mean of the chronological stress view and chronological well-being view shows a pattern that could be subjectively labeled as V-shape. Before moving on to the analysis of temporal characteristics of the chronological stress/well-being views, we first conducted a basic analysis that would strongly capture the impact of the magnitude of stress/well-being in the chronological stress/well-being views on procrastination. Based on the procrastination scores of the Pure Procrastination Scale, we defined the top 25% as severe procrastinators, the bottom 25% as low procrastinators, and the middle 50% as middle procrastinators. We then plotted the chronological stress and well-being views separately for severe and low procrastinators. Although two-tailed t-tests with multiple comparison correction (Bonferroni) at each time point showed no significant differences except for stress at “the past month” and well-being at “the next 1 year,” we found an overall tendency of stress being higher in the severe procrastinator group (Fig.2A) and well-being being lower in the severe procrastinator group (Fig.2B) across all time points (“stress” the past 10 years:t(69) = 1.57,p= 0.12, the past year:t(69) = 2.53,p= 0.01, the past month:t(69) = 3.02,p= 0.003, yesterday:t(69) = 2.10,p= 0.04, now:t(69) = 1.52,p= 13, tomorrow: t(69) = 2.64,p= 0.009, the next month:t(69) = 2.32,p= 0.02, the next 1 year:t(69) = 1.49,p= 0.14, the next 10 years:t(69) = 2.03,p= 0.05, “well-being” the past 10 years:t(69) = -1.65,p= 0.10, the past year:t(69) = -2.52,p= 0.01, the past month:t(69) = -2.09,p= 0.04, yesterday:t(69) = -1.57,p= 0.12, now:t(69) = -1.27,p= 0.21, tomorrow:t(69) = -1.14,p= 0.26, the next month:t(69) = -2.13,p= 0.03, the next 1 year:t(69) = -2.82,p= 0.005, the next 10 years:t(69) = -1.80,p= 0.07. , corrected alpha = 0.00556). Figure 2 C-D shows the results of calculating the within-group means for the severe procrastinators and the low procrastinators, after each subject’ overall means for stress and well-being were calculated by ignoring the differences along the time axis (x-axis). We conducted two-tailed two-sample t-tests to compare the within-group means, and the results showed that the severe procrastinators had significantly higher stress (t(70) = 2.78,p= 0.006, Fig.2C) but lower well-being (t(70) = -2.30,p= 0.02, Fig.2D) compared to low procrastinators.

Error bars indicate SE between participants for each group. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). These results replicate previous research, as previous studies have shown that procrastinators have higher stress and lower well-being. At the same time, it was newly found that the same tendency is reproduced no matter what timeframe is used, even if the question is a prediction for the future. In the above analysis, we have confirmed that our study reproduces the tendency reported in previous studies that the magnitude of stress and well-being matters in procrastination. However, the above analysis did not reveal any differences between procrastinators and low procrastinators regarding factors encompassing temporal characteristics, such as patterns of change along the time axis (graph shape). Therefore, further analysis was conducted to extract the influence of individual time-series patterns, an essential aspect of the time view, by eliminating the influence of the magnitude of stress/well-being as much as possible. In order to extract the influence of the patterns of the time-series data, we first standardized each individual's data to minimize the influence of the magnitude of stress/well-being (see Data analysis in Methods for details). Then, we categorized the chronological stress and chronological well-being views by clustering analysis using the (Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method. The main reason for choosing cluster analysis is its ability to handle the dynamic nature of time-series data. Unlike latent profile analysis (LPA), typically used to identify latent groups within cross-sectional data based on underlying probability distribution assumptions, cluster analysis is suited to analyze patterns and trajectories in time-series data, this time stress/well-being along nine-time axes. In conducting the clustering analysis, the number of clusters was first examined using the elbow method, and the number of clusters was determined to be four in this analysis (seeSupplementary Information). As shown in Fig.3A-B and Fig.4A-B, the clustering analysis revealed that both chronological stress and chronological well-being views had descending, ascending, and V-shaped types, with stress having a skewed mountain type as the fourth cluster (Fig.3A-B) and well-being having a flat type as the fourth cluster (Fig.4A,B). The results indicate that, although the chronological stress and well-being views show a V-shape when averaged over the entire sample, they can be divided into several clusters. Descending: Stress/well-being decreases as one moves from the past to the present and into the future. Ascending: Stress/well-being increases as one moves from the past to the present and into the future. V-shape: Stress and well-being are the lowest in the present and increase as one moves away from the present. Skewed Mountain: Stress/well-being reaches its highest value at a point in the past and then declines toward the future. Flat: Stress/Well-being is constant Clusters of the chronological stress view and its relationship with procrastination, (A) Labels of clusters for the chronological stress view (standardized).

(C) Comparison of severe procrastinators (top 25% procrastination score, dark blue), low procrastinators (bottom 25% procrastination score, light blue), and middle procrastinators (middle 25% procrastination score, middle blue) ratios across clusters of chronological well-being view. To verify the influence of the types obtained from the cluster analysis on the tendency to procrastinate, the proportions of the severe procrastinators (top 25% procrastination score), middle procrastinators (middle 50%), and low procrastinators (bottom 25%) for each type were calculated and compared using a chi-square test. The results showed that there was a significant difference in chronological stress view (χ2(6) = 18.08,p= 0.006), between ""descending"" and ""ascending"" (p= 0.014), between ""descending"" and ""V-shape"" (p = 0.01), and between ""descending"" and ""skewed mountain"" (p= 0.02). A residual analysis revealed significant differences in the severe procrastinators (p= 0.002) and middle procrastinators group (p< 0.001) in the descending type (Fig.3C). No significant relationship was found between the chronological well-being view and procrastination (χ2(6) = 9.05,p= 0.17; Fig.4C). The significantly lower percentage of severe procrastinators in the descending clusters indicated that the group who believed that stress would decrease as they moved into the future, or at least not increase more than in the past, was less likely to be severe procrastinators. In this study, we introduced new indices, chronological stress and chronological well-being views, in which we asked about stress/well-being levels at various time points and attempted to examine the relationship between procrastinators' time views (impressions of the past, present, and future) and procrastination. We found that the procrastinators who believed that stress would decrease (or at least not increase more than in the past) as they moved into the future were less likely to be severe procrastinators. Although this study revealed that those who believed that stress would decrease as they moved into the future were less likely to be severe procrastinators, the relationship between procrastination and disregard for the future could have been manifested in other patterns as well (i.e., The groups who believe that stress will decrease in the future or well-being will increase in the future, i.e., those who have an optimistic view of the future, have a lower percentage of severe procrastinators or a higher percentage of low procrastinators. The group that believes that stress will increase in the future or the group that believes that well-being will decrease in the future, i.e., the group that has a pessimistic view of the future, have a higher percentage of severe procrastinators or a lower percentage of low procrastinators.). However, only one of the eight possible patterns emerged in this study. These findings suggest that stress-based optimistic view of the future plays a significant role in procrastination, especially in determining whether or not a person becomes a severe procrastinator. Further research is needed to investigate the causes of these asymmetric results. Previous studies have shown that procrastinators tend to disregard the future20,22. Although direct verification is required to confirm this finding, it is possible that procrastinators have a pessimistic view of the future and, therefore, disregard it. This may suggest the importance of having a hopeful prospect in the future to avoid postponing actions that should yield greater rewards in the long run. Direct approaches and intervention studies are needed to test these possibilities, such as examining the relationship between future orientation25, chronological stress view, and procrastination. In this study, we acquired a new finding that the overall mean of the chronological stress view is ""V-shaped."" One of the reasons for this result may be that the present stress level was asked first in our experiment and thus became the reference point for the following questions with different time axes. However, even if the value of the present stress level becomes the reference point, it cannot be the reason for the lowest score. Therefore, the appearance of the V-shaped data requires further examination. It is also necessary to verify whether the same tendency would be obtained if other methods measured the chronological stress view. In our study, we have focused on the “future” in particular. However, it should be noted that we measured stress/well-being on multiple temporal frames spanning the past, present, and future, and categorized chronological stress/well-being into several groups based on this continuous time-series data. In other words, ""future orientation"" in this study is not defined in terms of the future alone but based on the relationship between the past and the present. Therefore, future research should focus not only on the future but also on the past and present. Past studies using the time perspective scale have shown that procrastination has a small but significant positive association with the present time perspective22and that procrastinators have a higher past positive past positive orientation and lower past negative orientation23. Based on these findings, we should comprehensively examine the relationship between procrastination and the past, present, and future. Conventional studies on procrastination have argued simply that procrastinators are more stressed and less happy. However, this study found that not only the magnitude of stress but also the time-series stress patterns affect procrastination. Therefore, it can be said that this study shows for the first time the multilayered effect of stress on procrastination. It should be noted that the magnitude of stress and well-being values (parallel shifts in the vertical direction of the graph) can be included in the time view. However, previous studies have shown that the magnitude of the values affects procrastination4,5,6,7,8. Therefore, in this study, to focus on the difference from previous studies, we decided to treat the temporal characteristics, that is, patterns of change along the time axis (graph shape), as the main aspect of the time view. The relationship between the magnitude of stress and the time-series pattern of stress needs to be verified in the future. In the present study, individual data were categorized using clustering analysis, and it was confirmed that individual data did not always follow the V-shape expressed by the overall mean. This result suggests that to understand and intervene in the complex behavior of procrastination in daily life, it is necessary to analyze not only the overall tendency but also individual differences and provide personalized support. At the same time, since the sample size and area were limited in this study, additional examination is needed in the future to verify the universality of the findings. Also, the participants in our study were limited to only those in their 20 s. Therefore, we need to examine whether the findings of our study apply universally across generations in future studies. A pooling organization company (Rakuten Research) conducted a web survey. Two filler items (e.g., please respond to this item as “1”) were assigned during the questionnaire to ensure that participants responded attentively and accurately. Data were collected from 296 participants (159 females, M age = 25.6, Range = 20–29 years old, SD = 2.8) who provided informed consent before the experiment and correctly responded to the filler item. Studies examining procrastination by generation have reported that the degree of procrastination varies by age, with younger people being more likely to procrastinate. For this reason, this study focused on people in their 20s2,26. The experiment was approved by the research ethics committee of the University of Tokyo and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (approval number: 571–22). Procrastination level was assessed using 12 items from the Japanese version of the Pure Procrastination Scale8,27. At the beginning of the session, the participants were instructed to think about how much each item applied to their main activities, such as schoolwork and work. Example items are “I am continually saying “I'll do it tomorrow.”” and “I often find myself performing tasks that I had intended to do days before.” Participants’ responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 1 = “very seldom or not true of me” to 5 = “very often true of true of me”). The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.94. Stress and subjective well-being levels at various time points in the past, present, and future were obtained using the 9-point method (ranging from 1 = ""not at all"" to 9 = ""extremely strong""). Most previous studies asked questions on stress and well-being by specifying a single time axis, for example, ""Please think of the past month."" In this study, however, the questions were asked along nine-time axes: ""the past 10 years,"" ""the past year,"" ""the past month,"" ""yesterday,"" ""now,"" ""tomorrow,"" ""the next month,"" ""the next 1 year,"" and ""the next 10 years.”(Example questions: ""How stressed have you felt in the past 10 years?”, “How happy do you feel now?”, “How stressed do you think you will feel in the next year?”) The stress and well-being values obtained from these questions were arranged chronologically on the time axis and defined as the chronological stress view and chronological well-being view, respectively (see Fig.5for examples). The definitions of stress and well-being were written at the beginning of the questions to share the images of ""stress"" and ""well-being"" among the participants as much as possible. Stress was defined based on the Perceived Stress Scale28,29, and well-being was defined based on Subjective Well-being30,31. The specific description is as follows. Examples of the chronological stress view, chronological well-being view, The x-axis shows, from left to right, past 10 years, past 1 year, past 1 month, yesterday, now, tomorrow, next 1 month, next 1 year, and next 10 years. The y-axis shows (A) stress or (B) well-being when asked on the x-axis time axis. (A) Example A represents “flat type,” indicating that the value does not change depending on the time axis. (B) Example B represents “ascending type,” indicating that the value increases as they move from the past to the present and into the future. In the following questions, ""stress"" and ""well-being"" are defined as follows. Stress: Feeling a burden beyond your ability to cope with or feeling that your situation is unpredictable and beyond your control. Well-being: To feel that. - you are having warm and trusting relationships with others. - you find purpose, meaning, and goals in your life. - you recognize the multiple aspects of self and possess positive attitude toward the self. - you are self-determined and independent. - you are able to choose and govern your environment. - you are continually growing. Based on the total Pure Procrastination Scale score, the top 25% of procrastinators (N = 70, Mean = 43.90, SD = 57.80) were defined as “severe procrastinators,” the bottom 25% of procrastination score (N = 88, Mean = 17.18, SD = 8.63) were defined as “low procrastinators,” and the middle 50% of procrastination score (N = 138, Mean = 28.34, SD = 17.13) were defined as “middle procrastinators”. When standardizing the individual data for the chronological stress and well-being views, data from subjects with non-zero variance were standardized as usual (mean = 0, variance = 1), while data from subjects with zero variance were standardized only by setting the mean to zero. We hypothesized that the group that holds thoughts that lead to disregard for the future (i.e., stress increases as one moves into the future and well-being decreases as one moves into the future) would be more likely to be severe procrastinators. To test this hypothesis, chronological stress/well-being views were subjected to cluster analysis and classified into several groups based on temporal characteristics, and the proportions of severe procrastinators, middle procrastinators, and low procrastinators in each group were compared. If our hypothesis is correct, we would expect to find that the groups who believe that stress will decrease in the future and well-being will increase in the future, i.e., those who have an optimistic view of the future, would have a lower percentage of severe procrastinators or a higher percentage of low procrastinators. Also, the group that believes that stress will increase in the future and the group that believes that well-being will decrease in the future, i.e., the group that has a pessimistic view of the future, should have a higher percentage of severe procrastinators or a lower percentage of low procrastinators. To test this hypothesis, the proportions of the severe procrastinators (top 25% procrastination score), middle procrastinators (middle 50%), and low procrastinators (bottom 25%) for each group classified by cluster analysis were calculated and compared using a chi-square test and a residual analysis. In this study, we introduced new measures, the chronological stress view and chronological well-being view, and examined their relationship with procrastination. First, we found that the overall mean of chronological stress and chronological well-being views depicted a V-shape, with the present moment as the lowest value. Further analysis showed that the proportion of severe procrastinators was lower in the group that thought stress would not increase in the future (descending type). No relationship was found between chronological well-being and procrastination. These results suggest that people with optimistic thoughts about the future are less likely to be severe procrastinators.

While procrastinators often admonish themselves for their “bad habit,” it turns out that their worries for the future are more to blame. Through a survey of nearly 300 young people, researchers found that those who had a positive view about their stress levels decreasing in the future, compared to the past or present, were less likely to experience severe procrastination. Views on personal well-being didn’t appear to have an effect. Improving people’s outlook and readiness for the future could help them overcome procrastination and achieve a less stressful lifestyle.
How many times have you made a “to do” list, and although the most important task is at the top, you seem to be working your way up from the bottom or distracted by something else entirely? While we might chide ourselves for procrastinating, sometimes the more we try to overcome it, the more stressed we feel and the cycle continues. That is how it was for graduate student Saya Kashiwakura from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Tokyo, so she decided to investigate why.
“I have struggled with procrastination since childhood. I would clean my room when I needed to study for a test and prioritize aikido practice over my postgraduate research. This habit of putting off important tasks has been a constant challenge,” said Kashiwakura. “I wanted to change my behavior, as I realized that I was not confronting the future impact of my actions.”
This inspired Kashiwakura to examine the relationship between procrastination and the procrastinator's perspective on time, particularly their view of the future. When she began researching procrastination, she was surprised to discover that many more people suffer from it than she had imagined and found it reassuring her problems were not unique.
The researchers surveyed 296 participants in Japan in their 20s for their views on stress and well-being, and importantly how these changed over time. This included asking about their experiences from 10 years in the past through to the present, and their expectations for 10 years in the future. From the results, participants were clustered into one of four groups (for example, if they thought their situation would improve or would stay the same), and then each group was divided into severe, middle and low procrastinators.
“Our research showed that optimistic people — those who believe that stress does not increase as we move into the future — are less likely to have severe procrastination habits,” explained Kashiwakura. “This finding helped me adopt a more light-hearted perspective on the future, leading to a more direct view and reduced procrastination.”
It was not only the level of stress people experienced, but how their perception of it changed over the 20-year time period discussed, which influenced their procrastination habits. Surprisingly, a relationship wasn’t found between procrastination and negative views on well-being, such as one’s attitude towards oneself, or not yet finding purpose and goals in life.
Using these results, the team wants to develop ways to help people nurture a more optimistic mindset and overcome procrastination. “We hope our findings will be particularly useful in the education sector. We believe that students will achieve better outcomes and experience greater well-being when they can comprehend their procrastination tendencies scientifically, and actively work on improving them, rather than blaming themselves,” said Kashiwakura.
“Thoughts can change with just a few minutes of watching a video or be shaped by years of accumulation. Our next step is to investigate which approach is appropriate this time, and how we can develop the ‘right’ mindset to lead a happier and more fulfilling life.”

Specifically, this study examines the sizes and travel distances of internal displacements based on GPS human mobility data, using the combinations of mobility pattern estimation methods such as truncated power law fitting and visualizing the results for humanitarian operations. Our analysis reveals that, although the city of Kyiv started to lose its population around 5 weeks before the invasion, a significant drop happened in the second week of the invasion (4.3 times larger than the size of the population lost in 5 weeks before the invasion), and the population coming to the city increased again from the third week of the invasion, indicating that displaced people started to back to their homes. Meanwhile, adjacent southern areas of Kyiv and the areas close to the western borders experienced many migrants from the first week of the invasion and from the second to third weeks of the invasion, respectively. In addition, people from relatively higher-wealth areas tended to relocate their home locations far away from their original locations compared to those from other areas. For example, 19 % of people who originally lived in higher wealth areas in the North region, including the city of Kyiv, moved their home location more than 500 km, while only 9 % of those who originally lived in lower wealth areas in the North region moved their home location more than 500 km. Forcibly displaced populations, such as refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons (IDPs), have drastically grown in the past decades due to war, poverty, and political and environmental factors, among others. According to the United Nations1, there were approximately 89 million of such population worldwide at the end of 2021, and IDPs were among the largest portion, 53.2 million people. As forcibly displaced populations face numerous challenges when seeking safety and security in new locations, the mobility patterns of IDPs have important implications for humanitarian response and policy makings. By understanding how IDPs move and where they go, aid organizations, local governments, and local communities can better distribute their resources and services. However, according to the United Nations2, many instances of internal displacement remain unrecorded. The absence or poor quality of data can leave hundreds of thousands of people without access to appropriate protection and assistance2. This led the United Nations to call for data and analysis to be conducted to recognize the realities of internal displacement and ensure durable solutions2. In the past decade, the efforts to utilize human mobility GPS data for crises have been expanded. This includes measuring environmental exposure3, democratic participation (e.g., voter turnout4), disaster management (e.g., population displacement), and public health (e.g., spreads of diseases and non-pharmaceutical interventions for a pandemic5,6,7,8,9,10,11). Various studies have revealed that human movement is regular and predictable in normal times while some socio-economic and geographical variations exists12,13,14,15. On the other hand, despite massive efforts to leverage human mobility data collected from mobile phones for humanitarian aid, there has been less research on how human mobility data can aid IDPs. Move-out versus move-in population sizes of each oblast in each week (see section “Method”). In Panel (a), oblasts are colored redder(bluer) when a larger population moves into (out from) the oblasts relative to the moving-out (moving-in) population. 2022-Week-8 is when the invasion started. Panel (b) plots each week’s move-out versus move-in population for each oblast. In the case of the IDPs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) conducted telephone interviews in the early stages of the conflict16. In addition, scholars have leveraged social media data and satellite images to estimate displaced population movements17,18,19. Our analysis expands the previous efforts of IDP flow analysis by developing and showcasing a framework for tracking and visualizing up-to-date displaced population flows with fine-grained smartphone GPS data. Because one of the challenges of humanitarian aid with data is providing an up-to-date situation for the humanitarian stakeholders when they need the most20,21, our result visualizations can be used as basic information to detect areas with high humanitarian needs and assist the affected population. Furthermore, our analysis revealed correlations between socioeconomic levels and travel distances of IDPs. Because people’s decisions to relocate their settlements can depend on various socioeconomic factors, including access to transportation, finances, health, and family circumstances, among others, future research should keep investigate more on the drivers and barriers of displacements to support vulnerable populations when they need the help most. Estimated sizes of moving-out and moving-in populations of each oblast, where x-axis represents the number of people moving out from and y-axis represents the number of people moving in an area. The larger circles indicate larger population flows (sum of the both moving in and out). If a circle is on the dashed red line, which represents the linear line of\(y=x\), it indicates that an oblast has an equal size of moving in and out populations. The grey solid line represents the regression line of the estimated moving out and moving in values. The estimated coefficients and correlation are shown in the upper right of each plot. In-country human mobility connectivity among oblasts. Panel (a) shows the connectivity before the invasion (January of 2022), while Panel (bshows those during the invasion (from February 24 to March 31 in 2022). The arrows represent the human mobility directions. Note that the connectivity of oblasts with less than 10 times occurrences and the connectivity with outsider Ukraine nor unknown places were removed from these plots. Estimated displaced population flow from the city of Kyiv. The bar heights represent the size of the population leaving oblasts and moving into oblasts. Note that the flows to “Unknown and Outside Ukraine” are, in particular, unclear because our datasets do not cover the flows outside Ukraine well. Building upon the previous efforts to improve situational awareness with human mobility data, this study explores how IDPs’ initial occurrences can be captured with human mobility datasets by exploring the case of IDPs in Ukraine at the beginning of the Russian Invasion in 2022. To better understand human movements during the invasion, we use mobility containing periodic location updates containing timestamped geolocations (latitude, longitude, and time) provided by Outlogic (see section “Data description”). This dataset covers the period from January 1st to March 31st 2022 in Ukraine. We confine target populations to those who were in Ukraine in January 2022 and analyze their changes in every week’s home locations for a 3 month period that covers the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (February 24th, 2022). The data comprises over 9 million geographical records from over 139,761 unique anonymous users who opted in to share their location data anonymously (see section “Data description”). In this paper, we focus onsizesanddistancesof internal displacements for the purpose of providing an initial assessment of IDP patterns. After checking our datasets’ data representativeness and overall quality from three perspectives (geolocation, time, and socioeconomic attributes) inSupplementary Material, we corrected our data with scaling factors based on the Ukraine population data of 2020 inSupplementary Material). We first estimate the sizes of the moving-in and the moving-out populations at the region level weekly by using a metric that identifies unusual patterns in the ratios of move-in and move-out population sizes to account for the lack of historical data in our datasets (see section “Method”). Secondly, we estimate each displaced person’s distance from the original home locations and check the variances of displacement distances with the truncated power law. Using the truncated power law model, we can capture the variance of human mobility patterns within and among regions, helping us understand geographical and socioeconomic differences in human mobility patterns (see section “Method”). To understand the overall flow sizes of the internally displaced persons, we estimate weekly home locations at the oblast level (see section “Method”), and then calculate each oblast’s relative move-in population by calculating the number of moving-in populations divided by the sum number of moving-out and moving-in populations per week (Fig.1andSupplementary Material). We consider the population who moved home location from an oblast to another oblast or unknown places including outside of the country as the move-out population while those who moved home location from another oblast to the oblast as the move-in population. In Fig.1Panel a, oblasts are colored redder when a larger population moves into the oblasts than moving-out population; oblasts are colored bluer when larger populations move out compared to moving-in populations. From the second week of 2022 (January 9th–15th, 5 weeks before the invasion started), the move-out populations were larger than the move-in populations in all oblast except the city of Kyiv. The east region’s oblasts had a larger move-out population even several weeks before the invasion started. When the invasion started (2022-Week-8), the divergence in the balance of oblasts’ move-in and move-out became larger. The city of Kyiv experienced a larger gap in move-out population relative to the move-in population, and Zakarpatska oblast experienced a larger move-in population compared to the move-out population (Fig.1). To further check the absolute sizes of the displaced populations of each oblast, Fig.2shows the scatter plot of the size of the population moving in (y-axis) and those moving out (x-axis). The population sizes of moving-in and moving-out started to become divergent around 2022-Week-8, while 2022-Week-9 (the following week of the invasion start) was the most divergent in the population flows. Some oblasts have lost much population (e.g., Kyiv, Kharikivska, Odeska, Donestska) while others have hosted more new populations, including Zakarpatska and Lvivska. The findings are consistent with previous research conducted on social media data17,18. They discovered that there were massive evacuations of major cities in the first few weeks of the conflict and that displaced persons moved from east to west during this time. In addition, to understand from and to where people moved in Ukraine, we created the displacement networks of oblasts by calculating the summed size of the displacement networkDquantifies the number of trips from regionitoj, recorded within a weekly time frame (\(D_t^{ij}\)). We created the aggregated sub-datasets consisting of the weekly home locations and plotted the displacement network flow of each sub-dataset (Fig.3). To understand the case of population flows of Kyiv, Fig.4depicts the weekly displacement patterns among the persons whose estimated original home location was in Kyiv as of January 2022. This figure helps us grasp where the population moves weekly. According to Fig.4, it appears that a certain portion of individuals frequently relocate their place of residence, while others remain in a single oblast. Note that the sizes of populations moving out outside Ukraine are possibly unreliable in our findings due to the lack of data coverage in the neighboring countries in our dataset. Travel distance trends. Panel (a) shows the geographical distributions of socioeconomic levels, Relative Wealth Index (RWI) (see section “Method”). ‘RWI Higher’: mean RWI\(\ge 0.5\), ‘Middle RWI’: mean RWI\(< 0.5\)and\(> 0\), ‘Lower RWI’: mean RWI\(\le\)0). Panel (b–d) shows the estimated\(\alpha\)-values of truncated power law fittings (\(p(x) \propto x^{-\alpha }e^{-\lambda x}\)). 95 % percentile of mean values of estimated\(\alpha\)with bootstrapping method are shown. A smaller\(\alpha\)value signifies a more fat-tailed distribution, indicating larger differences in travel distances among populations. In other words, a smaller\(\alpha\)indicates greater variation in travel distances. Panel (e) shows cumulative density distributions of travel distances of internal displacements for the whole dataset. In addition to estimating the sizes of displaced populations shown above, we now shift our focus to examining the travel distances of internally displaced people. We assume that the travel distances of internally displaced persons may vary among individuals, depending on factors such as their original home locations, conditions in their surrounding areas and transportation accesses, and individual socioeconomic circumstances20,21,22,23,24. In this study, we compare travel distances among original home locations and regional socioeconomic levels by using the Relative Wealth Index (RWI) provided by Meta (see section “Method”). Typically, it is known that the frequency of human movement has been characterized as following a power law, wherein the probability of human movement decreases when the travel distance increases. These trends have been widely observed internationally, mainly during normal times12,14,15,25and similar trends have been reported during emergencies, such as evacuation flows from disasters and during the pandemic9,26. Building upon previous research on human mobility in various countries, we employ a truncated power law with an exponential cutoff,\(p(x) \propto x^{-\alpha }e^{-\lambda x}\)).\(\alpha\)is the scaling parameter and\(\lambda\)is the parameter of the exponential distribution. To verify the applicability of the truncated power law model for our dataset, we conducted the statistical test for checking the goodness of fit for the internal displacement flows in Ukraine (see section “Method”). The results indicated that the all week data at the country level follows the truncated power law distribution, and a majority of the macro-region level sub-dataset and RWI level sub-datasets also exhibit this pattern. Consequently, we decided to use the truncated power law for all datasets. To estimate the scaling parameter (\(\alpha\)), we employed a non-parametric bootstrapping method. A smaller\(\alpha\)value signifies a more fat-tailed distribution, indicating larger differences in travel distances among populations. In other words, a smaller\(\alpha\)indicates greater variation in travel distances. Panel b–d in Fig.5presents the estimated\(\alpha\)values for the weekly travel distances from the original home location. The results demonstrate that\(\alpha\)values did not abruptly decline at the onset of the invasion. Instead, they gradually decreased from six weeks prior to the invasion. From 2022-Week-1 to 2022-Week-7 (before the beginning of the invasion), the estimated\(\alpha\)-values are between 2 and around 3 (Panel b in Fig.5). These values are comparable to those reported in previous studies analyzing human mobility data15, where the means scaling parameters (\(\alpha\)) ranged from 1.80 in higher socio-economic areas to 2.54 in lower socio-economic areas. In the case of Ukraine, the estimated\(\alpha\)value started to eclipse below 2 around the beginning of the invasion and experienced the sharpest decline in 2022-Week-9 (1 week after the beginning of the invasion). Subsequently, the\(\alpha\)values remained low until the end of March 2022. Movement patterns were heterogeneous both under normal conditions, echoing results of previous human mobility studies during the crisis26,27,28. However, in the case of Ukraine, this heterogeneity became more pronounced following the onset of the invasion compared to normal times. When fitting the truncated power law to each RWI level group, we observed the largest drop in the estimated\(\alpha\)values among the population originating from higher RWI areas (Panel c in Fig.5). Conversely, the population from the middle and lower RWI areas experienced relatively moderate declines in the\(\alpha\)values. This may be attributed to the higher perceived risks and the need to flee from the original locations among individuals in higher RWI areas, as well as their greater resources and capabilities to do so. Furthermore, we examined the distances to the western borders as a potential driver of people’s displacements by analyzing each macro-region displacement pattern and implementing the truncated power law fitting (Panel d–e in Fig.5. The findings revealed that while displacement travel distance patterns vary between macro-regions, (Panel d in Fig.5), they also differ within the same region depending on socioeconomic levels (Panel e in Fig.5). This study aims to improve the empirical understanding and immediate assessment of mobility patterns of internally displaced persons (IDPs) using human mobility data. With our proposed framework of analyzing and visualizing GPS human mobility data, we identified overall trends in internal displacement patterns while highlighting their heterogeneous characteristics. Our framework has the potential to be applicable in areas lacking historical human mobility data, facilitating immediate assessments even during a crisis. In addition, we observed that individuals from higher-wealth areas tended to relocate their locations far away from their original locations compared to those from other areas. Based on our results, we recommend further analysis of the heterogeneity of displacements as well as the drivers and obstacles behind displacement. In particular, given that not everyone can flee from crisis-affected places and those who are most vulnerable are usually poor29, investigating how different types of exposure to a crisis affect human behavior is crucial. We believe that our methods can serve as an immediate situational check of IDPs. Nonetheless, for long-term aid for IDPs, more comprehensive and detailed analysis, as well as addressing potential data biases in human mobility data will be critical to fully utilize human mobility data benefits13,30,31,32,33,34,35. To better understand human movements before and during the invasion, we use mobility containing periodic location updates containing timestamped geolocation (latitude, longitude, and time) provided by a provider of location data, Outlogic. We used the data collected in Ukraine from January 1st, 2022, to April 3rd, 2022, which covers the days from 6 weeks before the Russian invasion started (February 24th of 2022) (seeSupplementary Material). We first apply a home detection method to location data points to infer weekly home locations per user. Specifically, we consider the most frequently occurring location (aggregated at a hexagonal grid, H3 indexing system resolution 5,https://h3geo.org/) per user per week from 9 pm to 5 am as the user’s home location at the oblast level. To ensure data quality and reduce privacy concerns, we only use aggregated levels of home location data in the analysis. The representativeness of the data has been tested and corrected with a scaling factor to reduce potential biases in our dataset (seeSupplementary Material). We use the oblast-level shape data provided by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (https://data.humdata.org/). The population of each oblast and H3 grid was calculated using the population distribution data sets from WorldPop (https://www.worldpop.org/). The estimated weekly home locations are used to track how the population changed their home locations before and during the invasion. Considering the geographical representativeness of the data, the volume of people displaced from Kyiv to other areas has been plotted in Fig.4, where the vertical length of bars represents the population volume. To understand the overall in-country displacement flows, we also use all oblast data to create the chord diagram in Fig.2, where the weekly home locations are aggregated before and during the invasion time frame. In the chord diagram, we show the summed size of the displacement networkDquantifies the number of trips from regionitoj, recorded within a weekly time frame (\(D_t^{ij}\)). The absolute size of the population moving into oblasts and the size of the population moving from oblasts are compared to understand the displacement trends (Fig.1). We calculate the relative volume of the population moving in and out from oblasts,\(RM_i^t\); whereirepresent oblasti, andtrepresents weekt,\(I_i^t\)is the frequency of moving into the oblastiin a weekt, and\(O_i^t\)is the frequency of moving out from the oblastiin a weekt. This simple metric can capture the relative frequency of population displacements at the oblast level. When\(RM_i^t\)is close to 0.5, the frequency of occurrence of moving-in and moving-out is relatively similar. The frequency of occurrence of moving-in is higher when\(RM_i^t\)is close to 1, while the frequency of occurrence of moving-out is higher when\(RM_i^t\)is close to 0. In addition to the size of the internally displaced population, we focus on the distance of internal displacement. Many human travel patterns have generally been known to follow the power law: in general, the probability of traveling to an area far away from one’s neighboring areas decreases with distance36. This trend is also observed in the human displacement patterns after a disruption in the areas37. By following previous human movement studies12,15,38, we use a simple model, the truncated power law, to fit the population’s home location change patterns. With the maximum travel distances per person, we fit the following truncated power law with an exponential cutoff, where a probability densityp(x): where\(\alpha\)is a constant scaling parameter and\(\alpha >1\).\(\lambda\)is the parameter of the exponential distribution. We use a maximum-likelihood fitting method with a goodness-of-fit test based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and likelihood ratio. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is measured as the maximum distance between the empirical cumulative density function and the best-fit distribution’s cumulative density function. We also estimate the lower bound\(x_{min}\)from which the data follow a power law, because, empirical data on human mobility, the data may only follow a power law from a lower bound\(x_{min}\). We estimate the scaling parameter by numerically optimizing the log-likelihood. where\(x_i\),\(i = 1 \, \ldots \, n\)are the observed values of x such that\(x_{i} \ge x_{min}\). We apply Eq. (2) to the dataset of each week and estimate the weekly scaling parameter (\(\alpha\), Fig.5). Even if our data are well fit by a power law, another distribution, such as an exponential or a log-normal, might still fit as well or better39. To ensure the validity of fitting the power law model, we compare the power law with alternative hypotheses via a likelihood ratio test, including exponential distribution. For each alternative, if the calculated likelihood ratio is significantly different from zero, then its sign indicates whether the alternative is favored over the power-law model or not. To quantify the parameter uncertainty of the scaling parameter, we make use of the non-parametric bootstrap method. We drew points 999 times at random with replacement and estimated\(x_{min}\)and\(\alpha\)for each drawn dataset. By using the bootstrap method, the determination of displacement population sizes does not rely on any assumption of the statistical distribution. Another advantage of using the bootstrap method is the simplicity of implementation. This method enhances the applicability of population size estimations by relaxing the normality assumption. Whether a person can travel to secure places may depend on her geographical and socio-economic factors, including the accessibility to public transport, car owenership, finances and family situation. To capture such heterogeneity of travel patterns, we compare the distance from the displaced population’s original home location to the settled location with available geographical and socioeconomic attribute data (Fig.5). Finally, we compare travel distance with the Relative Wealth Index. Because oblast is too broad to capture RWI’s geographical heterogeneousness, we use locations’ average RWI at the Hexigon area (H3, resolution 5). Human mobility data are only available for the current study. Geographic data (https://data.humdata.org/), population of each oblast (https://www.worldpop.org/) and Relative Wealth Index (RWI) provided by Meta (https://dataforgood.facebook.com/dfg/tools/relative-wealth-index) are publically accessible.

Accurate data about the locations and movements of affected people in these situations is essential for this. Researchers from the University of Tokyo, working with the World Bank, have produced a framework to analyze and visualize population mobility data, which could help in such cases.
Wars, famines, outbreaks, natural disasters … There are, sadly, many reasons why populations might be forced or feel compelled to leave their homes in search of refuge elsewhere, and these cases continue to grow.The United Nations estimated in 2023that there were over 100 million forcibly displaced people in the world. Over 62 million of these individuals are considered internally displaced people (IDPs), those in particularly vulnerable situations due to being stuck within the borders of their countries, from which they might be trying to flee.
The circumstances that displace populations are inevitably chaotic and certainly, but not exclusively, in cases of conflict, information infrastructure can be impeded. So, authorities and agencies trying to get a handle on crises are often operating with limited data on the people they are trying to help. But the lack of data alone is not the only problem; being able to easily interpret data, so that nonexperts can make effective decisions based on it, is also an issue, especially in rapidly evolving situations where the stakes, and tensions, are high.
“It’s practically impossible to provide aid agencies and others with accurate real time data on affected populations. The available data will often be too fragmented to be useful directly,” said Associate Professor Yuya Shibuya from the Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies. “There have been many efforts to use GPS data for such things, and in normal situations, it has been shown to be useful to model population behavior. But in times of crisis, patterns of predictability break down and the quality of data decreases. As data scientists, we explore ways to mitigate these problems and have developed a tracking framework for monitoring population movements by studying IDPs displaced in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.”
Even though Ukraine has good enough network coverage throughout to acquire GPS data, the data generated is not representative of the entire population. There are also privacy concerns, and likely other significant gaps in data due to the nature of conflict itself. As such, it’s no trivial task to model the way populations move. Shibuya and her team had access to a limited dataset which covered the period a few weeks before and a few weeks after the initial invasion on Feb. 24, 2022. This data contained over 9 million location records from over 100,000 anonymous IDPs who opted in to share their location data.
“From these records, we could estimate people’s home locations at the regional level based on regular patterns in advance of the invasion. To make sure this limited data could be used to represent the entire population, we compared our estimates to survey data from the International Organization for Migration of the U.N.,” said Shibuya. “From there, we looked at when and where people moved just prior to and for some time after the invasion began. The majority of IDPs were from the capital, Kyiv, and some people left as early as five weeks before Feb. 24, perhaps in anticipation, though it was two weeks after that day that four times as many people left. However, a week later still, there was evidence some people started to return.”
That some people return to afflicted areas is just one factor that confounds population mobility models — in actual fact, people may move between locations, sometimes multiple times. Trying to represent this with a simple map with arrows to show populations could get cluttered fast. Shibuya’s team used color-coded charts to visualize its data, which allow you to see population movements in and out of regions at different times, or dynamic data, in a single image.
“I want visualizations like these to help humanitarian agencies gauge how to allocate human resources and physical resources like food and medicine. As they tell you about dynamic changes in populations, not just A to B movements, I think it could mean aid gets to where it’s needed and when it’s needed more efficiently, reducing waste and overheads,” said Shibuya. “Another thing we found that could be useful is that people’s migration patterns vary, and socioeconomic status seems to be a factor in this. People from more affluent areas tended to move farther from their homes than others. There is demographic diversity and good simulations ought to reflect this diversity and not make too many assumptions.”
The team worked with the World Bank on this study, as the international organization could provide the data necessary for the analyses. They hope to look into other kinds of situations too, such as natural disasters, political conflicts, environmental issues and more. Ultimately, by performing research like this, Shibuya hopes to produce better general models of human behavior in crisis situations in order to alleviate some of the impacts those situations can create.

Researchers from Japan, China and Finland created a system which replaces parts of images that might threaten confidentiality with visually similar but AI-generated alternatives. Named “generative content replacement,” in tests, 60% of viewers couldn’t tell which images had been altered. The researchers intend for this system to provide a more visually cohesive option for image censoring, which helps to preserve the narrative of the image while protecting privacy. This research was presented at the Association for Computing Machinery’s CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the U.S., in May 2024.
With just a few text prompts, generative AI can offer a quick fix for a tricky school essay, a new business strategy or endless meme fodder. The advent of generative AI into daily life has been swift, and the potential scale of its role and influence are still being grappled with. Fears over its impact on future job security, online safety and creative originality have led to strikes from Hollywood writers, court cases over faked photos and heated discussions about authenticity.
However, a team of researchers has proposed using a sometimes controversial feature of generative AI – its ability to manipulate images – as a way to solve privacy issues.
“We found that the existing image privacy protection techniques are not necessarily able to hide information while maintaining image aesthetics. Resulting images can sometimes appear unnatural or jarring. We considered this a demotivating factor for people who might otherwise consider applying privacy protection,” explained Associate Professor Koji Yatani from the Graduate School of Engineering at the University of Tokyo. “So, we decided to explore how we can achieve both — that is, robust privacy protection and image useability — at the same time by incorporating the latest generative AI technology.”
The researchers created a computer system which they named generative content replacement (GCR). This tool identifies what might constitute a privacy threat and automatically replaces it with a realistic but artificially created substitute. For example, personal information on a ticket stub could be replaced with illegible letters, or a private building exchanged for a fake building or other landscape features.
“There are a number of commonly used image protection methods, such as blurring, color filling or just removing the affected part of the image. Compared to these, our results show that generative content replacement can better maintain the story of the original images and higher visual harmony,” said Yatani. “We found that participants couldn’t detect GCR in 60% of images.”
For now, the GCR system requires a lot of computation resources, so it won’t be available on any personal devices just yet. The tested system was fully automatic, but the team has since developed a new interface to allow users to customize images, giving more control over the final outcome.
Although some may be concerned about the risks of this type of realistic image alteration, where the lines between original and altered imagery become more ambiguous, the team is positive about its advantages. “For public users, we believe that the greatest benefit of this research is providing a new option for image privacy protection,” said Yatani. “GCR offers a novel method for protecting against privacy threats, while maintaining visual coherence for storytelling purposes and enabling people to more safely share their content.”

The case of the missing black holes,"Primordial black holes can be formed from the collapse of large-amplitude perturbation on small scales in the early Universe. Such an enhanced spectrum can be realized by introducing a flat region in the potential of single-field inflation, which makes the inflaton go into a temporary ultraslow-roll period. In this paper, we calculate the bispectrum of curvature perturbation in such a scenario. We explicitly confirm that bispectrum satisfies Maldacena’s theorem. At the end of the ultraslow-roll period, the bispectrum is generated by bulk interaction and field redefinition. At the end of inflation, bispectrum is generated only by bulk interaction. We also calculate the one-loop correction to the power spectrum from the bispectrum, called the source method. We find it consistent with the calculation of the one-loop correction from the second-order expansion of in-in perturbation theory.

Their exploration led to the conclusion that there ought to be far fewer miniature black holes than most models suggest, though observations to confirm this should soon be possible. The specific kind of black hole in question could be a contender for dark matter.
The study of the universe can be a daunting thing, so let’s make sure we’re all on the same page. Though details are fuzzy, the general consensus amongst physicists is that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old, began with a bang, expanded rapidly in a period called inflation, and somewhere along the line went from being homogenous to containing detail and structure. Most of the universe is empty, but despite this, it appears to be significantly heavier than can be explained by what we can see — we call this discrepancy dark matter, and no one knows what this might be, but evidence is building that it might be black holes, specifically old ones.
“We call them primordial black holes (PBH), and many researchers feel they are a strong candidate for dark matter, but there would need to be plenty of them to satisfy that theory,” said graduate student Jason Kristiano. “They are interesting for other reasons too, as since the recent innovation of gravitational wave astronomy, there have been discoveries of binary black hole mergers, which can be explained if PBHs exist in large numbers. But despite these strong reasons for their expected abundance, we have not seen any directly, and now we have a model which should explain why this is the case.”
Kristiano and his supervisor, Professor Jun’ichi Yokoyama, presently the director of Kavli IPMU and RESCEU, have extensively explored the various models for PBH formation, but found that the leading contenders do not align with actual observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is sort of like a leftover fingerprint from the Big Bang explosion marking the beginning of the universe. And if something disagrees with solid observations, it either cannot be true or can only paint part of a picture at best. In this case, the team used a novel approach to correct the leading model of PBH formation from cosmic inflation so it better aligns with current observations and could be further verified with upcoming observations by terrestrial gravitational wave observatories around the world.
“At the beginning, the universe was incredibly small, much smaller than the size of a single atom. Cosmic inflation rapidly expanded that by 25 orders of magnitude. At that time, waves traveling through this tiny space could have had relatively large amplitudes but very short wavelengths. What we have found is that these tiny but strong waves can translate to otherwise inexplicable amplification of much longer waves we see in the present CMB,” said Yokoyama. “We believe this is due to occasional instances of coherence between these early short waves, which can be explained using quantum field theory, the most robust theory we have to describe everyday phenomena such as photons or electrons. While individual short waves would be relatively powerless, coherent groups would have the power to reshape waves much larger than themselves. This is a rare instance of where a theory of something at one extreme scale seems to explain something at the opposite end of the scale.”
If, as Kristiano and Yokoyama suggest, early small-scale fluctuations in the universe do affect some of the larger-scale fluctuations we see in the CMB, it might alter the standard explanation of coarse structures in the universe. But also, given we can use measurements of wavelengths in the CMB to effectively constrain the extent of corresponding wavelengths in the early universe, it necessarily constrains any other phenomena that might rely on these shorter, stronger wavelengths. And this is where the PBHs come back in.
“It is widely believed that the collapse of short but strong wavelengths in the early universe is what creates primordial black holes,” said Kristiano. “Our study suggests there should be far fewer PBHs than would be needed if they are indeed a strong candidate for dark matter or gravitational wave events.”
At the time of writing, the world’s gravitational wave observatories, LIGO in the U.S., Virgo in Italy and KAGRA in Japan, are in the midst of an observation mission which aims to observe the first small black holes, likely PBHs. In any case, the results should offer the team solid evidence to help them refine their theory further.

Based on a human paradigm, we presented illusory drifting gratings to mice. Primary visual cortex (V1) neurons responded to illusory gratings, matching their direction selectivity for real gratings, and they tracked the spatial phase offset between illusory and real gratings. Illusion responses were delayed compared to real gratings, in line with the theory that processing illusions requires feedback from higher visual areas (HVAs). We provide support for this theory by showing a reduced V1 response to illusions, but not real gratings, following HVAs optogenetic inhibition. Finally, we used the pupil response (PR) as an indirect perceptual report and showed that the mouse PR matches the human PR to perceived luminance changes. Our findings resolve debates over whether V1 neurons are involved in processing illusions and highlight the involvement of feedback from HVAs. Non-human primate and cat V1 single cells respond to physical brightness1,2,3,4,5,6, but whether V1 single cells respond to illusory brightness is controversial7,8. For instance, it has been reported that V1 neurons in monkeys respond to real surface luminance, but not to illusory brightness7, and one study in cats reported single neuron responses to illusory brightness in both V1 and V2 but found much higher prevalence in V28. Moreover, fMRI studies in humans have been inconclusive, with some studies reporting a correlation between V1 BOLD signal and perception of illusory brightness9,10,11, while others found no such correlation12,13,14. Thus, the V1 neuronal response to illusory brightness is uncertain in humans and animals15,16,17,18. In the present study, using in vivo electrophysiology in mouse V1, we probe the neural correlates of an achromatic version of neon color spreading (NCS)19,20, an illusion that has been shown in humans to combine different perceptual qualities, such as filling-in and perception of illusory contours and brightness21. We show that single units recorded in mouse V1 respond to NCS stimuli designed to generate an illusory drifting grating. Neuronal responses were compared with a physical drifting grating in antiphase relative to the illusory grating. Analyzing the spatial phase tuning properties of single units allowed us to demonstrate that V1 single units respond to illusory brightness as though a real grating was presented. Using this mouse paradigm, we were able to probe the putative neuronal organization of the V1 microcircuit22,23,24,25,26involved in illusory brightness processing by studying the relationship between single unit responses to the illusory stimuli and surround modulation27,28, complex-simple cell modulation29,30,31,32, as well as by characterizing units as putative inhibitory interneurons and putative excitatory pyramidal neurons33,34. A prominent theoretical view is that feedback from higher visual areas (HVAs) is necessary to process illusions35,36. We tested this using optogenetic inhibition of HVAs and showed that disrupting their activity suppresses the V1 single unit response to the illusory brightness. A fundamental challenge in studying visual illusions in animal models is determining whether animals can”perceive” illusions without a language-based system for reporting subjective experiences. Pupillometry has been used to infer perceptual experiences of brightess illusions in humans, as well as in rats, and is a promising method to infer perceptual experience in pre-linguistic humans (e.g., babies)37,38,39,40,41. Here, we used pupillometry in mice as an indirect behavioral response of perception. We found that the illusory brightness evokes a pupillary response in mice indicative of illusory brightness perception. We performed in vivo electrophysiology on 19 awake, head-fixed mice passively viewing visual stimuli (Fig.1). The mice were positioned on a disk and free to run or remain immobile. Before the experiment, we made two preliminary recordings aimed at locating single unit receptive fields (RFs) and characterizing size tuning. Briefly, we first performed RF mapping to estimate the center of the RF using the multi-unit response to black rectangles (covering 15° of the visual field) presented on a gray background at locations selected in a pseudo-random order from an 8 by 13 grid. Next, we recorded unit responses to circular patches of drifting gratings with different sizes (2.5°−45° coverage of the visual field) and presented them in the center of the RF. These recordings were subsequently used to characterize size tuning. Following these preliminary recordings, we began recording the neuronal responses to the stimuli shown in Fig.1to study whether V1 units respond to illusory brightness. aAn example of the achromatic NCS stimulus presented to mice. The stimulus consists of 9 sets of white concentric circles. Each set of concentric circles contains gray segments at different positions. As can be seen, the gray color is diffusing into the empty area between concentric circles. This generates an illusory grating that appears darker than the surrounding black background. Changing the location of the gray segments on the concentric circles will change the orientation of this illusory grating.bThe schematic shows the physical and perceptual luminance in the four arbitrary areas bounded by red boxes and marked as areas 1, 2, 3, and 4 in panel a. Luminance differences in areas 3 and 4 make an illusory perceptual luminance difference between areas 1 and 2 due to the diffusion of the gray color from area 3 to area 1. The luminance values are arbitrary.cIn the DBC stimulus condition, the concentric circles are constrained by an outer white”band,” which serves to block the diffusion of gray color while maintaining the presentation of the physical stimulus (i.e., the concentric circles).dA control stimulus that provided a real luminance-defined grating (LDG) was used to compare an actual grating with the illusory grating evoked by the NCS illusion in panel a. This grating was presented over a background compound of a steady concentric circle with a temporal and spatial frequency identical to the illusory grating generated by the NCS stimulus. The green ellipse shows an example of a V1 RF for comparing its size relative to the stimuli. We presented three types of stimuli, either with a full-screen size (covering 130.7° of the visual field) or centered on the RF (covering 35° of the visual field). The first stimulus type was an achromatic version of the NCS stimulus21(Fig.1aand Supplementary Fig.1a). This stimulus consisted of an array of white concentric circles presented on a black background. Each of the concentric circles in the array contains gray segments at different positions. These gray segments are aligned in a way that diffusion of gray color into the background produces an illusory grating that seems darker than the surrounding black background. Depending on which segments of the concentric circles are gray, the orientation of the illusory grating changes. Gray segments were introduced at distinct positions in each time frame, which produced an illusory grating that drifts (Supplementary Movie1). The second and third types of stimuli were control conditions. The diffusion-blocked control (DBC) stimulus (Fig.1cand Supplementary Fig.1b) had identical temporal dynamics to the NCS stimulus. However, each concentric circle was constrained by two static circles, which led to the extinction of the illusory grating by disrupting the diffusion of brightness (Supplementary Movie2). The DBC stimulus was used to verify that a V1 response to the NCS stimulus was due to the processing of an illusory grating, as opposed to the physical stimulus changes within the RF. The other control stimulus was a luminance-defined grating (LDG), which was a real drifting grating presented in the foreground over the concentric circles (Fig.1d, Supplementary Fig.1c, and Supplementary Movie3). The LDG stimulus had the same spatial and temporal frequency as the illusory grating generated by the NCS stimulus. It served as a control condition in which a physical drifting grating was presented in order to compare the tuning properties of units for illusory gratings (NCS stimuli) with real gratings (LDG stimuli). The same gray color was used in all conditions to have comparable neuronal responses. For all three stimulus types, we presented eight drift directions that were selected in pseudo-random order. The presentation of NCS, DBC, and LDG stimuli was also in a pseudo-randomized order. We analyzed the stimulus-evoked spiking of 520 mouse V1 single units (N= 6 mice). Example responses evoked by the NCS, LDG, and DBC stimuli are shown in Fig.2a, b. Additional examples are presented in Supplementary Fig.2. We found that 57.2% of the units responded to both NCS and LDG stimuli, 39.5% responded to only LDG stimuli, and 3.3% responded to only NCS stimuli (Fig.2c). The magnitude of the response to NCS stimuli was significantly smaller than the response to LDG stimuli (linear mixed-effects model (LMEM):F= 29.34,p= 7.53e-8; Fig.2d). In contrast to the LDG and NCS stimuli, the DBC stimuli did not evoke any response despite its exact pixel-wise changes compared to the NCS stimulus (Fig.2c,e,f). Importantly, the lack of response to the DBC stimuli demonstrates that the NCS response is not due to the local physical changes of stimulus. Moreover, the lack of response to the DBC stimulus is consistent with the illusion being abolished so that no grating (even illusory) was present and able to drive a V1 neuronal response. Thus, V1 single units respond to the NCS stimulus but not when the illusory grating is extinguished in the DBC stimuli. a,bRasters and peri-stimulus time histograms (baseline-subtracted) of two V1 units in response to physical gratings (LDG), illusory gratings (NCS), and diffusion-blocked illusory gratings (DBC) at the preferred direction of each unit (90° and 135°, respectively).

However, it has been shown that locomotion modulates the stimulus-evoked response of visual cortex neurons42,43and it is possible that the NCS response could be due to locomotion. We assessed how running speed affected the V1 unit responses to LDG and NCS stimuli. Consistent with prior studies42,43, stimuli presented during running (i.e., mean running speed of >1 cm/s in a 500 ms window starting 300 ms prior to stimulus onset) evoked a larger response to both NCS and LDG stimuli (Supplementary Fig.3a,b). We defined an illusory grating response (IGR) index that quantifies the preference of units for the NCS stimuli relative to the LDG stimuli. A positive IGR indicates a larger evoked response to the NCS stimulus, whereas a negative value indicates a larger LDG-evoked response (see Methods section, Eq.1). Importantly, we observed that the IGR index did not change in trials with running compared to those without running (LMEM:F= 2.26,p= 0.13; Supplementary Fig.3c). It can, therefore, be ruled out that running altered the preferred stimulus of each unit or that it differentially modulated responses to the LDG and NCS stimuli. The V1 unit response to illusory brightness is not due to locomotion. Since V1 neurons exhibit preferred angles for drifting gratings across species, including mice44,45,46, we reasoned that if mouse V1 units respond to illusory gratings as though they are like gratings that are physically present, then each unit’s preferred angle would be similar for real and illusory gratings. We obtained the preferred angle of each unit using the eight drift directions of the LDG and NCS stimuli. The preferred angle was defined as the drift direction that evoked the maximal response for each unit. We found that the preferred angle was invariant for most units when comparing the LDG and NCS stimuli (Fig.2g–i). Therefore, for any given preferred angle determined by real gratings, the unit tended to prefer the same angle when illusory gratings were evoked by NCS stimuli. Given that humans perceive the illusory grating as darker than the surrounding black background (Fig.1a, Supplementary Movie1), we presented NCS and LDG stimuli with a 180° relative luminance phase shift (Fig.2j) in order to demonstrate that mouse V1 units respond to the illusory grating as if the bars are darker than the surrounding black background. Such a result would strongly support that mouse V1 units respond to illusory brightness. In order to demonstrate this property in V1 units, we tested the hypothesis that unit responses preserved the spatial phase properties of the stimuli. As shown in rasters and peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) of example units, the response to NCS stimuli was shifted compared to the response to LDG stimuli (Fig.2a, b). We quantified this effect by calculating the phase shift between the first harmonic (F1 component) of the neuronal responses to NCS and LDG stimuli. In order to ensure the reliability of the calculated phase, this analysis was only applied to a subset of units (N= 209) in which their F1 component was the dominant frequency component (i.e., the power of the F1 component corresponding to the 2 Hz temporal frequency of the grating was larger than all other non-zero components). An example of an F1 dominant unit is shown in Fig.2k. We found that the phase shift between the NCS response and LDG response was significantly non-uniform (Rayleigh’s test,Z= 50,p= 7.3e-24) and tightly distributed around a circular mean of 178.23° (95% confidence interval = [167.66°, 188.90°]). This antiphase response to NCS and LDG stimuli corresponds to the antiphase luminance perceived by humans viewing these stimuli (Fig.2j). This correspondence indicates that mouse V1 units respond to illusory brightness in the form of grating bars that are darker than the surrounding black background. Overall, the results presented in Fig.2indicate that mouse V1 units respond to the illusory gratings evoked by NCS stimuli in a fundamentally similar manner to how they respond to real gratings. The DBC stimulus (Fig.1c) was designed to eliminate the filling-in effect and extinguish the illusory grating, and we showed that V1 units did not respond to the DBC stimulus (Fig.2a,b,f). However, the response to the NCS stimulus could be due to direct RF stimulation. We eliminated this possibility by performing a second experiment. After the RF mapping, we presented a full-screen version of the NCS, LDG, and DBC stimuli with larger distances between patches of concentric circles (Supplementary Fig.1). The greater distance between the inducers permitted the recording of additional units without RF-inducer overlap. We inserted the electrode with an oblique (30 degrees lateral) angle to cross multiple cortical columns with a variety of RF screen locations. In 13 mice, we recorded 1807 V1 single units, of which 234 units had an RF-inducer overlap of less than 1% of their RF size and no response to DBC stimulus. Units without RF-inducer overlap (“non-overlapping units”) still responded to the NCS stimulus (Fig.3a,b). This response was observed in 104 units, which is approximately half of the recorded units (Fig.3c). At the population level, the NCS stimulus-evoked response of these 104 units was present but again reduced compared to the LDG stimulus-evoked response (Fig.3d). There was only a weak correlation between the IGR and the degree of RF-inducer overlap (Pearson’s correlation coefficient:r= 0.09,p= 6.23e-3), Supplementary Fig.4, which means that the preference to respond to the NCS stimulus slightly increases as its RF encroaches upon the physical luminance change of the inducer. Therefore, units with an RF in the “dark” regions of the NCS stimulus still respond to the NCS stimulus. We conclude that the response to the NCS stimulus is not purely caused by physical luminance changes due to inducers in unit RFs. The non-overlapping units also maintained their shared preferred angle for real gratings (as determined by LDG stimuli) and illusory gratings (evoked by NCS stimuli) for most of these 104 units (Fig.3e). We also calculated the F1 phase shift between the NCS response and LDG response for the subset of units with a dominant f1 component (55 units) and found that the phase shift was significantly non-uniform (Rayleigh’s test, Z = 3.52,p= 0.028) with a circular mean of 214.55° (95% confidence interval = [167.4°, 261.6°], Fig.3f). The phase shift is robust as it holds for other units with varying amounts of RF-inducer overlap and becomes more closely aligned to a mean of 180° as the RF and inducer overlap to a greater extent (Supplementary Fig.5). However, even with no overlap, there is still considerable phase shift with a confidence interval containing the 180° antiphase relationship between the NCS and LDG stimuli. We conclude that the response to the NCS stimulus is due to the illusory grating induced by the concentric circles and not direct RF stimulation by small luminance changes driven by the overlap of the inducer with the RF of V1 single units. aRF of an example non-overlapping unit.

We next examined the level within the V1 local cellular organization where neural processing of the brightness illusion occurs. Studies on humans47, macaque35, and mice36have found that the neuronal response to visual illusions is delayed compared to real stimuli, which may suggest that the neural correlates of visual illusions could be at a different level within the V1 cellular hierarchy. For instance, a later response to a stimulus might be due to additional serial synaptic interactions within V1 (and also potentially from top-down inter-cortical poly-synaptic inputs from higher levels of the cortical hierarchy that may contribute to illusory perception)35,36,47,48. We calculated the latency of the NCS and LDG stimulus-evoked responses using only stimuli presented at the preferred direction of each unit49(see Methods section for a description of how latency was calculated). We excluded simple cells, which have a phase-locked response to the drifting grating and for which it is not possible to estimate response latency. We found that NSC stimulus-evoked responses are later than responses to LDG stimuli (Fig.4a). The latency (mean ± SEM) was 65.74 ± 0.17 ms for LDG but increased to 99.18 ± 0.33 ms for NCS stimuli (LMEM:F= 40.13,p= 4.62e-10). It should be noted that this held for units without RF-inducer overlap (mean ± SEM for NCS was 112.69 ± 7.45 compared to 62.39 ± 5.6 for LDG; LMEM:F= 29.02,p= 2.59e-7). These data suggest the potential that the neural correlates of illusory brightness in V1 require additional serial synaptic processing. aThe response latencies to NCS and LDG stimuli.

Source data are provided as aSource Datafile. However, an alternative explanation, which excludes additional serial synaptic processing, is that the response to the LDG stimulus occurs earlier because it has more physical luminance compared to the NCS stimulus. The slower latency of the NCS stimulus could be due to its lower physical luminance activating feedforward inputs more slowly, as opposed to it requiring a greater number of serial synaptic activations. We tested this explanation by comparing response latencies when the response magnitude was matched for the NCS and LDG stimuli. We identified 286 equi-responsive complex cells for this analysis. The response to NCS stimuli remained significantly delayed compared to LDG stimulus-evoked responses (LMEM:F= 30.74,p= 4.31e-8; Supplementary Fig.6). We also assessed whether the processing delay could be explained by the fact that the NCS stimulus drives Off RFs, which could potentially have a delayed response relative to the On RFs activated by the LDG stimulus. The black rectangles presented during the initial RF mapping experiment provide a convenient means of characterizing the response latency of Off RFs. The latency of the neuronal response to the black rectangles used in the RF mappings is a generic measure that can be calculated for simple and complex cells because there is no phasic component in the stimulus. We termed this measure the “rectangle latency.” We estimated the rectangle latency for the 381 units with an evoked response. The rectangle latency was 42.76 ± 0.75 ms (mean ± SEM). The PSTH of some example units and their rectangle latencies are depicted in Supplementary Fig.7. We compared the NCS latency to the rectangle latency in the subset of units for which we could calculate both latencies (236 units). The NCS responses were significantly delayed compared to responses to rectangles (95.03 ± 4.67 ms versus 40.29 ± 0.94 ms for NCS or rectangle, respectively; mean ± SEM; LMEM:F= 16.80,p= 4.92e-5). A similar latency difference was observed for units with limited RF-inducer overlap (mean ± SEM: 51.97 ± 2.1 ms rectangle latency compared to 112.69 ± 7.45 NCS response latency; LMEM:F= 9.64,p= 2.48e-3). Overall, these results demonstrate that the V1 neuronal response to illusory gratings is delayed relative to real gratings. Importantly, we eliminated at least two potential causes of the delayed response to illusory brightness in the NCS stimulus: the Off RF response to NCS stimuli and the difference in the magnitude of the evoked response between NCS and LDG stimuli. Therefore, the delay may be due to V1 neuronal processing of the illusory gratings requiring additional serial synaptic activations within the V1 microcircuit in comparison to real gratings. If NCS responsive neurons are indeed activated at a later stage of feed-forward processing in the V1 microcircuit, then these neurons should have a later response to real stimuli in general48. We hypothesized that neurons with a positive IGR (i.e., a preference for the NCS stimulus relative to the LDG stimulus) would have a longer rectangle latency in line with these neurons being activated at a later stage of bottom-up serial synaptic activation in V1. We tested this hypothesis by calculating the correlation between the rectangle latency and the IGR index. Our analysis revealed that IGR was actually anti-correlated with rectangle latency (Pearson’s correlation coefficient:r= −0.31,p= 5.17e-10, Fig.4b). This result suggests that the delayed response to the NCS stimulus may not be due to additional serial synaptic activations within V1, but could instead be due to serial synaptic activations that occur outside of V1 (e.g., from higher visual areas) that may be required for the V1 neuronal response to illusory brightness. Next, we probed the V1 microcircuit more deeply and defined what additional components of the microcircuit are engaged during illusory brightness processing compared to real gratings. We began by assessing the relationship of the role of surround modulation, as it has been suggested that this is a result of intra-V1 horizontal connections50,51,52,53(although, note that it also depends on inter-cortical feedback/feedforward connections24,26). We hypothesized that V1 units with more robust surround modulation are preferentially responsive to NCS stimuli. We tested this hypothesis by calculating the correlation between the IGR index and a surround modulation index (see Methods section, Eq.2). The surround modulation index was calculated using the size tuning curves of each unit. This index is negative when stimulus presentation outside the classical RF facilitates the firing rate (i.e., a so-called ‘facilitative cell’) and is positive when extra-classical RF stimulation suppresses the firing rate (i.e., ‘suppressive cell’). Supplementary Fig.8shows the size tuning of example facilitative and suppressive cells. We found that IGR and the surround modulation index were positively correlated (Pearson’s correlation coefficient:r= 0.26,p= 4.6e-8). The relationship between these variables is shown in Fig.4c. This result indicates that a greater response to NCS stimuli (relative to LDG stimuli) is associated with positive surround modulation indicative of suppressive cell activation. When we separated NCS preferring units (with higher responses to NSC stimuli) and LDG preferring units (with higher responses to LDG stimuli), we found that LDG preferring units had a mean ± SEM surround modulation index of 0.22 ± 0.01, indicating weak surround modulation (Fig.4d). On the other hand, for NCS preferring units, the mean ± SEM was 0.53 ± 0.03. The difference in surround modulation index between these unit sub-populations was significant (LMEM: Fstat. = 57.60,p= 1.73e-13). These results indicate that NCS preferring units have more robust surround modulation in comparison to LDG preferring units and that illusory brightness processing may involve V1 suppressive cells. These findings provide evidence supporting the notion that V1 units that respond to illusory brightness receive greater intra-V1 horizontal connections (although inter-cortical connections may also play a role). Another property of V1 cells related to the functional organization of the V1 microcircuit is their complex versus simple cell designation29,30,31,32. Unlike simple cells, there are no segregated excitatory/inhibitory areas in the RF of complex cells; therefore, their responses are not locked to the phase of the drifting grating. The response of two complex cells is shown in Supplementary Fig.9. Many studies have suggested that complex cells receive bottom-up inputs from simple cells22,23,31,54,55. We tested the hypothesis that NCS preferring units would be more likely characterized as complex cells. We separated putative simple and complex cells using a complex-simple modulation (CSM) index, which calculates the power of the F1 component of the grating-entrained response relative to the F0 component (see Methods section, Eq.3). The CSM index was calculated using responses to LDG stimuli. A CSM index of −1 is indicative of a complex cell, whereas an index of +1 indicates a simple cell. We observed no correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient,r= 0.05,p= 0.2) between CSM index and IGR (Supplementary Fig.10a). We next calculated the IGR index for NCS stimuli relative to LDG stimuli but used the amplitude of the F1 component rather than the average stimulus-evoked firing rate. We refer to this version of the IGR index as the IGRF1index (see Methods, Eq.4). Figure4eshows that the IGRF1index was negatively correlated with the CSM index (Pearson’s correlation coefficient,r= −0.34,p= 3.7e-9). The same analysis for non-overlapping units led to similar results (Supplementary Fig.10b, c). This result suggests that units, which are likely to be complex cells, have a larger response entrained to the temporal frequency of the grating for NCS stimuli (an illusory grating) relative to the LDG stimuli (a physically present grating). Thus, the NCS response may involve bottom-up inputs from simple cells in the V1 microcircuit. Many studies have investigated the functional role of interneurons in the visual system and have shown that interneurons contribute to various neuronal properties, such as orientation and direction selectivities56,57,58, and simple/complex RFs33,59. We therefore assessed whether V1 interneurons have differential responses to NCS stimuli. We used extracellular waveform characteristics to identify putative V1 interneurons and pyramidal neurons and compare their IGR and IGRF1indices. We determined a putative neuron type using the trough-to-peak latency (TPL) for the average spike waveform of each unit45,60,61. The distribution of TPL values was bimodal, thus suggesting two classes of neurons: those with a narrow waveform were considered to be putative inhibitory interneurons (I units,N= 146), and those with a wide waveform were putatively pyramidal neurons (E units,N= 374). Figure4fshows the TPL distribution and separation of putative classes of neurons. The average stimulus-evoked responses of each putative cell type are shown in Supplementary Fig.11. The LDG stimulus- evoked responses in a similar proportion of I units and E units (95% and 92%, respectively; Fig.4g). Importantly, however, NCS stimuli evoked responses in a significantly larger proportion of I units compared to E units (69% and 57%, respectively; chi-squared test: χ2= 6.28,p= 0.012). Moreover, the IGR was larger for I units relative to E units (Fig.4hleft; LMEM:F= 10.11,p= 1.56e-3). We also found that the IGRF1index of I units was higher than that of the E units (Fig.4hright; LMEM:F= 10.68,p= 1.15e-3). However, when we limited this analysis to non-overlapping units, we found that IGR and IGRF1were not significantly different between I units and E units (Fig.4i). In order to investigate this discrepancy, we estimated the distance between the RF and the center of the closest inducer and calculated its correlation with the NCS delay index (see methods, Eq.5). The NCS delay index characterizes the NCS response latency relative to the rectangle latency. There was no correlation for E units (Pearson’s correlation coefficient:r= −0.03,p= 0.52, Fig.4j), but a significant positive correlation was observed for I units (Pearson’s correlation coefficient:r= 0.21,p= 1.46e-3, Fig.4k). Therefore, as the distance between the unit’s RF and the inducer increased, the latency of response to the NCS stimulus increased. These results suggest that putative inhibitory interneurons in V1 could be involved in the spatial spreading and filling-in effect that underlies the appearance of illusory gratings in the NCS illusion. The V1 microcircuit is characterized by cortical layer-specific cell types and layer-specific intra-V1 synaptic connections (as well as differential extra-V1 afferent and efferent connections). Therefore, we assessed whether NCS responsive units were more prevalent in a specific layer of V1. We used current-source density (CSD) analysis to identify the approximate laminar location of each single unit45,62,63(Supplementary Fig.12a). We compared the IGR index across cortical layers and found that units in layer VI emitted weaker responses to illusory gratings in comparison to all other cortical layers (Supplementary Fig.12b). We did not observe significant differences in the NCS response latencies in different layers (Supplementary Fig.12c). Therefore, V1 units that respond to illusory brightness have a bias toward the superficial layers, which receive top-down cortico-cortical feedback, and the granular layer receiving thalamo-cortical input. Overall, our results suggest that brightness illusions activate specific components of the V1 microcircuit: surround suppression, complex cells (though this result was mixed, indicating a nuanced role that does not exclusively favor complex over simple cells), layers I through V, and putative interneurons. Interneurons may play a role in the spatial spread of illusory brightness. These components of the V1 microcircuit and the recurrent serial synapses between interneurons and pyramidal neurons, as well as feed-forward synapses from simple cells to complex cells, may contribute to the delayed response to illusory gratings compared to real ones. Top-down modulation of V1 is thought to play a role in the perception of illusions36,64. We hypothesized that feedback from higher levels of visual cortex modulates the NCS-evoked response of V1 units. We tested this hypothesis by optogenetically inhibiting HVAs while recording the V1 single unit responses to the NCS, LDG, and DBC stimuli. Inhibition was achieved by activating parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons in LM and LI, which are analogous to the ventral pathway in primates65. In 6 PV-cre mice, we recorded from V1, LM, and LI using a 64-channel silicon probe (30° implantation angle) combined with a tapered fiber for targeted inhibition of LM and LI (Fig.5a). Figure5bshows an example multi-unit spiking in response to the rectangle stimuli presented during a RF mapping session. As shown in Fig.5c, the multi-unit RF of each channel along the probe has a slightly different location than adjacent channels due to the oblique insertion of the electrode. As we move along the probe, the retinotopic RF location on the screen moves in one direction until it enters another visual area where the retinotopic RF location starts to change in the opposite direction (black arrows in Fig.5c). These reversal points, which indicate the borders of visual areas, were used as an index to specify the area associated with each channel. After mapping the extent of each visual cortex area on the probe, we set the upper bound of optogenetic illumination to limit the light leakage onto V1. We ensured that V1 activity was not directly inhibited by the light (see Methods). As a result of optogenetic manipulation, we observed that laser emission significantly affected the NCS response of 78.94% of units in LM and 85.48% of units in LI (either increased or decreased activity). Supplementary Fig.13presents the NCS and LDG responses of individual LM and LI units in the presence and absence of optogenetic stimulation. aOblique insertion of a single-shank electrode array combined with optical fiber, targeting mouse lateral visual areas for simultaneous electrophysiological recording and optogenetics manipulation.

The green lines indicate the times of stimulus onset and offset. Note that in some individual units, inhibition of HVAs enhanced the response to LDG stimuli, which is consistent with other studies showing that inhibiting lateral visual areas in mice increases the V1 neuronal response to large stimuli like those used here to study neurons without RF-inducer overlap85.fThe bar plot shows the average firing rate (baseline subtracted) across four conditions.

Franklin, Page 97, Copyright Elsevier 201986. Source data are provided as aSource Datafile. We constrained our analysis to 85 V1 units (out of 653) that did not have RF-inducer overlap. 56.5% of these units responded only to the LDG stimuli and 43.5% responded to both the LDG and NCS stimuli (Fig.5d). After inhibition of LM and LI, the V1 unit response to the NCS stimulus was reduced (LMEM:F= 4.16,p= 0.04). Example units are shown in Fig.5e. At the population level, inhibition of HVAs diminished the V1 unit response to illusory brightness without modulating the response to real gratings (Fig.5f). The responses of individual single units are shown in Supplementary Fig.14. These results indicate that top-down input from HVAs to V1 exerts a modulatory influence on V1 specifically in the context of processing stimuli that evoke illusory brightness. A most intriguing question in studying the neural correlates of visual illusions in animals is whether they are related to the “perception” of the illusion. In the absence of a system (i.e., language) for reporting subjective, first-hand perceptual experience, the perception of illusory brightness can be probed in pre-linguistic subjects (e.g., human babies) and subjects lacking language (e.g., animals) using pupillometry66. In humans, subjective perception of brightness or darkness evokes a pupillary response37,38,39,40. For instance, images we subjectively interpret as bright objects, such as a picture of the sun, will evoke pupil constriction relative to control images that are not interpreted as bright even though both images have the same physical luminance37. Brightness illusions that cause pupil constriction in humans also do so in rats41. Therefore, the pupillary response can be used as putative and indirect evidence of perceptual report in pre-linguistic human subjects and animals, alike. We hypothesized that the pupil would dilate after the NCS stimulus because it is perceived by humans to have “darker than black” gratings. On the other hand, we predicted the opposite pupil response (constriction) after the LDG stimulus, which is perceived as an increase in brightness by human subjects. As a control, we expected the DBC stimulus to not evoke a pupillary response because it was identical to the NCS stimulus, but contained occluders that block the perception of illusory darkness in humans. We measured pupil size in 6 mice. In support of our hypothesis, the pupil dilated in response to the NCS stimulus, constricted in response to the LDG stimulus, and remained stable for the DBC stimulus (Fig.6a). We calculated a pupil dilation index by subtracting the baseline pupil size (averaged over the 0.2 s window before stimulus onset) from the unnormalized pupil size (averaged over the 1 s window of stimulus presentation) and dividing it by the sum of the two. A positive value is a dilation, a negative value is a constriction, and a value of approximately zero is no change from baseline. The magnitude of the dilatory response to the NCS stimulus was as strong as the constriction to the LDG stimulus, as assessed using the pupil dilation index (Fig.6b). Note that the luminance for NCS and DBC reduces by 0.82% during stimulus presentation compared to pre-stimulus luminance. Critically, despite this similarity in luminance reduction, the pupil responses to these two stimuli were markedly different (Fig.6). This disparity in pupillary response, despite similar luminance reductions, suggests that the pupil reactions are not solely due to luminance changes. Conversely, luminance for the LDG stimulus increases by 23.35%. Although the luminance change in LDG, versus NCS, is 28 times higher, the max pupil response in these two conditions is similar (~8% constriction in response to LDG and ~6% dilation in response to NCS). These results demonstrate that luminance differences do not explain the pupil response magnitude. The opposing responses of the mouse pupil to the NCS and LDG stimuli provide a reflexive behavioral report that indirectly supports the perception of the illusory grating by mice, as it does in humans. aThe average pupil size over time normalized to baseline.

Illusions are a powerful tool for studying the neural correlates of subjective perception. Studies of the V1 single neuron response to illusory brightness are limited7,8, have produced inconsistent results with respect to fMRI studies9,10,11,12,13,14, and have not investigated properties of the cellular microcircuitry or their dependence on top-down modulation from higher visual cortex area. Major theoretical views depend on properties of microcircuits and feedback35,36,47,48and therefore, experimental data at the microcircuit level and manipulation of feedback from HVAs are critical for supporting theory at the single neuron level. In addition to the limited single neuron studies in animals, fMRI studies of human V1 BOLD signal responses to different features of illusory surfaces, specifically illusory fill-in in NCS9and the Cornsweet illusion10, have been unable to discriminate between the perceptual experience of brightness, color, or other aspects of stimulus12,14,64. Moreover, only limited extrapolation can be made about neuronal activity from the fMRI BOLD signal. Overall, it is controversial whether V1 contributes to the perception of illusory brightness7,16,17,18, and thus, the neural correlates of illusory brightness remain largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of NCS – previously only demonstrated in humans9,21– to produce a brightness illusion that forms an oriented grating. We used an achromatic version of NCS stimuli to probe the neural correlates of illusory brightness in mice. The specific use of gratings allowed us to compare multiple properties of the neuronal response between illusory and physical gratings, including drift direction (angle) tuning properties, entrainment to the temporal properties of the grating (i.e., the F1 component of the neuronal response), and phase shifting to illusory and physical gratings with opposing phase. Using this design, we show that mouse V1 single units respond to the illusory drifting grating evoked by NCS stimuli even if there is no direct RF stimulation. Critically, V1 single units did not respond to control stimuli in which pixel-wise changes in physical luminance are matched to the NCS condition but illusory brightness is blocked. These control stimuli do not evoke the perception of illusory brightness or illusory gratings by human observers (see Supplementary Movie2). We found that the neuronal tuning properties are similar for real gratings (LDG stimuli) and illusory gratings, which suggests that NCS stimuli evoke neuronal responses characteristic of those to actual gratings. Importantly, by presenting illusory gratings and physical gratings with a 180° spatial phase shift, we show that V1 neurons respond to the spatial phase properties of the illusory gratings and, therefore, track the illusory brightness perceived by human subjects. Collectively, these results are strong evidence for the response of V1 single units to illusory brightness. Given the lack of direct demonstration of a V1 single unit response to illusory brightness, it is unsurprising that there has been no study characterizing the V1 microcircuits involved in processing of brightness illusions. Our paradigm, translated from humans to mice, demonstrates a V1 single unit response to brightness illusions and allowed us to uncover a few aspects of the V1 microcircuit that are responsive to illusory brightness. These include surround suppression, complex cells, and putative fast-spiking interneurons. We found that V1 neurons with greater surround suppression effects have a greater response to NCS stimuli. At a mechanistic level, this finding is consistent with multiple potential interpretations. For instance, it may support the notion that top-down feedback onto V1 plays a role in illusory brightness perception because optogenetic studies have shown that surround suppression in V1 depends on feedback connections25,67. Therefore, the activation of surround suppression by the NCS stimuli could indicate the engagement of feedback. However, optogenetic studies have also shown that surround suppression depends on intra-V1 horizontal connections52and therefore, our result may also be interpreted as a sign of activation of specific aspects of the intra-V1 microcircuit. On the other hand, several studies have demonstrated surround suppression in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), suggesting surround suppression could be partially inherited from LGN through feed-forward connections68,69,70,71. Although the intra-V1 and extra-V1 neuronal connections involved in illusory brightness processing remain unclear, our work demonstrates that surround suppressed cells are involved in processing of NCS stimuli. We also evaluated the propensity for complex cells to respond to illusory gratings as a means of characterizing the involvement of various aspects of the V1 microcircuit in processing of the NCS stimulus. Complex cells receive input from simple cells, which may be thought of as a “lower” hierarchical level in the V1 microcircuit23,29,30,31,32,54. Intriguingly, we found no correlation between IGR and the CSM index, showing that complex and simple cells seem to have a similar propensity for illusory and real gratings. On the other hand, we observed that complex cells had a higher F1 response to the illusory grating. This discrepancy (IGR versus IGR calculated on the F1 component) may be related to the fact that the F1 component encodes the perceptual content of the drifting grating. However, it is clear that the role of complex and simple cells in illusion processing currently needs to be clarified and requires further study. It has been shown that interneurons play a crucial role in visual perception56,57,58,72,73,74,75. We assessed the responses of putative interneurons and pyramidal neurons and found that putative interneurons were more responsive to NCS stimuli than LDG stimuli. Therefore, V1 interneurons may contribute to the processing of illusory brightness. Interestingly, we found that their latency to respond to the NCS stimulus increases with distance between the RF and the inducer, which could indicate a role in the filling-in effect. The NCS stimulus depends on an illusory filling-in of space between the inducers. As the distance from the inducer increases, the neuron’s RF overlaps more with the area “filled in” by the illusory brightness change. The increased response latency at filled-in locations may be due to progressive integration or interpolation across the visual field. We found that it is primarily interneurons that respond in this manner and may, therefore, be involved in filling in (at least in this particular illusion). However, it is currently unclear how interneurons and synaptic inhibition might generate filling-in. It is possible that network-level effects, such as interactions with excitatory neurons or disinhibition (via interneurons inhibiting other interneurons), play a role in filling in when the brain confronts ambiguous or incomplete visual cues. The predominant, yet unproven, theoretical view for the neuronal mechanism of subjective perception is that it is critically dependent upon late-stage synaptic feedback to V1 neurons that occurs after an initial feed-forward pass through V136,64,76. One prediction of this theory is that the V1 neuronal response latency should be delayed for illusory stimuli relative to real stimuli because of the time required for activation of additional synapses extrinsic to V1. Indeed, in line with the prior work on response latencies in humans47, macaques35, and mice36, we found that the neuronal response to the illusory grating was delayed relative to a real grating. Our findings support the theoretical notion that the V1 neuronal response to illusory gratings cannot be only feed-forward and driven by physical changes in the RF. Here, we performed a critical test of this theory by optogenetically inhibiting the HVAs during the presentation of an illusory brightness stimulus and showed that this diminished the V1 single unit response to the illusory grating. Our findings provide a causal test of the role of feedback from HVAs onto the V1 processing of brightness illusions. While our results suggest a key role for top-down modulation from HVAs, it is also important to note three caveats. First, we could not record from or precisely manipulate neurons in HVAs with RFs overlapping with NCS-responsive V1 neurons due to using a single multi-electrode shank covering multiple cortical areas. Therefore, we cannot conclude that HVAs provide targeted top-down modulation to retinotopically-matched V1 neurons, only that HVAs provide a general modulation of the V1 response to illusory stimuli. Second, this evidence supporting top-down modulation does not exclude a role for bottom-up inputs, such as responses to illusory gratings already at the thalamic inputs to V1. Critically, the mouse visual paradigm presented here can be used for thalamic recordings to test the role of bottom-up inputs. Lastly, while the optogenetic modulation provides strong evidence for top-down modulation, it is essential to note that indirect electrophysiological measures of top-down modulation (i.e., the layer-specific response) and serial synaptic activation (i.e., the rectangle latency) do not clearly indicate that the NCS response is due to top-down modulation or occurring at a later stage of serial synaptic activation. Collectively, the results suggest a complex interplay between bottom-up and top-down processing in visual perception beyond the traditional conception of visual cortex processing as a strictly hierarchical system. Our results demonstrate, at a different level of detail compared to fMRI BOLD, the single cell and V1 cellular microcircuit-level neuronal correlates of visual processing of illusory brightness. Moreover, we show its dependence on feedback from HVAs. These findings were made possible by translating an illusory brightness stimulus from studies in humans into a compatible format for electrophysiology in mice. However, one limitation of this experimental paradigm is that it is challenging to make strong claims about how single unit activity relates to perception. Therefore, we measured the reflexive pupil response to the illusory and real gratings as an indirect measure of perceived luminance, as has been done previously in human subjects37and in rats41. Our findings that the mouse pupil responds in opposing directions for these two stimuli, which humans perceive as getting darker or brighter than the background, are potentially consistent with mice and humans similarly perceiving these stimuli. While future work is needed to support this limited claim (e.g., with an overt behavioral report in a brightness discrimination task), our findings do unravel, at the single-cell level, the V1 processing (or “sensing”) of illusory brightness which may be seen as distinct from attaching an interpretation or meaning to stimuli as being brighter (“perception”)77. By building on our indirect measure of perceived luminance, future work can use overt behavioral reports to establish a link between V1 single cell activity and subjective perception of brightness illusions. Experiments were performed on awake head-fixed adult mice on a disc. The local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Tübingen) approved all animal procedures and the procedures were done in compliance with EU Directive 2010/63/EU (European Community Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals). Data acquisition was done through several electrode penetrations in both hemispheres of 19 C57BL/6 or PV-Cre mice (homozygous for the PV-Cre genes, B6;129P2-Pvalbtm1(cre)Arbr/J). The sex specification of the mice and the number of performed experiments on each mouse are presented in Supplementary Tables1−3. Mice were housed with sibling cagemates on a 12-h light/dark reverse cycle. Humidity was between 40% and 60%, and the temperature was 22 ± 1 °C. After head-post surgery, mice were singly housed. Mice were induced by 2.5% of isoflurane during surgery and maintained at 1−2%. Also, Atropine (Atropinsulfat B. Braun, 0.3 mg/kg) and Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) were administered via subcutaneous injections to reduce bronchial secretions and as analgesics, respectively. The scalp was sterilized and opened to expose the lambda and bregma sutures. A lightweight head-post was installed onto the skull using an adhesive primer and dental cement (OptiBond FL primer and adhesive, Kerr dental; Tetric EvoFlow dental cement, Ivoclar Vivadent). A small well was built around the exposed area using dental cement. Two silver wires were implanted between the dura and skull over the frontal lobe as ground references for extracellular recordings. Then, the skull was covered with Kwik-Cast (WPI). The post-surgery analgesic (Flunixin, 4 mg/kg) continued to be administered every 12 h for three days, and antibiotics (Baytril, 5 mg/kg) were administered for five days. After recovery, animals were habituated to head-fixation and placed on a disc for three days (0.5 h/day). On the fourth day, a small craniotomy (1 mm2) was drilled above the V1 at 2.5 mm laterally and 1.1 mm anterior of the transverse sinus78under general anesthesia. Electrophysiological recordings were started one day after craniotomy surgery and continued on consecutive days for as long as the neuron isolation remained of high quality. The craniotomy was covered with Kwik-Cast after each recording. Mice were head-fixed on a disc and allowed to sit or run on it in a dark and electromagnetic isolated room. In a group of six mice, a 32-channel linear silicon probe (Neuronexus, A1x32-5mm-25-177-A32) was penetrated the V1 perpendicularly to a depth of ~900 μm below the brain surface (the depth of electrode insertions is presented in Supplementary Table1). In 13 mice, a 64-channel silicon probe (CambridgeNeuroTech, H9 or H3) was inserted with an oblique angle (~30°) penetration distance ~1400 μm below the brain surface. Electrical signals were amplified and digitized at 30 kHz by the Cerebus data acquisition system (v7.0.4; Blackrock Microsystems LLC) or RHD recording system (Intan Technologies) and Open Ephys GUI (v0.4.4 or v0.4.6). NPMK (VS.0.0.0; BlackrockNeurotech) was used to read recorded data. A photodiode was attached to the lower right corner of the screen to capture the exact stimulus onset from a white square synchronized to the stimulus presented. A rotary encoder (US Digital, MA3-A10-125-B) connected to the disk converted the disk angle to a voltage between 0 V and +5 V, and the analog signal corresponding to the axis rotation was recorded as input into the acquisition system at 30 kHz. Stimuli were projected onto a gamma-corrected LED monitor (Dell U2412M, 24 inches, 60 Hz) placed 15 cm in front of the animal’s eye. Visual stimuli were programmed and generated in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc.) and Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3). To obtain the RF map of recorded neurons, black rectangles (~15° widths) were presented on a gray background with a duration of 100 ms and an interval of 100 ms in different locations of 8 by 13 grids. The duration of the RF mapping session was 20 min. After this section, the response to each rectangle was extracted by an analysis of multi-unit activity (MUA). Then, the center of the MUA RF was estimated by the best fit of a two-dimensional Gaussian to the MUA activities. Subsequent target stimuli were presented on a gray background at the estimated RF center. To obtain the size-tuning curve, circular patches of drifting grating (spatial frequency 0.05 cycles/degree, temporal frequency 3 Hz) with different sizes (2.5, 5, 10, 15, …, 45°) and two drifting directions (rightward and upward) were presented. The duration of the stimulus presentation was 666.7 ms with a 500 ms interval, and the duration of the whole session was 25 min. We presented three types of drifting grating stimuli for the neon color session. (1) Neon color spreading (NCS) consists of nine patches of white concentric circles (0.1° thickness) as inducers (each patch had three circles), arranged on a three-by-three virtual grid on a black square (35° widths). The diameter of the inducers was 3, 6, and 9°, respectively. At each frame, the intersection of concentric circles and a drifting grating (spatial frequency = 0.05 cycle/degree and temporal frequency = 2 Hz) was replaced with gray segments, resulting in the “darker than black” illusory grating (Fig.1a, Supplementary Movie1). (2) Diffusion-blocked stimulus is a control condition with exactly the same pixel-wise changes as NCS, while each inducer circle is sandwiched by two white circles (0.4° thickness). The added circles constrain the gray filling-in and reduce the illusory effect (Fig.1c, Supplementary Movie2). (3) Luminance-defined grating (LDG) is defined as gray grating moving on top of inducers (Fig.1d, Supplementary Movie3). These three types of drifting grating were generated in eight directions, making 24 conditions. These stimuli were presented with a duration of 1 s for 70 trials in a pseudo-randomized order. We also generated a fullscreen version of the same sets of stimuli and used them in our experiments with the following specifications. The thickness of white concentric circles (i.e., inducers) was 0.4°, and their diameter was 8, 16, and 24° in a batch of 3. The arrangement of concentric inducers was on a honeycomb structure, providing a maximal illusory area with a diameter of 39° between each patch of inducers. The thickness of blocking circles for fullscreen DBC was 0.8°. For viral injection, we drilled a small craniotomy window (<1 mm) above the LM region (from bregma, AP: −4 mm, LM: 4.1 mm). We used a glass micropipette containing undiluted Cre-inducible DIO-AAV4 (AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-pA) to perform the injections at a rate of 6 nl/s using Nanoject III (Drummond Scientific). The injections were carried out at four depths, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mm below the cortical surface, with 40 nl of the virus injected at each depth. We started the injections at the deepest spot, and after each injection, the glass pipette was left in place for 5 min before being pulled up. After the injection into both hemispheres, we covered the skull with Kwik-Cast (WPI). The animals were observed to regain consciousness within approximately 30 min following the surgical procedure. After the surgery, they were kept under monitoring for three days. We started the optogenetics experiments four weeks after viral injections. In order to suppress LM and LI, we expressed the Channelrhodopsin-2 (CHR2) gene in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons. We stimulated the specific region using blue light (473 nm laser from Laserglow Technologies). To deliver spatially selective light, the laser was connected to an optomechanical tool equipped with tapered fibers (ThetaStation OptogeniX). This tool allowed for precise control of light emission through the manual operation of a micrometric screw, which determined the specific sub-region of a Lambda fiber that emitted the light. For simultaneous optogenetics manipulation and electrophysiology, we used a silicon probe combined with tapered optical fiber (H3 probe, Cambridge NeuroTech; lambda-b fiber 200 core, 0.66 NA, emitting length 1.5 mm, Optogenix). We calibrated the power level for each depth at 100 µW by adjusting the power at the end of the patch cord (before implantation). The optogenetics session included electrophysiology recording and the presentation of NCS and LDG with and without optogenetic manipulation. The depth of light emission was adjusted after the receptive mapping session and identifying the borders of visual areas by finding reversal points of multi-unit RF centers on the screen65(Fig.6c). This adjustment aimed to avoid direct suppression of spontaneous activities in the primary visual cortex (V1). During the light stimulation, a constant one-second pulse was delivered synchronously with the presentation of the visual stimulus. The optical setup was controlled by Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (PTB-3) and custom code in Matlab, which communicated with a modified sound card using a TTL signal. For spike detection and clustering, we first concatenated the recorded data in all three experiment sessions (i.e., RF mapping, size tuning, and neon color). We then used the Kilosort algorithm, a template matching algorithm written in MATLAB for spike sorting, with the default parameters79. A manual clustering followed this for further merging, splitting, and choosing isolated clusters using template-gui (phy v2)80. All further analyses were done in MATLAB (v R2018a-R2020a) using built-in functions. The peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) was initially calculated with a resolution of 1 ms and smoothed by a moving average window of 2 ms. We estimated single-unit RFs by fitting a two-dimensional Gaussian function to their spiking activities in the RF mapping session. To extract visually evoked neurons and estimate their onset latency, we assumed that the spontaneous spiking activity prior to stimulus presentation follows a Poisson distribution49. By fitting a Poisson distribution to 300 ms prior to stimulus onset, the spontaneous firing rate λ was estimated. If the spiking activity after stimulus onset deviates from the background Poisson distribution to a particular level in three consecutive bins (a probability ofp< 0.01 for the first two bins andp< 0.05 for the third bin), the neuron was considered as an evoked neuron, and the corresponding time for the first bin is considered as a response latency of the neuron49. The preferred angle of cells is defined as the stimulus direction with the maximum response. To calculate changes in the preferred angle of neurons in NCS and LDG, first, we captured the direction tuning curve of the neuron by taking the average response of cells during the stimulus presentation (one second). Then, we interpolated the tuning curve with the spline method to get a more precise estimation of the preferred angle. We have quantified the illusory grating response for each neuron as follows. Where R is the average response of the neuron to the stimulus over the presentation period. A positive IGR represents a higher response to NCS and vice versa. We defined the surround modulation index as The surround modulation index is negative for facilitative cells and positive for suppressive cells. We implemented the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the PSTH to extract a temporal component of neuronal responses. The F1 component of the response is the power for 2 Hz, which is the same as the temporal frequency of the stimulus, and the F0 component is the average response. The complex-simple modulation index was calculated using the following equation for every single unit: Where F1 is the power of 2 Hz frequency, and F0 is the average firing rate in response to LDG stimuli. Neurons with a positive CSM index have a phase-locked response to the temporal frequency of drifting grating and are classified as simple cells. The phase-locked response is due to the separated excitatory and inhibitory subregions in their RF. A negative CSM index indicates the degree of spatial invariance in the RF and a lack of phase-locked responses. We calculated the relative amplitude of the F1 component (IGRF1) as in the following, where F1(NCS) and F1(LDG) are the amplitude of the F1 component of the response to NCS and LDG respectively. We assessed the delay of NCS responses compared to the response to black rectangles for every single unit using the following equation. Where the Latency(NCS) is the response latency to NCS stimuli and Latency (rectangle) is the latency of response to the contrast change of black rectangles within the RF, presented during the RF mapping session. To classify cells into two groups of putative inhibitory and excitatory cells, we fitted two Gaussian functions to the histogram of TPL, which shows a bimodal distribution. The intersection point of two Gaussian curves was selected as a threshold to classify putative I/E cells (Supplementary Fig.15). To extract the local field potential (LFP) signal, the extracellular signal was filtered within the 0.1 to 150 Hz frequency range using a Butterworth bandpass filter (Matlab “butter” and “filtfilt” functions) and downsampled at 1 kHz. To compute the CSD, we took the discrete second derivative of the LFP signal across the electrode sites. The resulting CSD map was then interpolated to obtain a smooth and continuous signal representation. To calculate disk speed, we downsampled the rotary encoder signal to 300 Hz and then converted the voltage data to disk angles. Voltage from 0 V to 5 V was mapped to 0-to-360°. The linear speed of the mouse was estimated by calculating the discrete differential of the disk angle over time and multiplying it by the disk diameter. We classified trials into two groups “run” and “still” trials. A trial was considered as run if the average mouse speed was higher than 1 (cm/s) in the first 500 ms of the trial (from 300 ms before stimulus onset). To calculate the overlap ratio, we first extracted the single unit responses to the presented rectangles during the RF mapping session. This resulted in a two-dimensional heatmap of the firing rate for each single unit. We scaled up the resolution of the heatmap using the Nearest-neighbor interpolation method. We masked all the pixels with an activity lower than three standard deviations to infer the RF of units. Supplementary Fig.16illustrate the masked activity of 10 non-overlapping RFs. Then, we fitted a 2-dimensional Gaussian function on the masked firing rate of the units. Finally, we focused on quantifying the overlap between the RFs and the inducers. We fitted an ellipse at the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the 2-dimensional Gaussian curve to achieve this. We then calculated the overlapping area between this ellipse and the largest surrounding inducers. This precise calculation allowed us to quantify the degree of overlap and assess the extent to which the inducers influenced each unit’s RF. We used the Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model as the primary statistical analysis unless otherwise specified. We incorporated two levels of hierarchy in the LME model to account for the nested structure of our data: the mouseID, representing individual mice, and the recording days, representing different days of data collection. For comparison of more than two groups of data, we used the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test which was followed by a post-hoc multiple comparison with Tukey’s honestly significant difference correction. For directional statistics, Rayleigh’s test has been implemented. To calculate Pearson’s correlation and its significant level (pvalue), we used the Matlab “corr” function, which etimates thepvalues using a two-sidedttest. We used the CircStat Toolbox81for statistical analysis of circular data. Videos were captured from the mouse eye at a rate of 45 frames per second using a near-infrared camera (Allied Vision, G-046B) with a variable zoom lens, fixed 3.3x zoom lens, and 0.25x zoom lens attachment (Polytec, 1-60135, 1-415 62831, 6044). The video was acquired via a GigE connection using the MATLAB image processing toolbox. With each video frame, the camera provided a TTL pulse recorded directly into the neurophysiology recording system to align pupillometry data with stimulus presentation in further analysis. We used near-infrared light (Thor Labs LED, M850L3 and Thor Labs Collimation optics, COP4-B) placed near the mouse eye (~30 cm) for illumination, and whole experiments were done in a dark chamber with no external light. We employed DeepLabCut, a computer vision software, to analyze the pupillometry videos and extract pupillometry data. The training dataset was created by manually labeling and outlining the pupil on 150 randomly selected frames from recorded videos of various mice. Data augmentation techniques, specifically the “imgaug” option, were utilized to enhance the training dataset. We utilized the “efficient net-b0” network and trained it for 500,000 iterations to analyze the recorded videos and extract pupil size measurements. To enhance the quality of the output results, we further applied the outlier extraction technique (also implemented in DeepLabcut) to refine the pupillometry data82. We then chunked and aligned the extracted pupil size with the stimulus onsets using the TTL signal of the camera. The pupil diameter was subtracted and divided by the average pupil size over 300 ms prior to the stimulus onset. Data was visualized using Matlab, and Adobe Illustrator 2020 was used to arrange panel figures.

The study is also the first to combine the use of two investigative techniques called electrophysiology and optogenetics to study this illusion. Results from experiments on mice settle a long-standing debate in neuroscience about which levels of neurons within the brain are responsible for the perception of brightness.We’re all familiar with optical illusions; some are novelties, while some are all around us. Even as you look at the screen in front you, you are being fooled into thinking that you’re seeing the color white. What you’re really seeing is lots of red, green and blue elements packed so tightly together it gives the impression of being white. Another example is a fast rotating wheel or propeller, which can briefly look like it’s reversing direction while it’s accelerating to full speed. In any case, it might be surprising to know that optical illusions are not just fun to look at but can also be a useful tool to learn more about eyes, nerves, minds and brains.Associate Professor Masataka Watanabe from the Department of Systems Innovation at the University of Tokyo is on a mission to understand more about the nature of consciousness. It’s a vast subject area so naturally there are many ways to explore it, and amongst other things, he uses optical illusions. His most recent research looked at whether a certain kind of illusion that works on humans would also work on mice. And it turns out, it does. But why is this significant?“Knowing this kind of illusion, called a neon-color-spreading illusion, works on mice as well as humans, is useful for neuroscientists like myself, as it means that mice can serve as useful test subjects for cases where humans cannot,” said Watanabe. “To really understand what goes on inside the brain during perceptual experiences, we need to use certain methods that we cannot use on people. These include electrophysiology, the recording of neural activity with electrodes, and optogenetics, where light pulses enable or disable firing of specific neurons in a living brain.”Watanabe’s experiment was the first of its kind to make use of both electrophysiology and optogenetics at the same time in animal test subjects exposed to the neon-color-spreading illusion, which allowed his team to see precisely what structures within the brain are responsible for processing the illusion.“After a visual stimulus lands on the eye, it’s carried to the brain by nerves and is then received by a series of layers of neurons called V1, V2 and so on, where V1 is the first and most basic layer, and V2 and above are considered higher layers,” said Watanabe. “There is a long-standing debate in neuroscience about the role higher levels play in the perception of brightness and it was not an easy thing to study. Our experiment on mice has shown us that neurons in V1 responded not just to the illusion, but also to a nonillusory version of the same kind of pattern shown. But only when the illusory version was shown to the mice did neurons in V2 also play a crucial role: that of modulating the activity of neurons in V1, thus proving that V2 neurons do in fact play a role in the perception of brightness.”This experiment has shown that mice models can be effective in this area of neuroscience. Watanabe hopes this is just the beginning and that such experiments will help toward his grand aim of clarifying the neural mechanism of consciousness.
We’re all familiar with optical illusions; some are novelties, while some are all around us. Even as you look at the screen in front you, you are being fooled into thinking that you’re seeing the color white. What you’re really seeing is lots of red, green and blue elements packed so tightly together it gives the impression of being white. Another example is a fast rotating wheel or propeller, which can briefly look like it’s reversing direction while it’s accelerating to full speed. In any case, it might be surprising to know that optical illusions are not just fun to look at but can also be a useful tool to learn more about eyes, nerves, minds and brains.Associate Professor Masataka Watanabe from the Department of Systems Innovation at the University of Tokyo is on a mission to understand more about the nature of consciousness. It’s a vast subject area so naturally there are many ways to explore it, and amongst other things, he uses optical illusions. His most recent research looked at whether a certain kind of illusion that works on humans would also work on mice. And it turns out, it does. But why is this significant?“Knowing this kind of illusion, called a neon-color-spreading illusion, works on mice as well as humans, is useful for neuroscientists like myself, as it means that mice can serve as useful test subjects for cases where humans cannot,” said Watanabe. “To really understand what goes on inside the brain during perceptual experiences, we need to use certain methods that we cannot use on people. These include electrophysiology, the recording of neural activity with electrodes, and optogenetics, where light pulses enable or disable firing of specific neurons in a living brain.”Watanabe’s experiment was the first of its kind to make use of both electrophysiology and optogenetics at the same time in animal test subjects exposed to the neon-color-spreading illusion, which allowed his team to see precisely what structures within the brain are responsible for processing the illusion.“After a visual stimulus lands on the eye, it’s carried to the brain by nerves and is then received by a series of layers of neurons called V1, V2 and so on, where V1 is the first and most basic layer, and V2 and above are considered higher layers,” said Watanabe. “There is a long-standing debate in neuroscience about the role higher levels play in the perception of brightness and it was not an easy thing to study.

However, its utility is constrained by a micrometre-scale spatial resolution imposed by the long-wavelength MIR diffraction limit. This limitation has been recently overcome by MIR photothermal imaging, which detects photothermal effects induced in the vicinity of MIR absorbers using a visible-light microscope. Despite its promise, the full potential of its spatial resolving power has not been realized. Here we present an optimal implementation of wide-field MIR photothermal imaging to achieve high spatial resolution. This was accomplished by employing single-objective synthetic-aperture quantitative phase imaging with synchronized subnanosecond MIR and visible light sources, effectively suppressing the resolution-degradation effect caused by photothermal heat diffusion. We demonstrated far-field MIR spectroscopic imaging with a spatial resolution limited by the visible diffraction, down to 120 or 175 nm in terms of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem or full-width at half-maximum of the point spread function, respectively, in the MIR region of 3.12–3.85 μm (2,600–3,200 cm−1). This technique—through the use of a shorter visible wavelength and/or a higher objective numerical aperture—holds the potential to achieve a spatial resolution of less than 100 nm, thus paving the way for MIR wide-field nanoscopy. You have full access to this article via your institution.  Vibrational spectroscopy—including mid-infrared (MIR) and Raman spectroscopy—is one of the gold standards for label-free and non-destructive chemical analysis. Although MIR spectroscopy has the advantage of higher sensitivity than Raman spectroscopy, one of its critical drawbacks is the low spatial resolution of a few micrometres imposed by the diffraction limit of the long MIR wavelength. To overcome this fundamental barrier, several traditional methods use near-field nanoscale probes or electron beams to perform super-resolution MIR imaging with spatial resolutions below 100 nm (ref.1). Although they find various applications in characterizing nanoscale materials such as polymer films and plasmonic structures, the need for a near-field operation or electron-beam radiation limits their applicability to certain types of samples, such as living biological specimens. Various far-field subdiffraction-limited MIR imaging methods have been recently developed to address this limitation, including vibrationally resonant nonlinear imaging2,3, ultraviolet-localized MIR photoacoustic imaging4and MIR photothermal (MIP) imaging5. These methods have enabled MIR imaging of submicrometre structures of living cells and pathology slides, as well as the detection of single viruses and bacteria. Despite their advances, there has been difficulty in achieving a spatial resolution of less than 100 nm—a challenging milestone for far-field optical imaging that distinguishes nanoscopy from microscopy6. One of the limiting factors is the lack of a high numerical-aperture (NA > 1) objective lens in the ultraviolet or MIR region. For example, in vibrationally resonant nonlinear imaging2,3, MIR and either near-infrared or visible beams are used to excite the sample’s nonlinear scattering; however, to achieve a high spatial resolution, the technique requires collinear focusing of MIR and near-infrared/visible beams onto the sample. This requirement calls for a MIR-compatible objective lens for which a high NA is not available (that is, the NAs are typically below ~0.65), consequently limiting the spatial resolution to ~450 nm in the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM)3. In ultraviolet-localized MIR photoacoustic imaging4, the change in the Grüneisen parameter following a MIR-absorption-induced temperature rise is imaged by ultraviolet photoacoustic imaging. In this technique, the use of ultraviolet light is essential to ensure its applicability to various types of samples, as the ultraviolet light is absorbed by various molecular structures to generate a photoacoustic signal; however, the lack of a high-NA objective lens in the ultraviolet region (for example, NA ≈ 0.45) prohibits this technique from fully exploiting the advantage of the short ultraviolet wavelength, thus limiting its spatial resolution to ~260 nm in FWHM. In contrast, MIP imaging5offers the potential to achieve higher spatial resolution in the far-field because its detection is based on the visible light, for which high-NA objective lenses are readily available; however, conventional implementations are suboptimal and often hindered by the heat diffusion of the photothermal effect, leading to a degradation of spatial resolution. For instance, earlier demonstrations of MIP imaging employed continuous-wave visible light to detect the photothermal signal induced by pulsed or continuous-wave MIR light, both in point-scanning and wide-field configurations7,8,9,10,11,12. Although these techniques can realize almost visible-diffraction-limited spatial resolution when the sample is open to air, which has a small thermo-optic coefficient (−10−6K−1)13, a realization of high spatial resolution approaching 100 nm or below requires the use of immersion objective lenses with NAs larger than 1. In such cases, the spatial resolution is limited by the characteristic length of heat diffusion into the surrounding medium with a large thermo-optic coefficient (for example, −10−4K−1for water)13, typically several hundred nanometers14. A spatial resolution below 200 nm was recently demonstrated with aqueous samples by higher-order harmonic lock-in detection, which mitigates the heat diffusion problem in the point-scanning configuration15. However, taking higher-order harmonics considerably decreases the signal intensity by an order of magnitude, resulting in a relatively long pixel dwell time of ~200 ms. Furthermore, the point-scanning method suffers from limitations in imaging speed due to the slow mechanical scan of the sample stage. These issues can be addressed by employing a pump–probe wide-field configuration that uses nanosecond pulses and an image sensor. In this method, a MIR pulse excites the molecular vibrations in a wide-field manner, and the induced photothermal heat is subsequently probed by a visible pulse and captured with an image sensor, ideally before noticeable heat diffusion occurs16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Although video-rate imaging has been demonstrated with this method22, past demonstrations have not realized its full spatial resolving power due to the use of air objective lenses with moderate NAs and pump–probe pulses with durations of more than 10 ns, which degraded the spatial resolution by more than several tens of nanometers in an aqueous environment23. In this work we present a wide-field MIP imaging technique optimized for high spatial resolution, paving the way for far-field MIR nanoscopy. We developed passively synchronized subnanosecond MIR and visible light sources to prevent degradation of spatial resolution due to the photothermal heat diffusion. Furthermore, to enable the use of a high-NA immersion objective lens for visible imaging while simultaneously illuminating the sample with the MIR light, we developed a single-objective synthetic-aperture quantitative phase imaging (SOSA-QPI) technique. By combining these, our time-resolved SOSA-QPI system enables visible-diffraction-limited MIP imaging and accomplishes far-field MIR spectroscopic imaging with an exceptional resolution of 120 nm or 175 nm in terms of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem or FWHM of the point-spread function (PSF), respectively, within the MIR region of 3.12–3.85 μm (2,600–3,200 cm−1), surpassing the MIR diffraction limit by a factor of 30. Moreover, our nanosecond pump–probe scheme ensures optimal use of the probe photons that only sense the non-diffused photothermal signals. Therefore, together with the wide-field detection capability, our SOSA-QPI enables an order of magnitude faster imaging speed of less than 1 min per frame compared with that of the state-of-the-art super-resolution far-field MIR imaging technique15. To achieve optimum spatial resolution and efficient use of the probe photons in MIP imaging, it is crucial to detect the photothermal effect with the visible light before the heat from the MIR absorbers diffuses beyond the visible diffraction limit. Based on our theoretical considerations, we estimated that MIR and visible pulse durations of ~1 ns meet this requirement when the visible spatial resolution is approximately 100 nm (seeMethodsand Supplementary Note1for details). We therefore developed passively synchronized subnanosecond MIR and visible light sources with pulse durations of ~0.5 ns (Fig.1a) through nonlinear wavelength conversions from a singleQ-switched Nd:YAG laser emitting 1,064 nm, 0.65 ns pulses at 1 kHz (Fig.1b). Details on the laser system are described inMethods. a, Temporal representation of the pump and probe pulses.b, Schematic representation of the system.c, Detailed depiction of the area around the sample on a visible (Vis)-reflective/MIR-transparent sample holder.d, Regions of the sample’s spatial-frequency spectrum probed with the objective lens with angled illuminations. OPO, optical parametric oscillator; LBO, lithium triborate; PBS, polarizing beamsplitter; QWP, quarter-wave plate; PPLN, periodically poled lithium niobate. To achieve high spatial resolution in MIP-QPI with the developed light sources, we designed a synthetic-aperture quantitative phase microscope (Methods) that allows the use of a high-NA immersion objective lens while ensuring MIR pulses reach the sample. We employed a single-objective QPI geometry with a visible-reflective and MIR-transparent sample holder. Figure1b,cpresents a schematic illustration of our SOSA-MIP-QPI system. The 532 nm pulses delivered with a single-mode optical fibre are collimated and split into two paths of the Mach–Zehnder interferometer. In the sample arm, a wedge prism is used to deflect the beam, delivering an angled beam to the sample with an illuminating NA of 1.0 via a water-immersion objective lens with an NA of 1.2 (UPlanSApo60x, Olympus). We incrementally rotate the wedge prism in 45° steps (Fig.1d), employing eight different azimuthal angles of illumination for aperture synthesis unless otherwise noted (Methods). The designed synthetic NA of 2.2 corresponds to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling spatial resolution of 121 nm. We used a silicon substrate as the sample holder due to its reflective properties in the visible region and transparency in the MIR region. This allows us to collect the beam reflected from the silicon substrate—which contains forward-scattered light from the sample—through the same objective lens. Thus, there is no need to sandwich the sample between two closely positioned immersion-based objective lenses, as this would hinder the delivery of MIR light to the sample. In our system, the MIR light can be delivered through the silicon substrate from the opposite side of the objective lens. Please see theMethodsfor more details on the optical system for image acquisition. We demonstrated MIR spectroscopic imaging at 175 nm FWHM of the PSF or 120 nm spatial resolution of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. To this end, we performed hyperspectral MIP-QPI of our custom-made spatial-resolution test chart (seeMethodsand Supplementary Note6for details) in the peak wavenumber range between 2,650 and 3,150 cm−1, with 10 cm−1increments. Figure2ashows a side-by-side comparison of the smallest resolvable set of bars obtained with the MIR light turned off (optical-phase-delay (OPD) contrast) or on (MIP contrast at 2,920 or 3,150 cm−1). This comparison illustrates that the MIP images possess spatial resolving power nearly equivalent to that of the standard synthetic-aperture QPI. Figure2bpresents the broadband MIP spectra obtained from one of the bars and the background water, clearly visualizing the difference in vibrational resonance between the two materials. This allows us to estimate that the positive contrast of the test chart in the 2,920 cm−1MIP image (Fig.2a) corresponds to the vibrational resonance of the CH2stretching modes present in the organic resist, whereas its negative contrast in the 3,150 cm−1MIP image (Fig.2a) reflects the stronger vibrational resonance of the background water. By employing the multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm24, we can decompose the spectral image dataset into two meaningful spectral components, as shown in Fig.2c,d. The retrieved MCR spectra displayed in Fig.2eindicate that the component labelled as MCR1 represents the vibrational signature of C–H stretching modes, featuring two characteristic peaks at 2,850 and 2,920 cm−1. On the other hand, the other component, labelled as MCR2, represents the vibrational signature of water, exhibiting increasing vibrational resonance in the higher wavenumber region. Furthermore, the enlarged insets in Fig.2c,dshow that the three bars remain resolved in the two MCR images. a, Smallest resolvable set of bars obtained with the MIR light turned off (OPD contrast) or on (MIP contrast at 2,920 or 3,150 cm−1).

The three bars remain resolved in these images.e, Retrieved spectra of the two MCR components. The spectrum of MCR1 clearly exhibits the vibrational signature of C–H stretching modes with peaks at 2,850 and 2,920 cm−1, whereas the spectrum of MCR2 displays increasing vibrational resonance in the higher wavenumber region, a characteristic feature of water.f, Analysis of the line profiles of the smallest resolvable set of bars in the MIP image at 2,920 cm−1, and the MCR1 image. The profiles are taken on the white dashed lines in the middle panel inaand the inset inc. The dashed curves indicate Gaussian fits with an HWHM of (left) 92 and (right) 83 nm, respectively.g, Spatial-frequency spectra of the MIP images at (left) 2,650 and (right) 2,920 cm−1. The colour scale represents the logarithm of the absolute value of each spatial frequency component. To quantitatively evaluate the spatial resolution of our spectroscopic SOSA-MIP-QPI system, the line profiles of the smallest resolvable set of bars in the MIP and MCR images are analysed in Fig.2f. The profiles show that the three bars with a centre-to-centre spacing of ~270 nm are clearly resolved, indicating that the system offers the Nyquist–Shannon sampling resolution of at least 135 nm. Considering the probe wavelength of 532 nm, this resolution corresponds to a synthetic NA of 1.97. We also show the spectra of the non-resonant and resonant MIP images in Fig.2gto demonstrate that our system fully utilizes the designed synthetic NA of 2.2. From these images, it is evident that our SOSA-MIP-QPI system fully utilizes the designed synthetic NA. Specifically, the MIR-resonant, sample-specific signals observed in the 2,920 cm−1spectrum extend to the edges of the synthetic aperture as indicated by the white arrows, providing a bandwidth that corresponds to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling resolution of 121 nm. Furthermore, to derive the spatial resolution of our system in terms of FWHM of the PSF, we also analysed the line profiles of the left and right bars shown in Fig.2f. These profiles can be fitted with a Gaussian function with a half-width at half-maximum of 92 and 83 nm, respectively, indicating that the spatial resolution of our system corresponds to ~175 nm in terms of FWHM when an infinitesimal object is imaged. This resolution agrees well with the FWHM of the PSF for the synthetic aperture of our imaging system (see Supplementary Fig.7in Supplementary Note7), which also indicates that our spectroscopic SOSA-MIP-QPI system fully uses the synthetic NA of 2.2. The spatial resolution of 175 nm in FWHM represents the highest standard in far-field super-resolution MIR imaging (see Discussion for details). We performed two biological experiments to further demonstrate the utility of our SOSA-MIP-QPI in practical applications (see Supplementary Note8for an experiment on MIR spectroscopic analysis of bacterial intracellular structures). Here we show how this microscope serves as a label-free and quantitative tool to detect variations in the concentration and distribution of intracellular biochemical components across different bacterial groups. To this end, we performed MIR spectroscopic imaging on two bacterial species,Escherichia coliandRhodococcus jostiiRHA1. The latter is an oleaginous bacterial species rich in lipids such as triacylglycerols, potentially serving as a starting material for biodiesel development25. It is known that the biosynthesis and accumulation of lipids inRhodococcus jostii(R. jostii) RHA1 are promoted under nitrogen-deficient conditions26. In our experiment, we imaged and analysed the spectro-microscopic differences among three bacterial groups: (1)Escherichia coli(E. coli) and (2)R. jostiiRHA1 cultured in nitrogen-rich and (3) -deficient conditions (seeMethodsfor the detailed culture conditions). Figure3a,d,gshows OPD images ofE. coliandR. jostiiRHA1 (nitrogen-rich and -deficient), whereas Fig.3b,e,hand Fig.3c,f,ipresent MIP images at MIR wavenumbers of 2,920 and 3,000 cm−1, respectively, which are resonant and non-resonant with the CH2anti-symmetric stretching modes in lipid molecules, respectively. By comparing their MIP images, we can analyse differences in lipid concentration and distribution among these three bacterial groups. Note that the broad absorption band of CH3anti-symmetric stretching modes—typically seen in protein molecules—is observed at both MIR wavenumbers. Our comparison reveals that theR. jostiiRHA1 cells under nitrogen-rich conditions show strong, localized signals only in the 2,920 cm−1MIP image (Fig.3e,f), whereas theE. colicell shows almost identical MIP-signal distributions at both wavenumbers (Fig.3b,c). In Fig.3e, tiny particle-like structures as small as the diffraction limit of 175 nm, reminiscent of lipid droplets, are observed. A cross-section of one such particle is shown in Fig.3j. These tiny structures, resembling lipid droplets, are not evident in the OPD image (Fig.3d) but are visualized in the 2,920 cm−1MIP image. Figure3kpresents the MIP spectra of these bacteria, measured at locations indicated by white arrows in Fig.3b,e,h, obtained by normalizing the raw MIP signal with the corresponding MIR pulse energy. The MIP spectrum in theE. colicell shows the characteristic profile of proteins with broad absorption peaks around 2,860 and 2,950 cm−1. By contrast, the spectrum from the lipid-droplet-like structure in theR. jostiiRHA1 cell exhibits narrower, sharp absorption peaks at 2,860 and 2,920 cm−1, characteristic of lipids. a–i, Images, obtained via SOSA-MIP-QPI, ofE. coli(a–c), as well asR. jostiiRHA1 (d–i) cultured under nitrogen-rich (d–f) and nitrogen-deficient (g–i) conditions.

Inlandm, the data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. The images of the cells analysed inlandmare shown in Supplementary Note10. To statistically verify the above-mentioned trend, we measured 8–13 cells for each bacterial group and confirmed the presence of the same spectral signatures (see Supplementary Note10for details). Figure3lshows the ratios of the single-cell-averaged intracellular MIP signals at 2,920 cm−1to those at 2,960 cm−1. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests revealed that these ratios are statistically different betweenE. coliandR. jostiiRHA1, with adjustedP-values of less than 0.0001. TheE. colicells have a mean ratio of 0.98, indicating broad absorption resonance between 2,920 and 2,960 cm−1, characteristic of the CH3anti-symmetric modes in proteins. By contrast, theR. jostiiRHA1 cells show mean ratios of 1.88 and 2.73 for the nitrogen-rich and -deficient conditions, respectively, indicating strong resonances at 2,920 cm−1, which are characteristic of the CH2anti-symmetric modes in lipids. Moreover, the higher ratios observed inR. jostiiRHA1 cells under nitrogen-deficient compared with nitrogen-rich conditions suggest an increased proportion of lipid molecules within each cell of the former group. We also analysed lipid amounts inR. jostiiRHA1 cells cultured under nitrogen-rich and -deficient conditions to further verify this observation. The size and intensity of localized signals in the 2,920 cm−1MIP images are larger under the nitrogen-deficient condition (Fig.3h,e). Figure3mdisplays the normalized single-cell-averaged MIP signals at 2,920 cm−1for these cells. Through two-tailed unpaired Student’st-test, we found these signals to be statistically different by a mean factor of ~3, with aP-value less than 0.0001, suggesting the promoted biosynthesis and accumulation of lipids in cells cultured under the nitrogen-deficient condition. To the best of our knowledge, the spatial resolution reported in this work (that is, 175 nm in terms of the FWHM) is at the highest standard among far-field super-resolution MIR imaging methods. Although most of the existing far-field MIR imaging methods offer FWHM resolutions of above 200 nm (refs.3,4,27,28), the higher-order harmonic lock-in detection technique15has reported noisy MIP images that show FWHM resolutions of 120 nm and smaller. However, we believe that the technique’s spatial resolution must be provided by the convolution between the spot size of the focused probe beam and the spatial distribution of some physical parameter of interest which, in this case, reflects the thermal decay constant. Therefore, although the higher-order harmonic lock-in detection improves the spatial resolution by mitigating the heat diffusion effect, the limit in the achievable spatial resolution must be provided by the diffraction limit of the probe beam focus, which is ~170 nm in FWHM with a wavelength of 405 nm and NA of 1.2. In this respect, our SOSA-MIP-QPI method offers state-of-the-art MIP spatial resolution. Our SOSA-MIP-QPI method still has room for improvement in the spatial resolution. First, our experimental synthetic-aperture QPI system may contain aberration induced by the optical components. Hence, the contrasts of the obtained images are not ideal in either the OPD image acquired with the MIR light turned off or the MIP image (see Supplementary Note11for details). This issue can be readily solved by using a complex deconvolution technique6, which can be easily applied to various types of samples if a beam-stirring mechanism is installed29. We note that the existence of aberration in our experimental set-up does not necessarily contradict the visible-diffraction-limited spatial resolution claimed in Fig.2and Supplementary Note7. Deconvolution of the MIP image by the OPD image cancels out the contrast-degradation effect due to aberration and reveals that the resolution-degradation effect caused by the photothermal heat diffusion in the resulting PSF is negligible in our system. Second, the spatial resolution of synthetic-aperture QPI can be further improved by employing a shorter probe wavelength of, for example, 400 nm and an oil-based immersion objective lens with a higher NA of, for example, 1.49. This leads to a Nyquist–Shannon sampling or FWHM resolution down to 67 or 97 nm, respectively (see Supplementary Note12for details). Even at this extreme spatial resolution, our current pulse durations of 0.5 ns can confine the heat diffusion from a point scatterer within a range much below the visible diffraction limit and enable accomplishment of the visible-diffraction-limited MIP imaging (see Supplementary Note13for details). The spatial resolution of 100 nm presents a challenging milestone for optical imaging, representing the threshold that distinguishes nanoscopy from microscopy6. Our technique could therefore potentially open the door to far-field MIR nanoscopy. Finally, we compare our SOSA-MIP-QPI with state-of-the-art far-field MIR imaging techniques. Although several far-field MIP imaging techniques have recently demonstrated high-speed capability22,27,28,30, achieving high spatial resolution at a nanoscopic level remains challenging without substantially sacrificing measurement speed. For example, in the higher-order harmonic lock-in detection scheme employed in the super-resolution far-field MIR imaging technique15, the signal intensity—and hence the imaging speed—are considerably decreased because the probe photons are temporally distributed due to the use of continuous-wave light. By contrast, our SOSA-MIP-QPI uses a nanosecond pump–probe measurement scheme that enables the optimal temporal confinement of the probe photons, allowing them to sense only the non-diffused photothermal signals. As a result, our approach achieves a MIP imaging speed of less than 1 min per frame, ~60 times faster than the prior art, with a state-of-the-art spatial resolution of 175 nm in FWHM. Moreover, by incorporating a faster angle-scanning mechanism of visible light31as well as an image sensor with a higher saturation capacity accompanied by an increased visible optical power22, it is possible to achieve an additional order of magnitude improvement in imaging speed. We performed a numerical study to determine the requirements for the temporal pulse duration of the MIR and visible light sources needed to achieve the visible-diffraction-limited MIP-QPI at nanoscopic spatial resolution. We simulated heat diffusion from a 100 nm spherical object with a refractive index of 1.4 placed in water, excited by a MIR pulse with various pulse widths. We then simulated MIP-QPI images using the obtained 3D temperature-rise distribution and our experimental parameters. Finally, we estimated the pulse width that provided the visible-diffraction-limited MIP-QPI performance. As the simulated system was spherically symmetric, we used the one-dimensional heat conduction equation in the radial dimension given by32 whereT,r,tandvare the temperature, radial coordinate, time and thermal diffusivity, respectively. Among various methods33,34for solving equation (1), we employed the forward time-centered method32with the temperature at the radial origin calculated by The thermal diffusivities of the object and water35were assumed to be 0.146 μm2s–1. The spatial and temporal resolutions of the simulation were 1 nm and 0.1 ns, respectively. The length in the radial dimension of our simulation space was 500 nm. We simulated two cases in which the MIR pulse width was 0.5 or 5 ns in FWHM with a Gaussian profile. The visible pulse had the same width and profile as the MIR pulse. The rising edge (1/e2level of the peak power) of the visible pulse coincides with the falling edge (1/e2level of the peak power) of the MIR pulse. We used the angular-spectrum method36to simulate synthetic-aperture MIP images with the following parameters: a wavelength of 532 nm, collection NA of 1.2, illumination NA of 1.0, lateral sampling resolution of 10 nm, wave-propagation resolution of 10 nm, and refractive index of 1.33 for water. The resolution-degradation effect due to photothermal heat diffusion was evaluated in reference to the synthetic aperture OPD image. The obtained results indicate that the pulse width of 0.5 or 5 ns results in degradation of the spatial resolution by ~1 or ~10 nm, respectively, for the 100 nm object (see Supplementary Note1for details). We therefore confirm that using a subnanosecond pulse is crucial for achieving visible-diffraction-limited MIP imaging. The visible pulses are obtained through second harmonic generation using a 30-mm-long lithium triborate crystal. The resultant 532 nm pulses were then coupled into a single-mode optical fibre. The MIR pulses were produced with our home-made optical parametric oscillator based on a 50-mm-long, fan-out, magnesium-oxide-doped, periodically poled lithium niobate (MgO:PPLN) crystal, allowing for tuning of the idler MIR light in the region of 2,600–3,200 cm−1(3.12–3.85 μm) through mechanical scanning of the crystal’s position (see Supplementary Notes2and3for details). Finally, the output of MIR pulse train is intensity modulated at 35.7 Hz (1/28th harmonic of the 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency) by a mechanical chopper. A detailed schematic of the laser system can be found in Supplementary Note2. We confirmed that the visible and MIR pulses had subnanosecond pulse durations of ~0.5 ns in the FWHM (see Supplementary Note3for details). The optical path length of the MIR beam is adjusted such that the visible pulse arrives at the falling edge of the MIR pulse at the sample plane (Fig.1a). The MIR pulses exhibit pulse energies between 0.6 and 1.7 μJ, and spectral bandwidths between 15 and 50 cm−1in FWHM, depending on the wavenumber, and can resolve C–H stretching vibrational signatures between 2,700 and 3,100 cm−1(see Supplementary Note3for details). QPI measures the visible complex-field image consisting of amplitude and OPD distributions. The MIP-QPI17,18,19,20,22technique therefore quantifies local refractive-index changes occurring in the vicinity of MIR absorbers due to the MIP effect while also revealing the morphology of transparent objects. The MIP contrast is determined by measuring the OPD distributions induced by the sample when the MIR light is turned on and off, followed by taking the difference between these two images. We can perform aperture synthesis to improve the spatial resolution of QPI. In this method, the sample is illuminated by a plane wave with an angle relative to the objective lens’ detection plane, which shifts the centre position of the objective lens’ circular bandpass filter with respect to the sample’s spatial frequency spectrum (Fig.1d). This lets us probe the higher-frequency contents that cannot be accessed with normal illumination. By scanning the azimuthal angle of the illumination, the position of the shifted bandpass filter is also rotated around the zero-frequency point of the sample’s spectrum, facilitating the measurement of different high-frequency regions. Using these multiple images captured under different illumination vectors, we can numerically synthesize a virtual imaging aperture with a larger spatial-frequency bandwidth than the physical bandwidth of the objective lens. This results in a higher spatial resolution in the final reconstructed image. Our SOSA-MIP-QPI builds on the unique computational image-reconstruction procedure for retrieving artefact-free MIP images. The absorption of MIR light by the immersion medium and/or the objective lens results in the local photothermal alteration of the pupil function of the imaging system, causing the undesired non-sample-specific artefact in the MIP image. Our SOSA-MIP-QPI solves this issue by harnessing the data redundancy and computational nature of aperture synthesis. Specifically, the altered region of the pupil function is computationally discarded. Meanwhile, the spatial-frequency contents lost in one angular measurement from the sample are complemented by other angular measurements, where the same frequency contents are probed in the unaltered region of the pupil function. Note that such computational engineering of the pupil function is not straightforward with either wide-field or point-scanning intensity-based imaging techniques, such as bright-field, phase-contrast and dark-field imaging, but is an advantageous capability of QPI, which performs complex-field imaging. Details on the SOSA-MIP-QPI reconstruction procedure can be found in Supplementary Notes4and5. The light collected by the objective lens is separated from the original beam path using a PBS in conjugation with a quarter-wave plate. An intermediate image is formed by a subsequent lens with a magnification rate of 66.7. An additional 4f system installed in the following path further magnifies the image by a factor of five, resulting in a total magnification rate of 333.3. This high magnification rate helps in detecting more photons per diffraction limit with increased optical illumination, thereby reducing the OPD noise in QPI governed by the optical shot noise. The sample and reference arms are recombined by a PBS, with a polarizer extracting the same polarization from the two arms of the interferometer. In the reference arm, the beam diameter, the optical path length and the angle of the reference beam relative to the sample beam are optimized to maximize interferometric visibility. Finally, the interferogram is captured by an image sensor at a rate of 71.4 Hz (1/14th harmonic of the 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency), allowing for alternate probing of MIR-on and -off states for each illuminating angle. The difference between on–off states reveals the MIP contrast. To avoid undesired non-sample-specific artefacts in the MIP image, we implemented the computational pupil function engineering as described above. Each MIP image consisting of 135 pixels × 135 pixels with a Nyquist–Shannon sampling resolution of 121 nm per pixel was measured in less than 1 min to achieve a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. This measurement time is more than an order of magnitude shorter than that of the state-of-the-art far-field super-resolution MIR imaging technique15, which requires ~200 ms pixel dwell time, equivalent to 1 h for a single image. The repetition rate of the light sources, the frame rate of the image sensor (acA2440-75um, Basler), and the frequency of the mechanical chopper are synchronized. Specifically, the pulse repetition rate (1 kHz) serves as the master clock of the entire system. The image sensor and the mechanical chopper operate at the 1/14th harmonic (71.4 Hz) and 1/28th harmonic (35.7 Hz) frequencies, respectively. This allows the image sensor to alternately record the MIR-on and -off states. Each raw interferogram is processed to retrieve the complex-field image on a computer. The on–off difference in the phase of the complex-field images is calculated to reveal the MIP contrast. A custom-made program was developed to automate the entire measurement process, including the rotation of the wedge prism, scanning of the MgO:PPLN crystal, and image acquisition and recording. Typical MIP spectroscopic image acquisition took ~30 min to complete for measuring with eight azimuthal illumination angles (with 45° increments) at 31 spectral points between 2,600 and 3,200 cm−1with a spectral resolution of 20 cm−1and a frame-averaging number of 200 (or acquisition of 400 raw images) for each azimuthal angle. The specific imaging conditions for each experiment are summarized here. In the experiments shown in Fig.2and Supplementary Fig.7, we used eight azimuthal illumination angles (with 45° increments) with a spectral resolution of 10 cm−1and a frame-averaging number of 200 (corresponding to 400 raw images) for each azimuthal angle. For the experiments shown in Fig.3, we used eight azimuthal illumination angles (with 45° increments) with a spectral resolution of 20 cm−1and a frame-averaging number for each azimuthal angle of 600 (corresponding to 1,200 raw images) for theE. coliand nitrogen-richR. jostiiRHA1 samples, or 300 (corresponding to 600 raw images) for the nitrogen-deficientR. jostiiRHA1 sample. For the experiment shown in Supplementary Fig.8, we used four azimuthal illumination angles (90° increments) with a spectral resolution of 20 cm−1and a frame-averaging number of 200 (corresponding to 400 raw images) for each azimuthal angle. In the experiments shown in Fig.2, and Supplementary Figs.7and8, the maximum MIR pulse energies were used, as summarized in Supplementary Note3. In the experiment shown in Fig.3, the MIR pulse energies were adjusted to ~0.25 μJ on average in the wavenumber range between 2,800 and 3,000 cm−1. The custom-made spatial-resolution test chart was fabricated using electron-beam lithography. A 520-μm-thick silicon substrate (4-520P1FMM, AKD, Japan) was coated with an electron beam resist (OEBR-CAN 2.0cp) by spin coating (3,000 r.p.m., 60 s) and baked at 110 °C for 1 min. The structures were patterned using a rapid electron beam lithography system (F7000SVD02, Advantest) and then baked at 130 °C for 1 min. The OEBR-CAN 2.0cp was developed with NMD-W for 1 min and cleaned with deionized water. Finally, the sample was baked at 90 °C for 90 s. Escherichia colicells (C2987, New England Biolabs) were cultured in a test tube (222-2393-080, Caplugs) with 3 ml of Luria–Bertani medium (244620, BD Biosciences) at 37 °C for 18 h while shaking at 200 r.p.m. (IC101W, Yamato Scientific Company); 1 ml of the resulting liquid sample was transferred to a 1.5 ml tube (003012086, Eppendorf) and washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline solution (045-29795, Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemicals) three times with a centrifuge operating at 10,000 G for 1 min in every wash. To fix the bacterial cells, the tube was centrifuged again, the supernatant was removed, 4% paraformaldehyde fixative (33111, Muto Pure Chemicals) was added, and the tube was left on ice for 10 min. Finally, the fixed cells were washed three times by phosphate buffered saline solution. Rhodococcus jostiiRHA1 cells (108803, Biological Resource Center, National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, Japan) were cultured in the test tube with 4 ml of the Luria–Bertani medium at 30 °C for 95 h while shaking at 200 r.p.m. These cells represent those cultured under the nitrogen-rich condition; 250 μl of the resulting liquid sample was added to 5 ml of mineral salts medium37with 0.1 g l–1of ammonium chloride used as the sole nitrogen source and 1% (w/v) sodium gluconate and 0.5% (w/v) glucose used as the sole carbon sources. All reagents used to create the mineral salts medium were purchased from Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemicals. The cells were then cultured at 30 °C for 48 h while shaking at 200 r.p.m. These cells represent those cultured under the nitrogen-deficient condition. For each condition, the liquid was transferred to a 10 ml tube (MS-90150, Sumitomo Bakelite Company), the tube was centrifuged at 10,000 G for 1 min, the supernatant was removed and the cells were frozen using liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C overnight. Each sample was then dissolved in 500 μl of phosphate buffered saline solution in a 1.5 ml tube (MS-4256M, Sumitomo Bakelite Company). The cells were washed twice by phosphate buffered saline solution with a centrifuge operating at 10,000 G for 1 min in every wash. To fix the bacterial cells, the tube was centrifuged again, the supernatant was removed, the 4% paraformaldehyde fixative was added, and the tube was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the fixed cells were washed three times by phosphate buffered saline solution. The cell-specific MIP signals were extracted by subtracting the water’s background MIP signals19. Specifically, the water’s MIP images were measured at an empty area of the sample where no cells existed, which was then subtracted from the cell’s MIP images that contained the background water’s MIP signals. To derive the normalized MIP spectra, these MIP images were then divided by the pulse energy at the corresponding MIR wavenumber measured by a power meter. The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v.938. An example set of data for SOSA-MIP-QPI can be found athttps://github.com/takuroideguchi/SOSA-MIP-QPI_2024_demo.

Mid-infrared microscopy is typically limited by its low resolution, especially when compared to other microscopy techniques. This latest development produced images at 120 nanometers, which the researchers say is a thirtyfold improvement on the resolution of typical mid-infrared microscopes. Being able to view samples more clearly at this smaller scale can aid multiple fields of research, including into infectious diseases, and opens the way for developing even more accurate mid-infrared-based imaging in the future.
The microscopic realm is where viruses, proteins and molecules dwell. Thanks to modern microscopes, we can venture down to see the inner workings of our very own cells. But even these impressive tools have limitations. For example, super-resolution fluorescent microscopes require specimens to be labeled with fluorescence. This can sometimes be toxic to samples and extended light exposure while viewing can bleach samples, meaning they are no longer useful. Electron microscopes can also provide very impressive details, but samples must be placed in a vacuum, so live samples cannot be studied.
By comparison, mid-infrared microscopy can provide both chemical and structural information about live cells, without needing to color or damage them. However, its use has been limited in biological research because of its comparatively low resolution capability. While super-resolution fluorescent microscopy can narrow down images to tens of nanometers (1 nanometer being one-millionth of a millimeter), mid-infrared microscopy can typically only achieve around 3 microns (1 micron being one-thousandth of a millimeter).
However, in a new breakthrough, researchers at the University of Tokyo have attained a higher resolution of mid-infrared microscopy than ever before. “We achieved a spatial resolution of 120 nanometers, that is, 0.12 microns. This amazing resolution is roughly 30 times better than that of conventional mid-infrared microscopy,” explained Professor Takuro Ideguchi from the Institute for Photon Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo.
The team used a “synthetic aperture,” a technique combining several images taken from different illuminated angles to create a clearer overall picture. Typically, a sample is sandwiched between two lenses. The lenses, however, inadvertently absorb some of the mid-infrared light. They solved this issue by placing a sample, bacteria (E. coliandRhodococcus jostiiRHA1 were used), on a silicon plate which reflected visible light and transmitted infrared light. This allowed the researchers to use a single lens, enabling them to better illuminate the sample with the mid-infrared light and get a more detailed image.
“We were surprised at how clearly we could observe the intracellular structures of bacteria. The high spatial resolution of our microscope could allow us to study, for example, antimicrobial resistance, which is a worldwide issue,” said Ideguchi. “We believe we can continue to improve the technique in various directions. If we use a better lens and a shorter wavelength of visible light, the spatial resolution could even be below 100 nanometers.

Incorporating nature-based components into coastal defences may enhance adaptation to climate change with added benefits, but we need to compare their performance against conventional hard measures. We conduct a meta-analysis that compares the performances of hard, hybrid, soft and natural measures for coastal defence across different functions of risk reduction, climate change mitigation, and cost-effectiveness. Hybrid and soft measures offer higher risk reduction and climate change mitigation benefits than unvegetated natural systems, while performing on par with natural measures. Soft and hybrid measures are more cost-effective than hard measures, while hybrid measures provide the highest hazard reduction among all measures. All coastal defence measures have a positive economic return over a 20-year period. Mindful of risk context, our results provide strong an evidence-base for integrating and upscaling nature-based components into coastal defences in lower risk areas. Coastal areas contain about 40% of the world’s population and three-quarters of the large cities1. Climate change-induced disasters from sea-level rise, increased climate variability, and more frequent/intense droughts, floods, and storms, significantly threaten coastal communities globally2,3. The high-end risk scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) estimates increases in the magnitude and frequency of tropical cyclones and a 2-m sea-level rise by 21004. This suggests a strong need for effective coastal defence in order to keep pace with accelerated climate change5. Traditional approaches to coastal defence include hard engineering measures such as breakwaters, dikes, dams, groins, and levees (called hard measures for the remainder of the paper)6. However, their maintenance costs could be extremelly high under future climate change scenarios when considering needs for continuous upgrades/repairs7. The annual cost globally for dikes alone could be USD 12-71 billion by 21008. Coastal defence options that contain natural components have received attention as more sustainable and cost-effective measures compared to conventional hard measures9. These encompass very diverse natural, soft and hybrid measures that are collectively called “Nature-based solutions” (NbS). Natural measures include coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, or tidal marshes situated between coastal communities and the lowest tides, which protect against hazards such as sea level rise and coastal flooding from storm surges and high waves10. Soft measures utilise natural ecosystems and the environment to reduce coastal risks and achieve coastal defence and adaptation10, and can entail the restoration, rehabilitation, reforestation, and plantation of such marine ecosystems and/or beach nourishment and sand dune planting. Hybrid measures combine hard engineering structures and soft measures (e.g. breakwaters in front of saltmarshes or mangroves), essentially offering hybrid engineering-natural solutions for coastal protection and adaptation11. It has been argued that, by virtue of their ability to self-adapt as living systems, NbS (whether natural, soft, or hybrid measures) can be more cost-effective alternatives to hard measures for coastal defence under a changing climate12,13. Furthermore, adopting NbS for coastal defence can conserve and restore natural habitats that provide multiple ecosystem services, including food and carbon sequestration14. Beyond climate change adaptation, some NbS for coastal defence can contribute to climate change mitigation and human wellbeing. However, their wider adoption is still limited, and not often advocated as a standard approach to coastal defence11. Optimum approaches to coastal defence and adaptation depend on local context-specific factors. Importantly, optimum approacher are arguably unlikely to rely exclusively on hard, hybrid, soft, or natural approaches7,15, but will likely consist of rather diverse portfolios of options that carefully consider risk urgency, risk intensity, and the local context15. Robust global comparisons about the performance of hard, hybrid, soft, and natural measures for coastal defence and climate change adaptation (and the influencing factors) are particularly needed. Such comparative knowledge can inform decision-making for coastal infrastructures, facilitate the sharing of best practices, and provide guidelines for building sustainable and resilient coastal communities7. The current global evidence about the comparative performance of natural, soft, hybrid, and hard measures for coastal defence and adaptation in the English language literature is rather fragmented. First, to date, most research comparing their performance is usually restricted to specific study areas, functions (e.g. wave attenuation16, shoreline stabilisation17) and/or the underlying costs/benefits18. Second, there is generally clear evidence about the effectiveness of hard measures for coastal defence19,20, but less so for NbS. Third, the rapid loss globally of natural habitats with adaptation potential creates opportunities for ecosystem restoration via hybrid and soft measures21,22, but there are knowledge gaps about the performance of restored habitats as part of soft and hybrid measures for risk reduction and climate change mitigation. Systematic syntheses of the performance of soft and hybrid measures for coastal defence is limited, as is the evidence of how such measures perform compared to natural habitats and conventional hard measures. Most previous systematic reviews of coastal defence options relied on the narrative-based meta-synthesis of empirical studies10,11Though valuable, such studies are also limited by their inability to deal with the statistical variation in outcomes between studies23. Conversely, quantitative meta-analyses can be informative and robust when comparing outcomes from multiple studies23. Here, we present a global multi-dimensional meta-analysis that compares the performance of four coastal defence options (hard, hybrid, soft, and natural measures) for coastal adaptation. It utilises insights mainly from the peer-reviewed literature and secondarily from grey literature. We focus on three performance dimensions, namely risk reduction, climate change mitigation, and cost-effectiveness. First, we compare the risk reduction and mitigation performances of coastal defences that entail human interventions (i.e. hard, hybrid, soft measures) with two comparative bases (natural measures and unvegetated natural systems) Second, we compare the performance between hybrid, soft, and hard measures Third, we examine the effect of different ecosystem types and baseline level of risks on the performance of NbS; Fourth, we quantify the costs and benefits associated with these coastal defence measures over a 20-year period. Our results provide an evidence base to guide decision-making for coastal defence and climate change adaptation, with important implications for policy, practice and future research. We identified 304 studies assessing the effectiveness and performance of coastal defence options, with 39% (N= 119) reporting risk reduction, 24.7% (N= 75) reporting climate change mitigation, and 36.3 % (N= 110) reporting costs/benefits. Supplementary Fig.7(Supplementary Materials) shows the geographical distribution of the reviewed studies. The studies span 55 countries and territories, in North America (36.6%), Asia (35.5%), Europe (13.4%), Oceania (10.7%), Africa (2.3%) and Central/South America (1.5%). Collectively, the studies contain 875 observations about the effectiveness of coastal defence options, including 585 observations (66.9%) on soft measures, 187 observations (21.4%) on hybrid measures, and 103 observations (11.8%) on hard measures (see Supplementary Data1). The meta-analysis compared the performance of coastal defence options that entail human interventions (i.e soft, hybrid, hard measures) with two comparative bases that lack conscious human effort towards adaptation (i.e. natural measures, unvegetated natural systems). We compared physical performance across two dimensions, namely risk reduction and climate change mitigation. Risk reduction encompasses the functions of wave attenuation (at high and low wave energy level), shoreline stabilisation, accretion change, elevation change, and sediment accumulation, while climate change mitigation functions include carbon storage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (see Methods). Compared to natural measures (e.g. natural saltmarshes, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds), soft, hybrid, and hard measures have similar overall performance, although several notable differences were observed for individual functions. When comparing “soft vs. natural”, 236 observations from 72 studies (Fig.1a) suggest that soft measures are on aggregate much more effective in risk reduction (Standard Mean Difference SMD = 1.73, 95% Confidence Intervals 95%CIs = 0.13–3.34, number of observationn= 61), particularly for accretion (SMD = 2.21, 95% CIs=0.17–4.25,n= 26) and elevation change (SMD = 2.53, 95%CIs=0.31–4.74,n= 19). Regarding climate change mitigation, the levels of carbon storage (SMD = −0.13, 95%CIs = −0.89–0.63,n= 100) and GHG emissions (SMD = −0.03, 95%CIs = −0.94–0.89,n= 74) do not differ substantially between soft and natural measures. aSoft vs. natural,bHybrid vs. natural,cHard vs. natural,dSoft vs. unvegetated natural systems,eHybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems,fHard vs. unvegetated natural systems,gHybrid vs. soft, andhHybrid vs. hard. Hedges’ g was used to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) between two coastal defence options. If the bar falls into the positive side of the plot, we interpreted that the coastal defence option on the left of ‘vs.’ provides the given function at a higher level than the option on the right of ‘vs.’. Conversely, if the bar falls into the negative side means the opposite. Ina–fthe first numbers in parentheses indicate the number of observations and the second numbers in parentheses indicate the number of studies included in each calculation. Carbon storage and GHG emissions are not available for hard measures and are noted by ‘N/A’. Ranges indicated with ‘#’ ina–fdenote functions with small number of observations that require cautious interpretation and generalisation. Due to data limitations, we followed an indirect comparison between soft, hybrid, and hard measures. Ing,h, SMD was calculated based on sample size (number of reviewed studies), mean (estimated SMD from the previous meta-data analysis), and standard deviation between two paired groups: vs. “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems” vs. “soft vs unvegetated natural systems” and “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems” vs. “hard vs. unvegetated natural systems” (see Methods). When comparing “hybrid vs. natural”, 38 observations from 18 studies (Fig.1b) indicate that hybrid measures exhibit similar overall performance compared to natural measures for risk reduction functions (SMD = 1.22, 95%CIs = −1.07–3.51,n= 29). There were no major differences for wave attenuation at low wave energy conditions (SMD = 5.43, 95%CIs = −4.92–15.42,n= 5), elevation change (SMD = −0.15, 95%CIs = −3.84–3.55,n= 13), sediment accumulation (SMD = 3.34, 95%CIs = −1.13–7.81,n= 10). However, hybrid measures are much less effective for carbon storage than natural habitats (SMD = −1.51, 95%CIs = −3.00–0.02,n= 9) (see Supplementary Data). When comparing “hard vs. natural” (Fig.1.c), these defence options exhibit similar performances in terms of overall risk reduction (SMD = −2.26, 95%Cis = −6.43–1.91,n= 12) and overall shoreline response (SMD = −0.03, 95%Cis = −6.43–1.91,n= 6). Hard measures perform worse when compared to natural measures for wave attenuation in low wave energy conditions (SMD = −0.97, 95% CIs = −1.84 – −0.09,n= 5). However, considering the limited number of observations and studies, the findings of our meta-analysis for these group comparisons should be interpreted with caution. Climate change mitigation functions are not available for hard measures (see Methods). Compared to unvegetated natural systems (e.g. tidal flats, bare land), hard, hybrid, and soft measures have on aggregate, a much better performance for adaptation. In total, 126 observations from 47 studies compare the performance of “soft vs. unvegetated natural systems”. For risk reduction functions, soft measures perform better for elevation change (SMD = 3.70, 95% CIs = 1.05–6.34,n= 12), sediment accumulation (SMD = 1.68, 95%CIs = 0.08-3.27, n = 8), and wave attenuation (overall SMD = 6.02, 95%CIs = 0.76–11.29,n= 25) at both high and low wave energy levels. Regarding climate change mitigation, restored habitats from soft measures are much more effective in carbon storage (SMD = 5.98, 95%CIs = 0.50–11.47,n= 38) but emit significantly higher amounts of GHGs (SMD = −1.47, 95%CIs = −2.21 to −0.72,n= 10) than unvegetated natural systems. To compare “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems”, the results indicate on aggregate the much better performance of hybrid measures (SMD = 5.89, 95%CIs = 2.50-9.27, n = 62) (Fig.1e). These patterns are also visible for individual risk reduction functions such as sediment accumulation (SMD = 1.68, 95%CIs = 0.08-3.27, n = 8) and elevation change (SMD = 0.54 95%CIs = 0.33–0.75,n= 24). For wave attenuation, hybrid measures are much more effective in low wave energy conditions (SMD = 9.01, 95%CIs = 3.89–14.13,n= 31) than in high wave energy conditions (SMD = 0.63, n = 1) (note that the latter comparison is based on only one observation and should be interpreted cautiously). For climate change mitigation, we did not find any relevant studies for comparing GHG emissions. For the carbon storage function, we found only one study that indicates that restored habitats from hybrid measures have higher carbon sequestration than unvegetated natural systems (SMD = 0.96). Due to the low number of observations, this finding should be interpreted with caution. We could only compare the performance of “hard vs. unvegetated natural systems” for risk reduction functions but not climate change mitigation functions (see Methods for explanation). Figure1fsuggests that when compared to unvegetated natural systems from 41 observations of 17 studies, hard measures provide greater risk reduction (SMD = 3.40, 95%CIs = 2.78–6.06,n= 41). Similarly, the performance of hard measures is substantially better for most individual functions: accretion change (SMD = 2.55, 95%CIs = 0.12–4.97,n= 14), sedimentation accumulation (SMD = 1.37, 95%CIs = 0.69–2.04,n= 4), and overall shoreline response (SMD = 2.01, 95%CIs = 0.82–3.20,n= 22). These results essentially confirm what we know, namely that the hard structures are designed very specifically for risk reduction and therefore perform well for these functions despite the fact that they do not perform well for other desired functions such as climate mitigation. For the wave attenuation function, hard measures perform much better in low wave energy conditions than unvegetated systems (SMD = 6.261, 95%CIs = 2.10–10.42,n= 15), but performance differences are significantly reduced in higher wave energy conditions (SMD = 6.46, 95%CIs = −2.78–15.69,n= 5). However, due to the small number of observation’s these comparisons must be interpreted with caution. Overall, coastal defence options that entail human interventions (soft, hybrid, and hard measures) perform substantially better in terms of risk reduction than non-vegetated tidal flats, while they perform on-par with natural measures. However, we should point that there is a substantially higher number of pair-wise observations in low wave energy and low-risk conditions (n= 213) than medium-to-high wave energy conditions (n= 49). The results indicate that soft, hybrid, and hard measures are generally much more effective in low-risk contexts than high-risk contexts, when compared to both unvegetated systems and natural measures. For climate change mitigation, soft and hybrid measures in general perform worse than natural measures but much better than unvegetated natural systems. The Cochran’s Q test reveals significant heterogeneity across functions. When compared to paired unvegetated natural systems, measures that contain restored mangrove have the best performance compared to measures containing other restored habitats (e.g. saltmarshes, coral/oyster reefs, other wetlands) (Fig.2a). For individual functions, hybrid measures containing saltmarshes perform the best for wave attenuation (SMD = 7.18, 95%CIs = 1.78–12.59), while soft measures containing mangroves (SMD = 4.06, 95%CIs = 0.72–7.40) and beach and sand dune nourishment (SMD = 2.87, 95%CIs = 0.25–5.49) perform the best for shoreline response. Soft measures containing saltmarshes perform the best for carbon storage (SMD = 14.07) and GHG emissions (SMD = −0.75) compared to measures containing other habitats. For all habitat types hybrid measures slightly outperform their respective soft measures in almost all risk reduction functions (Fig.2a). However, due to the limited number of studies in this subgroup, our analysis should be interpreted with caution. Panela–ecompare functions between soft, hybrid, and hard measures with unvegetated natural systems. Panelf–jcompare functions between soft, hybrid, and hard measures with natural measures. Hedges’ g was used to estimate effect sizes as the difference in the means between the two groups. If the bar falls into the positive side of the plot, we interpreted that soft or hybrid measures provide the given function at a higher level than the reference base (i.e. natural measures). If the bar falls into the negative side it means the opposite. The first numbers in parentheses indicate the number of observations and the second numbers in parentheses indicate the number of studies included in each calculation. Carbon storage and GHG emissions are not available for hard measures and are noted by ‘N/A’. Ranges indicated with ‘#’ denote functions with small number of observations that require cautious interpretation and generalization. Due to lack of data availability, it is impossible to directly compare the performance across soft, hybrid, and hard measures with the above approach. However, we compared them indirectly by examining the performance of soft, hybrid, and hard measures with unvegetated natural systems, using the results of the meta-analysis (see Methods). By using “unvegetated natural systems” as the third comparative base, hybrid measures perform on aggregate slightly better than soft measures (SMD = 0.26, 95%CIs = −0.04–0.57) and hard measures (SMD = 0.18, 95%CIs = −0.23–0.59), although there are no major differences between “soft vs unvegetated natural systems”, “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems”, and “hard vs. unvegetated natural systems” for risk reduction, climate change mitigation, and overall adaptation performance (Fig.1g–h). SMDs for “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems” and “soft vs unvegetated natural systems” are mostly positive for risk reduction functions and negative for climate change mitigation functions, indicating that hybrid measures may perform slightly better for risk reduction but slightly worse for climate change mitigation than soft measures. When comparing “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems” to “hard vs. unvegetated natural systems”, hard measures may perform better for elevation change (SMD = −1.51, 95%CIs = −2.65 to −0.38) and overall shoreline response (SMD = −1.01, 95%CIs = −1.65 to −0.38). At high wave energy level, hard measures are significantly more effective in wave attenuation (SMD = −11.41, 95%CIs = −18.21 to −4.60). However, the overall risk reduction is slightly higher (although not much different) for hybrid measures compared to hard measures. A series of tests, namely sensitivity analysis using Cook’s distance for outliers, regression analysis for temporal change, and publication bias analysis using the Egger test and funnel plots suggest that the results of the meta-analysis are largely robust, with some minor exceptions (see Supplementary Box1and Supplementary Fig. 5-7, Supplementary Material). We calculated Benefit-Cost Ratios (BCRs) for 96 coastal defence projects that contain information on both total costs and total benefits. Specifically, this includes 55 observations of soft measures, 19 observations of hybrid measures, and 24 observations of hard measures. The costs of coastal defence measures vary significantly between different types of measures and different habitats. Overall, for all discount rates (−2%, 4.5%, and 8%), soft, hybrid, and hard measures show considerable economic returns on investment over a 20-year period (Fig.3). The mean BCR was highest for soft measures (mean BCRs for discount rate of −2%, 4%, 8% are 11.08, 6.40, and 4.80, respectively), followed by hybrid measures (mean BCR: 7.18, 4.20, and 3.17 respectively), hard measures (mean BCR: 6.14, 4.11, and 3.40, respectively). Panelaillustrates BCRs of soft, hybrid, and hard coastal defence projects at discount rates of −2%, 4.5%, and 8%. Panelbshows BCRs for different subgroups including mangrove, marsh, seagrass, coral reef, unspecified wetland, beach, and sand dune at the discount rate −2%. Plot boxes show the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum value. Outliers are removed in the boxes. When considering habitat types, soft and hybrid measures with restored mangroves offer the highest returns on investment for all discount rates (mean BCR: 22.02, 12.90, and 9.71, respectively) (Fig.3), followed by seagrasses (mean BCR: 9.28, 5.40, and 4.09 respectively) and salt marshes and other wetlands (mean BCR: 6.20, 3.70, and 2.10 respectively). For restored coral reefs we observe the greatest benefits in terms of natural capital but also low BCRs due to the substantially higher restoration costs (mean BCR: 3.22, 1.3, and 0.93 respectively). Soft and hybrid measures have mean BCRs >1 for all types of habitats and for all discount rates, with the exception of coral reef at 8% discount rate (mean BCR = 0.93). For the soft and hard engineering measures, beach and sand dune nourishments, in general, have lower initial investment costs compared to other hard structures such as groynes, dikes, revetments, breakwaters, and seawalls. However, over a 20-year period, the BCRs suggest relatively similar return on investment between sand nourishment (mean BCR: 2.93, 2.00, and 1.63 respectively) to other hard structures such as dikes and breakwaters (mean BCR: 2.72, 1.90, and 1.50, respectively). Figure4summarises the main patterns for natural, soft, hybrid, and hard measures for coastal defence. Soft, hybrid, and hard measures perform substantially better than unvegetated natural systems in terms of risk reduction and climate change mitigation functions. Performance varies between options in terms of magnitude and direction. According to Fig.1d–f, compared to unvegetated tidal flats, soft, hybrid, and hard measures much better: (a) attenuate wave energy/height through friction and change in water depth16,24, (b) reduce coastal erosion/flooding10,13,25, (c) accumulate sediment17,26, and (d) stabilise shorelines17,25,27. This is consistent with previous studies22,25. Our results also suggest that all soft, hybrid, and hard measures perform effectively risk reduction functions at low-energy or low risk conditions, but their performances decline in high-energy and high-risk conditions. In addition, soft and hybrid measures using restored coastal habitats perform much better for carbon storage, but also have substantially higher GHG emissions compared to unvegetated natural systems. Overall, the restored coastal habitats used in most reviewed NbS tend to be carbon sinks14,26, therefore contributing to climate change mitigation.

Each arrow visually represents all observations elicited from the literature for a given comparison and function, and analysed in Fig.1. The numbers in parentheses indicate the number of observations. The upward and downward direction of the arrow denote respectively higher and lower performance of the coastal defence option on the left of ‘vs.’ compared to the option on the right of ‘vs.’ Colours denote the range of effect size.

The above colours indicate that the respective 95% CIs do not intersect with zero. The white colour indicates there is no major difference between the two respective coastal defence options (i.e. the respective 95% CIs intersect with zero). The cross bar indicates no applicable data. Arrows indicated with ‘#’ denote aggregate functions with a small number of observations that require cautious interpretation and generalisation.

Conversely, soft, hybrid, and hard measures perform similarly to natural measures for risk reduction and overall adaptation outcomes, but worse for climate change mitigation. The latter is influenced by ecosystem stand age28, meaning that restored and newly developed coastal habitats may require substantial time before performing at the same level for such functions compared to mature natural habitats (i.e. natural measures)29,30. Soft and hybrid measures that contain some engineered component tend to cause initial seaward shift and leverage ecogeomorphic feedbacks between vegetation, sediment accumulation, and organic matter accretion, therefore immediately performing better for shoreline stabilisation than natural measures31,32. Most studies report positive shoreline responses within relatively short periods (0–3 years) post-implementation32,33,34, but the elevation and accretion differences between restored and natural habitats largely disappear given enough sediment supply over time32,33,34. Among defence options entailing human interventions, hybrid measures have a slightly better performance for most functions than soft and hard measures, although the differences are not always substantial. Hard and hybrid measures containing grey infrastructure components perform slightly better for wave attenuation and shoreline maintenance than soft and natural measures, but there is substantial variation in risk reduction outcomes for hard measures. For elevation change, the SMD of “hard vs. unvegetated natural systems” varies greatly (95%CIs = -8.1079 to 29.7024, reflecting that hard structures such as dikes and breakwaters are in most cases immediately effective against coastal erosion35,36, but sometimes cause erosion rather than accretion in the long-term due to the complex dynamics with natural coastal processes37,38. Conversely, soft and hybrid measures perform better (and have lower variability in performance) for maintaining shorelines: 95%CIs = 1.0522–6.3425 for soft measures; 95%CIs = 0.3284–0.7536 for hybrid measures. The incorporation of green components (e.g. wetlands) into coastal defence options can essentially create “living shorelines” via the hydrological reconnection of natural habitats to the sea and sediment deposition39,40that could protect coasts as much as hard measures, but with lower environmental risks. We must note that the climate change mitigation function is not applicable to the analysis of the hard measures due to the lack of literature reporting pairwise comparison of GHG emissions between hard measures and other measures. This does not imply that hard structures have zero GHG impacts, as hard coastal defence projects emit significant amounts of GHGs in every phase spanning material extraction, transport, construction, maintenance, and disposal (see Supplementary Box2, Supplementary Materials). On the other hand, soft and hybrid measures that contain ecosystem components tend to sequester carbon, with the mitigation benefits likely to increase during the project timeline as these ecosystem components mature. It was impossible to compare directly the performance of soft, hybrid, and hard measures due to the lack of studies testing their performance in the same locations under the same environmental conditions. We identified only four papers comparing these options under controlled conditions41,42,43,44, which were crosschecked with the indirect comparison, providing similar observations. This lack of studies reporting paired experiments between hard, soft and hybrid measures is a significant gap in the literature. As environmental conditions affect the performance of coastal defence measures, until there are more studies directly comparing these options, it is not possible to confidently conclude which measure performs the best. Similarly, 106 out of the 108 reviewed studies report paired experiments for risk reduction functions during periods not characterised by extreme weather events/conditions (e.g. tropical cyclones, storm surges) and non-climatic events (e.g. tsunamis). Three papers conducted paired experiments during tropical cyclones, reporting that hybrid options such as rock sills with living shorelines performed better than traditional hard measures and natural marshes (North Carolina, Hurricane Matthew)43, while natural habitats behind the breakwaters also recovered faster than reference natural mangrove without the breakwaters (Florida, Hurricane Irma)45, and marshes (with or without sills) perform better for erosion reduction than bulkheads during Category 1 hurricanes44. However, these site experiments were not directly located exactly at the landfall point (local conditions were at Category 1 and 3) and still can be considered not high-risk contexts. More importantly, our subgroup analysis contains a much larger set of pairwise observations in low-energy conditions (213 observations) compared to medium-to-high energy conditions (49 observations). We also notice a context-specific variation in the baseline risk level across different coastal defence measures. In particular, for soft and hybrid measures related to marine ecosystems (i.e. mangroves, marshes), site experiments mostly report relatively lower incident wave energies and wave heights (i.e. <0.4 m). Conversely, site experiments for coastal defence measures such as beaches, sand dunes and hard infrastructure often report higher energy profile conditions ( > 0.4 m). Nevertheless, despite differences in the baseline risk levels between different defence measures, the scientific literature seems to be skewed towards experimental setups in low-energy conditions. When looking critically the above we can infer that the current peer-reviewed evidence is relatively sufficient to draw conclusions on the performance of different coastal defence options for low-risk and low-energy contexts rather than high-risk contexts where effective coastal defence options are extremely critical for the safety of local communities and economic activities. The key point here is that all types of coastal defences have yet to be adequately tested through paired experiments in circumstances of extreme events and high level of risk urgency. This lack of literature is another significant knowledge gap requiring urgent attention. Until there are many more robust paired experiments in high-energy conditions and/or during extreme weather events or geophysical events like tsunamis, we emphasise the danger of any universal assumptions about the performance of coastal defence options, whether natural, soft or hybrid measures. Finally, we should point that due to the characteristics of the underlying literature this review may be possibly biased towards the assessment of soft and hybrid measures (NbS) in the scientific literature for reasons that are beyond the control of the authors. Although hard structures are by far the most prominent coastal defence measures to date, there are fewer assessments of the performance of these structures using paired experiments in the scientific literature: 103 observations of hard measures vs. 772 observations of soft and hybrid measures in our reviewed papers. To reduce to the extent possible this bias, we conducted an additional analysis of the performance of hard structures in the grey literature and report the results in Supplementary Box2(see Methods). The results show that for wave attenuation functions, the effect sizes are higher in the grey literature (SMD = 19.52, 95%CIs = 6.16–33.44,n= 26) compared to peer-reviewed/conference papers (SMD = 6.28, 95%CIs = 2.78–9.80,n= 9). Despite these differences in the magnitude of effect sizes, the pool effect sizes have the same direction of the sign (positive sign, 95%CIs do not intersect with zero). This shows that although the effect sizes are lower in the peer-reviewed literature, they reflect similar phenomena to what has been reported in the grey literature. Nevertheless, we strongly encourage the readers to interpret our findings keeping in mind with the probable bias towards NbS due to the overwhelming focus of paired experiments on these measures compared to hard measures. All coastal defence measures entailing human interventions (soft, hybrid, hard measures) have positive economic returns on investment over a 20-year period (Fig.3), pointing to the strong economic case for investments in such options. Despite the large variation in BCRs between different types of defence measures and ecosystem types due to the equally large variation in reported project costs and benefits, in general, soft measures are comparatively the most cost-effective, followed by hybrid and hard measures. When considering coastal habitats, NbS containing mangroves and saltmarshes have the highest BCRs (Fig.3), as well as the best performance for wave attenuation, shoreline stabilisation and carbon storage (Fig.2). Such cost-benefit estimations are supported by several studies18,22,46,47. Additionally, most of the underlying studies have not considered important benefits such as cultural ecosystem services and other intangible benefits18, which would make the benefit calculations increase for soft and hybrid measures. Thus, the BCRs for NbS here may underestimate the total welfare contribution of such coastal defence options. Furthermore, the project lifetime of hard infrastructure could be >30 years6,48, but here we used for the BCR comparisons a 20-year period, as it is a standard practice for ecosystem-related projects following TEEB guidelines. Thus, the BCRs for hard and hybrid measures could also underestimate some of the economic return of these coastal defence options. Additionally, although natural measures are not included in the cost-benefit analysis, they tend to be more cost-effective than other coastal defence options, as the costs of ecosystem protection are generally lower than restoration costs, while the benefits are generally higher. For instance, previous reviews of mangrove ecosystem service valuation studies indicate higher economic benefits from natural over restored mangroves22,49. Such comprehensive economic lenses should be considered alongside the dimensions of risk reduction and climate change mitigation, when establishing the economic case for choosing the most appropriate coastal defence option in a given context. However, in contexts where natural measures have been destroyed or degraded, soft or hybrid options are the next best options. Table1−2 summarises the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) of these four coastal defence options. We find that all natural, soft, hybrid, and hard measures provide risk reduction functions and have high cost-effectiveness. Although hybrid measures perform slightly better than natural, soft, and hard measures in reducing risk, this is not significantly different in statistical terms (Fig.1). Thus, the choice of coastal defence option arguably depends on the types of risks, their intensity, and the urgency for protection. Previous studies have pointed that NbS (hybrid, soft, natural measures) require substantial establishment periods, which makes them suitable only in contexts characterised by low-to-medium risk urgency7. For example, restored mangroves require 5-10 years50and restored saltmarshes around 6 years51to reach maturity, and thus provide the full extent of their risk reduction and climate change mitigation functions. When risk intensity is high, maintaining natural ecosystems might become burdensome, given the time requirements of natural recovery processes. At the same time, the growth of coastal habitats depends largely on the prevailing environmental conditions. These suggest that planting new habitats via soft measures may not always be appropriate in high-risk zones or in areas that cannot ecologically support these habitats. By contrast, hard measures can be built within a relatively short timeframe and have immediate effects, particularly in contexts characterised by high risks and/or extreme conditions, where other options are not feasible7,11. Our results indicate that hybrid options can harness the strengths and overcome some of the limitations of natural, soft and hard measures. These findings are also in line with the previous global studies7,52. Arguably, hybrid measures can be suitable in contexts characterised by medium-to-high risk and high urgency7. For example, in some hybrid options, hard components such as dikes and breakwaters can provide immediate protection for an eroding coast, while the establishment of natural or restored saltmarshes can deliver long-term shoreline stabilisation with lower environmental damage53. Current technological and engineering advances can broaden considerably the possible range of hybrid options and improve their feasibility and suitability. Overall, our analysis suggests that natural and soft measures work well in low-risk contexts, while hybrid and hard measures are better options for medium-to-high risk contexts. While it might have been previously enough to consider risk reduction, cost-effectiveness and risk urgency when selecting coastal defence options, the current reality of accelerated climate change complicates further such decisions presently. A recent technical report during the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC-COP27) positions nature-based solutions with their climate mitigation functions perceived as “core” benefits, instead of “co-” or “additional” benefits54. Our results confirm that NbS (either hybrid, soft or natural measures) with natural and restored coastal habitats are significant carbon sinks and very effective in mitigating climate change (Fig.1). Thus, we argue that the ability to provide climate change mitigation functions should become an integral criterion for selecting appropriate coastal defence options. The findings have major implications for policy and practice, particularly in view of the UNFCCC-COP26, which noted the centrality of nature-based solutions for achieving the Paris Agreement. Interpreting our results at an aggregated level, there is a clear case for investing in NbS for coastal defence and climate change adaptation considering their substantial benefits for risk reduction and climate change mitigation, as well as their cost-effectiveness. Hybrid measures could theoretically reduce the weaknesses of natural, soft and hard measures, thus holding high potential for innovation and application to various contexts. However, it is crucial to generate appropriate knowledge and guidance in designing and planning NbS that fit the application contexts, particularly when considering the multiple knowledge gaps and factors affecting their effectiveness. Pragmatically, hard measures are inevitably necessary for coastal defence in high-risk contexts, especially in the short-to-medium term before gaps are filled and novel and context-relevant approaches to NbS development and implementation are developed. Additionally, the wide-scale implementation of hybrid and soft measures for coastal defence is still challenging and not without critique. Despite the many successful trials reviewed here, there have also been negative or mixed outcomes. Lessons learned include to avoid introducing exotic species in vulnerable coastal systems on reclaimed land to prevent environmental trade-offs55or to ensure that degraded land restoration does not affect communal agricultural/grazing land or exacerbate pressure on surrounding areas56. Notably, while most soft and hybrid measures restoring existing habitats could be effective and have low environmental risks, NbS that create entirely new ecosystems are exercises in uncertainty7. Unlike hard measures, the effectiveness of NbS via soft, hybrid and natural measures is largely determined by the capacity of local communities and their long-standing ways of engaging with nature57. Arguably for highly exposed and vulnerable communities that have limited financial resources and high levels of environmental inequity, there is a higher risk of ineffectiveness of such measures (or even a waste of financial resources or maladaptation)58. We identified a bias in the literature towards information from the Global North and lower risk areas. About 68% of the identified and analysed cases were in Europe, North America, and Australia, in regions facing low-to-medium risks, where coastal communities are relatively less vulnerable. Bearing in mind this critical knowledge gap and imperfect information, we point out the risk of perceiving NbS as a “silver bullet” for coastal adaptation and “normalise” their application in the Global South, particularly in contexts characterised by high risks, vulnerability, and poverty. Considering this context-specificity, the decision-making process should be guided by the specific policy goals, priorities, local capacity, and socioecological constraints. However, while the implementation constraints of hard engineering structures are largely attributable to technological limits, those of soft, hybrid and natural measures tend to be socio-cultural and institutional (Table2). In this sense, knowledge asymmetry can be critical to the upscaling of NbS for coastal defence. Practitioners on the ground do not normally obtain both the ecological and technical knowledge for the effective design of the ecosystem-based and hard engineering components respectively7. Furthermore, they are not always engaged in the distinct social interactions across project phases59. Arguably the design and implementation of NbS for coastal defence and adaptation would require an interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary mindset, which would be rather distinct to that of the design and implementation of hard measures. It might be increasingly necessary to empower the people on the ground, equip them with broader integrated knowledge of ecology and engineering, promote public acceptance, and prepare for societal shifts for effective participation and collaboration in coastal NbS design, implementation, and management. This paper conducts a meta-analysis of the academic literature to systematically assess the performance of different types of coastal defence options to climate change-related hazards. We focus on hard, hybrid, soft, and natural measures, which depending on their type they can be located inside the sea or between communities and low tides, and provide protection against diverse climate-related natural hazards. Within the scope of this paper, hard engineering measures (called hard measures hereafter) are defined as the coastal defence options that utilise structures such as seawalls, dikes, breakwaters, and levees6. Soft measures are defined as coastal defence options that utilise the natural environment to reduce coastal risks. Soft measures include (a) coastal defence options that rely on restored, rehabilitated, reforested, planted, protected, and/or managed natural habitats such as mangroves, salt marshes, coral reefs, seagrass and kelp beds or (b) coastal defence options that utilise natural systems such as beach and sand dune nourishment, dredging, and beach scraping7. Hybrid measures are defined as the coastal defence options that utilise a combination of hard engineering structures and soft measures, e.g. breakwaters in front of salt marshes or rock sills with oyster reefs11. In this category we also include environmentally-friendly engineering solutions such as vegetated grey structures. Natural measures are defined as the coastal defence options that rely on undisturbed, naturally regenerated, or degraded natural habitats10. Hybrid, soft, and natural measures fall under the umbrella term of Nature-based solutions (NbS). For comparative purposes we also consider unvegetated natural systems such as unvegetated sand flats, mud flats, open beaches, bare lands, or abandoned aquaculture ponds. Supplementary Table3provides more detailed definitions. Among these five types, the hard, hybrid, and soft measures entail active human interventions for coastal defence. Natural measures and unvegetated natural systems with (or without) autonomous or evolutionary natural adaptation to climate change, were used as comparative bases for our meta-analysis (i.e. controls). However, we need to point out that unvegetated tidal areas can serve very different functions compared to vegetated tidal areas (e.g. open beaches for tourism). Although they may not perform well for risk reduction functions as other defence measures, they are nevertheless important landscape features. Our systematic review compares the performance of these coastal defence measures across three dimensions: (a) risk reduction, (b) climate change mitigation, and (c) cost-effectiveness. Risk reduction refers to the ability of a coastal defence measure to reduce the intensity, frequency, or severity of losses from climate change-induced coastal disasters such as sea level rises, floods, typhoons, and erosion3. The risk reduction functions that fall within the scope of this review include wave attenuation (i.e. wave height reduction, wave energy reduction at low and high wave energy conditions) and shoreline response (i.e. accretion, erosion, elevation change, sedimentation accumulation). Climate change mitigation refers to the ability of the coastal defence measure to store carbon and reduce GHG emissions. Cost-effectiveness refers to the analysis of the monetary costs and benefits of the defence measires, and provides an economic lens for understanding the investment needs and the potential returns, valued in monetary terms. The study dimensions and functions were selected based on the following criteria: (a) the dimension/function is crucial, justifiable, and appropriate in the context of coastal defence options and the types of risks being analysed; (b) the dimension/function is suitable for all five types of coastal defence options and can be assessed through consistent and established methods; (c) the techniques used to assess each dimension/function should be comparable among the comparison groups; and (d) the available information and data can enable the comparison of performance between the groups, and should be sufficient to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the meta-data analysis. The studied functions do not represent all possible risk reduction or mitigation functions the study coastal defence options. Nevertheless, the selected functions can offer a sound assessment that reflects well the currently available evidence in the academic literature. We systematically searched the academic literature to identify quantitative studies that compared the effectiveness of different coastal defence options on different functions. We used three categories of keywords that reflected: (a) the coastal defence options (including NbS and hard engineering solutions); (b) the coastal contexts; and (c) the comparison functions (including wave attenuation, shoreline response, carbon storage, GHG emissions, and economic costs and benefits). The detailed keywords are provided in Supplementary Table4, and were selected to include a comprehensive set of coastal defence measures in both peer-reviewed and non-reviewed studies (see below). We applied the PRISMA principles to ensure the quality of the systematic review and meta-data analysis60. After downloading and removing the duplicates, we applied two filters for screening. First, the first author scanned the titles and abstracts to remove the non-relevant papers. Next, the remaining papers were read in full by the first author to determine whether they met the pre-defined selection criteria below: Studies had to be peer-reviewed or high-quality grey literature that reports empirical field data or laboratory experiments. No temporal limits were included; For the meta-data analysis: studies that examined a given function in a controlled or paired experiment between and within the two groups: i.e. (i) options entailing human interventions (i.e. soft, hybrid, and hard measures) and (ii) natural systems (i.e. natural measures and unvegetated natural systems). For inclusion, the studies must report sample size, mean, and standard variation for both controlled and paired groups on wave attenuation capacity, shoreline stabilisation, carbon storage, and GHG emissions; For the cost-benefit analysis: studies that reported the monetary values with standard and established evaluation methods; Studies had to report active human intervention to coastal defence and adaptation to climate change or natural disaster risk reduction. Coastal interventions that were not associated with climate change or did not entail human intervention were excluded. Studies had to include current or recent empirical observations. Historic or prehistoric observations were excluded. The literature review covered studies published in the English language up to July 2023 (search date 22 July 2023), without restriction on publication date. We identified peer-reviewed literature in Elsevier Scopus and ISI Web of Science Core Collection using the article’s title, abstract, and keywords to identify the relevant literature. We identified grey literature in the BASE database. To ensure the high quality of the meta-analysis, we only included conference proceedings and doctoral dissertations from non peer-reviewed literature that met our critical appraisal criteria (see next section). Data from consultancy reports, governmental reports, and reports to funders were also extracted and analysed, but due to their generally lower performance in the quality appraisal, we report this data in the supplementary material and not the main paper. This way it is possible to provide additional information of whether the effect sizes differ between the peer-reviewed and non peer-reviewed literature. Overall, a total of 300 peer-reviewed studies and 4 non peer-reviewed studies were included in the main analysis and 9 non peer-reviewed studies were included in the Supplementary Materials. Supplementary Material Fig.1reports in detail the literature selection and screening process, and the number of excluded studies at each stage. Supplementary Data1includes the list of the included studies’ title, authors, and related information. It is critical to assess and evaluate the reliability of evidence at the level of the individual study to ensure the quality of the meta-analysis61. Here, we followed appraisal guidelines for ecosystem services and conservation studies and developed a checklist for internal validity including research aims and objectives, data collection, data analysis, results and conclusions, and design-specific aspects61(Supplementary Table2, Supplementary material). Each study was then assessed against the checklist and categorised as having very strong evidence (score: >75%), strong evidence (score: 50-74%), moderate evidence (score: 25-48%), and weak evidence (score: <25%). Overall, the critical quality appraisal indicated that 96% of the peer-reviewed studies have very strong evidence, 3% strong evidence, and only three studies had moderate and weak evidence. The average quality score across all peer-reviewed studies was 85.9%. To ensure the high quality of the meta-data analysis, we only included peer and non peer-reviewed studies with very strong and strong evidence. Thus, we removed the 3 studies with moderate and weak evidence. The final database for data coding and extraction includes 304 studies. The critical appraisal of all reviewed studies can be found in the Supplementary Data2. The meta-data analysis was conducted for comparisons of coastal defence options that entail human interventions (i.e. soft, hybrid, and hard measures) with two comparative bases (natural measures and unvegetated natural systems). This results in a total of six types of paired comparisons, namely: (a) soft vs. natural, (b) hybrid vs. natural, (c) hard vs. natural, (d) soft vs. unvegetated natural systems, (e) hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems, and (f) hard vs. unvegetated natural systems. As outlined in the research approach, we conducted the comparisons across two dimensions: (a) risk reduction (wave attenuation, shoreline stabilisation) and (b) climate change mitigation (carbon storage, GHG emissions). We only extracted observations that were paired both at the same site and in the same study. The extracted variables for each function are explained below. For the wave attenuation function, we assessed three response variables, namely wave height reduction, wave energy reduction, and wave transmission coefficient. These variables are functionally related. The typical method used for estimating these variables in the field is to measure the incoming wave energy or wave height at wave recording stations along a shore transect encompassing a paired experiment between adaptation and non-adaptation16,24. Considering the large variation in the baseline level of risk across different studies, we extracted information about the morphodynamic characteristics in each study. Data on significant wave height, wave energy, and storm conditions are used as indicators to classify the contextual condition of all pair-wise observations into high wave energy and low wave energy profiles. Wave attenuation analysis was then conducted for comparing the performance of soft, hybrid, and hard measures in low wave energy and high wave energy contexts. A significant wave height of <1 m is used as the cut-off point for a low wave energy conditions62and >1 m for high wave energy conditions. Acknowledging the lack of commonly-agreed definitions and indicators of low/high wave energy conditions in the current literature and the inherent limitations of using wave height/wave energy as an indicator, this methodological decision does not aim to provide a standardised metric of wave energy profile beyond the context of this study. For the shoreline stabilisation function, we assessed three response variables, namely accretion change rate, elevation change rate and sedimentation accumulation. We included vertical accretion rate and soil surface elevation data which were measured in the underlying studies through surface elevation tables and the feldspar-marker horizons technique63. Sedimentation and deposition were measured in the underlying studies using sediment traps, Petri dishes and filter papers64. When accretion, elevation, and sedimentation accumulation rates were measured for multiple time frames, we calculated the average annual rate across the experiment period. For the carbon storage function, we assessed the capacity of the coastal defence option to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and accumulate it in biomass and the soil carbon pool14. We extracted multiple response variables that represent carbon uptake such as aboveground biomass, foliage pool, belowground biomass, fine root pool, stump pool, soil carbon uptake, gross primary production, and carbon sequestration rate. The carbon storage function was not available for hard measures. For GHG emissions, we assessed the levels of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from the soil, belowground biomass, and soil-emergent plant structures65. Coastal natural habitats have formed a dense carbon pool, which means that they are potential GHG emission hotspots when degraded14. Along with the carbon storage functions of EbAs, it is also important to consider GHG emissions to identify possible trade-offs. For hard measures, GHG emissions could come from their construction, maintenance and operation.66However, following literature screening we could not find any studies reporting a paired experiment on the GHG emissions from hard/hybrid/soft engineering measures and restored/natural measures. Hence, this function was not available for comparisons containing soft engineering, hybrid and hard measures. For each reviewed paper included in the meta-data analysis, we extracted the sample size, mean, and standard variation for both controlled and paired groups on the abovementioned functions (see Supplementary Data3–9). Data were taken from the main text, tables, and figures. We used WebPlotDigitizer (available athttps://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) to graphically extract data from plots and figures. We also extracted data on general coastal defence characteristics including geographical location, longitude, latitude, implementation scale, actors, coastal defence types, implementation stage, ecosystem types, adaptation period, species name and species age, tidal range, and related environmental factors. In total, we identified 108 studies on risk reduction and 75 studies on climate change mitigation, reporting 492 observations of comparisons between study groups We used standardised mean difference (SMD) Hedges’ g to calculate for each function the effect size of coastal defence options that entailed human intervention and the reference natural system within the same study. The effect size is a statistical parameter used in meta-data analysis to compare the results of different studies that measure a common effect of interest, with adjustments for differences in scale among studies23. Hedges’ g has been the most common measure of effect size in ecological meta-data analyses to estimate the effect as the difference in the means between two groups23. Hedges’ g includes a correction factor for small sample size and is not affected by unequal sampling variance between paired groups67. We inverted the sign of SMD for the GHG emissions, wave height, wave energy, and wave transmission coefficient before combining them with other response variables to estimate the overall effect size, as the lower means of these variables are correlated with better functions. To estimate the overall effect and each type of function across all studies, we used multivariate models which account for non-independence within individual studies. As there are often multiple response variables measured in individual studies (e.g. wave height reduction while calculating accretion rate and sediment accumulation in the same study), non-independence within individual studies is ubiquitous68. Thus it is not appropriate to use conventional models such as fixed-effect models and random-effect models, which assume independence between observed outcomes from studies23. We illustrated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the effect sizes in forest plots. When the 95% CIs did not intersect with zero in the forest plots, we interpreted that coastal defence options entailing human intervention (soft, hybrid, or hard measures) has a clear positive or negative effect on a given function compared to the reference base (natural unvegetated system or natural measures). If the bar fell into the positive side of the forest plot, we interpreted that the coastal defence option entailing human intervention provides the given function at a higher level than the reference base. We interpreted the opposite if the bar fell into the negative side. We do not use P-value or CIs as a conventional description of “statistical significance”, as their misuse has been criticised in many studies69,70. Thus, in this study, 95% CIs denote the range of probable effect size with 95% confidence71. We avoid using the term “significant” when interpreting the results, and instead when the 95% CIs bar does not intersect with zero we interpret that the coastal defence provides the given function at a clear-cut higher or lower level than the reference system. Cochran’s Q statistic (Qt) was used to identify whether there is heterogeneity in the effect sizes across studies23. When the P-value is less than 0.05 for the Qt, there is variation among effect sizes by sampling error alone. We conducted subgroup analysis for ecosystem types to identify possible factors causing heterogeneity across studies. Effect sizes were calculated and compared for different ecosystem type (e.g. mangrove, salt marsh, coral reef, seagrass bed, unspecified wetland, and beach and sand dune) for different functions. Due to data limitations, it was not possible to conduct the type of meta-data analysis outlined above comparing directly soft, hybrid, and hard measures. Due to the very limited number of studies reporting paired experiments between these coastal defence options within the same studies and sites, the extracted data was insufficient to conduct a proper meta-analysis. Hence, we opted for an indirect analysis, comparing the performance of “soft vs unvegetated natural systems”, “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems”, and “hard vs. unvegetated natural systems” from the result of the meta-data analysis outlined above. Using “unvegetated natural systems” as a reference third comparative base, we estimated the difference in the performances of soft, hybrid, and hard measures on a given functions compared to the reference base as a proxy for indirect comparison between them. We calculated SMD based on sample size (number of reviewed studies), mean (estimated SMD from the previous meta-data analysis), and standard deviation between two paired groups: vs. “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems” vs. “soft vs unvegetated natural systems” and “hybrid vs. unvegetated natural systems” vs. “hard vs. unvegetated natural systems”. We used fixed-effects models to estimate the overall effect and the effects for each type of function. Forest plots were used to illustrate 95% CIs for the effect sizes, which were interpreted as explained above. This indirect comparison is arguably appropriate to some extent considering that all effect sizes from the different studies were calculated adjusting for differences in scales in the previous meta-data analysis. The extracted data on the direct comparisons between these coastal defence options (i.e. paired data from the same studies and at the same sites) were also used for simple descriptive analysis provided in the discussion, and were crosschecked with the results of the indirect analysis. To evaluate the robustness and reliability of the meta-data analysis, we conducted a series of tests to: (a) identify the effects of outliers and influential observations on the outcomes, (b) test the changes in the magnitude and direction of research findings over time; and (c) detect possible publication biases in the reviewed studies. First, for the sensitivity analysis we used Cook’s distance to identify outliers in the dataset that were worth checking for validity72. Possible outliers are indicated when a Cook’s D for that data point is more than 4/n, where n is the number of observations for the given functions73. After identifying the outliers, we excluded them and recalculated the pool effect sizes. We compared the previous results with the results that excluded the outliers to examine whether the outliers had a significant effect on the results. Second, changes in the magnitude of the directions of the effect sizes over time have been repeatedly reported in ecological studies, which may jeopardise the stability of the conclusions drawn from the meta-analysis23. Such changes in the direction can be due to factors such as extreme influence of a high impact study on later research, tendency to prove a higher effect size than previous research, and selectively publishing results that outperform previous results23. To detect whether the temporal trends present in effect sizes, we conducted meta-regressions to examine the relationship between effect sizes and publication years. Third, the possibility of publication biases was tested using funnel plots and Egger’s regression74. Publication bias is defined as “whenever the dissemination of research is such that the effect sizes included in a meta-analysis generate different conclusions than those obtained if effect sizes for all the appropriate statistical tests that have been correctly conducted were included in the analysis”23. We followed the guidelines for testing publication biases proposed for biological meta-analysis75using the “metafor” package in R version 4.2.2, which is appropriate for small sample size bias corrected Hedges’ g76. After conducting these tests, we critically evaluated the reliability and robustness of the results of the meta-data analysis. Rather than treating individual studies as discoveries of wider global truth, meta-data analysis synthesises the empirical information in the academic landscape. Throughout the text, we noted which results to interpret with careful consideration and the possible biases posed by the quality of the reviewed studies, and reflected further on these issues by suggesting directions for future empirical studies in the discussion. We conducted a meta cost-benefit analysis for soft, hybrid, and hard coastal defence projects globally. We elicited costs and benefits from the peer-reviewed literature for 96 coastal defence projects, including 55 observations for soft measures, 19 observations for hybrid measures, and 24 observations for hard measures. Some studies reported the total economic costs and benefits in the same sites for the same project, while others only included individual categories of costs and benefits subject to the thematic focus of each study. To ensure the consistency and comprehensiveness of the cost-benefit analysis (and avoid double counting), we used only the total economic costs and total economic benefits in our BCR calculations. Among the 96 projects, 50 projects reported pair-wise information on the total costs and total benefits in the same sites within the same projects, while 46 projects (all soft and hybrid projects) only reported the costs. For the missing information of the total benefits of these 46 projects, we used the value transfer approach to pair benefit values with the cost values. For this value transfer exercise we find the best match of the benefits through the Ecosystem Service Value Database (ESVD), developed by The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) Foundation77. This database includes 9500 observations of monetary benefits of ecosystem services of restoration projects from over 1100 publications over various case study locations. We followed the standard value transfer approach78,79, where the benefit was identified in the ESVD database that best matches each coastal restoration project site in terms of geographical and social similarities, based on 4 criteria: (a) similarity in non-market commodity, (b) similarity in the affected population, (c) similarity in property rights, and (d) similarity in ecosystem types and coastal defence measures. The benefits then were paired with the costs of the projects for the BCR calculations. All economic costs and benefits were standardised and converted to 2021 USD values. To do so, first, we converted the monetary values reported in each individual study to the official local currency for the study year using the official exchange rates. We then used the official gross domestic product (GDP) deflator to adjust these values to the local currency values for the year 2021. Finally, all values were standardised to 2021 USD values, using the purchase power parity (PPP) conversion factors. The official exchange rates, GDP deflators, and PPP conversion factors were extracted from the World Bank’s database80. The economic costs of coastal defence projects were calculated as 2021 USD ha-1for soft and hybrid measures, and 2021 USD m.m-1shoreline for hard measures. From the first year following the implementation of the adaptation measures, we accounted for annual operating or project maintenance costs. These costs amounted to 2.5% of the original financial capital costs for all adaptation options and for all habitats, with the exception of coral reefs that are self-sustaining following restoration (i.e. maintenance cost of 0%)18. The economic benefits of coastal defence projects were converted to 2021 USD ha-1yr-1for soft and hybrid measures, and to 2021 USD m.m-1shoreline yr-1for hard measures. We calculated the total benefit of coastal defence options for a period of 20 years at social discount rates of −2%, 4.5%, and 8%18. The negative rate −2% reflects the scenario that ecological degradation and resource depletion will deteriorate the future conditions, thus resulting in a greater value of any additional wealth18. The rate 8% reflects a scenario of slowing economic development and rising energy prices, thus overestimating the risk-adjusted opportunity costs18. The net present economic benefit was calculated by summing the average annual values of the total economic benefits provided by the individual coastal defence options. For soft and hybrid options (excluding beach and sand dune nourishment), the benefits were calculated from the fifth year following the initial development to allow enough time for the restored/planted mangroves, saltmarshes, and wetlands to reach a certain level of maturity to provide benefits18. For beach nourishment and hard measures, benefits were calculated from the first year following the initial development. The benefit-cost ratios were then calculated for 20 years using Eq.1: where PV is the present value; t is the year of calculation (t = 1 when calculating benefits for soft engineering and hard measures and t = 5 for soft and hybrid EbAs); B is the total economic benefits; C is the total economic costs; and r is the discount rate. We calculated BCR for each of the 96 coastal defence projects spanning soft, hybrid, hard measures for three discount rates −2%, 4.5%, and 8%. To ensure the robustness of the results, we excluded from the analysis the outliers (e.g. projects with abnormally high costs or benefits). For transparency, these outliers are highlighted in the database in Supplementary Data10. Cost-benefit analysis has only been conducted for coastal defence options that entail human interventions (i.e. hard, hybrid, soft measures) and not for natural measures or unvegetated natural systems, given the lack of data for the investment costs of these options. We synthesised the findings of the systematic review using the Strengths – Weaknesses – Opportunities – Threats (SWOT) approach. The Strengths and Weaknesses refer to the internal characteristics of the defence options themselves for coastal adaptation (e.g. performance), while the Opportunities and Threats refer to the wider system characteristics that support or hinder the design and implementation of each defence option for coastal adaptation (e.g. institutional/technological/funding circumstances)81. For each coastal defence option, we derive statements for each SWOT element from (a) results of the meta-analysis, (b) qualitative/quantitative findings or discussion points reported in individual studies, or (c) our critical understanding of the broader literature. The entire synthesis approach relies on our expert judgement and the source of each SWOT statement is indicated accordingly. First, this study relies on the academic literature specifically peer-reviewed papers and published conference papers. Data from grey literature that did not meet quality criteria was extracted but analysed in the Supplementary Box2. We consciously decided to omit the grey literature from the main analysis to ensure the reproducibility, reliability and quality of the meta-analysis. Thus, while our meta-analysis can indicate the current scientific evidence of the effectiveness of different coastal defence options, it should not be considered as the totality of the evidence. Second, although our review used a broad range of possible keywords related to coastal defences, these terms were confined to reflect climate change adaptation and natural disaster risk reduction. It was not possible to include all keywords related to coastal adaptation, defences and protection against natural disasters. The reviewed papers were published in English, but studies on coastal defences may also be published in other languages such as Portuguese, French, or Mandarin, among many others. Although we believe that the search process has allowed for a very good identification of the relevant international literature on this topic, keyword selection and language restriction may introduce biases in geographical representation, and possibly the direction and magnitude of mean effect sizes. Third, findings for some individual and aggregate functions are based on small numbers of observations (n< 3) due to the general lack of literature on specific topics. For the benefits of the reader, these functions are indicated in asterisks in the respective figures. We strongly encourage the cautious interpretation and generalisation of findings for these comparisons. To ensure the robustness of the results, we re-calculated all relevant aggregate functions omitting individual functions with few observations (n< 3) (see Supplementary Table8, Supplementary Materials). The differences in effect sizes before and after removing the functions with few observations are rather minor in terms of the direction of effect sizes, the magnitudes, and their 95% CIs. We therefore are confident that the results are robust. Fourth, we are aware of the presence of publication biases in the reviewed studies. The Funnel plot and Egger’s test are popular methods for detecting publication biases23. However, none of the currently available methods has the desirable statistical capacity to deal with extreme heterogeneity in true effect sizes82. Both the funnel plot and Egger’s test have inherent limitations83. Although we detected publication biases in some areas of our analysis, we did not conduct further investigations to ascribe values to potentially ‘missing’ studies. As publication biases are unavoidable in scientific research, we strongly encourage the cautious interpretation and generalisation of our findings.

A new study shows that combining them with nature-based solutions could, in some contexts, create defenses which are better able to adapt. Researchers reviewed 304 academic articles on the performance of coastal defenses around the world, including: natural environments; soft measures (which support or enrich nature); hard measures (such as concrete sea walls); and hybrids of the aforementioned. Soft and hybrid measures turned out to be more cost-effective than hard measures, and hybrid measures provided the highest hazard reduction overall in low-risk areas. Although their comparative performance during extreme events that pose a high risk is not clear due to lack of data, these results still support the careful inclusion of nature-based solutions to help protect, support and enrich coastal communities.
Japan’s dramatic natural coastline, with iconic views of Mount Fuji, wind-blown pines and rocky beaches, has been captured and admired in paintings and prints for hundreds of years. But take a walk by the ocean nowadays and it can be hard to find a stretch that retains its pristine natural seascape. By the early 1990s, a government survey found that around 40% of the coast had been altered with concrete sea walls, filled harbors, stacks of tetrapods and more, adding swaths of gray to the blue-green landscape. Sprawling coastal cities and towns have grown to house most of the population, so protecting homes and businesses from the dangers of tsunamis, typhoon swells and sea-level rise has become an ever-increasing challenge.
“Sea walls, dikes, dams and breakwaters, the so-called traditional hard measures, despite being the most popular coastal defenses globally and with proven track records, are facing challenges to keep pace with increasing climate risks,” explained Lam Thi Mai Huynh, a doctoral student from the graduate program in sustainability science at the University of Tokyo and lead author of a new study on coastal defenses. “These hard structures are expensive to build and require continuous upgrades and repairs as sea level rises and climatic hazards become stronger. Although they are good at mitigating certain coastal disaster risks, they can also cause significant disruption to coastal communities and have adverse environmental effects. Furthermore, they often significantly alter the seascape and sometimes alienate local communities from nature and the very environment we seek to protect.”
To better understand the performance and benefits of different hard and nature-based coastal defenses, an international team compared the results of 304 academic studies. Nature-based coastal defenses included: “natural” ecosystems, for example, existing mangroves and coral reefs; “soft” measures, which restore, rehabilitate, reforest or nourish natural ecosystems; and “hybrid” measures that combine both nature-based components and hard structures, such as placing concrete breakwaters in front of mangroves.
“By incorporating such natural components, we can create coastal defenses that reduce risk and also offer substantial environmental benefits. We believe that such strategies are very promising in many parts of the world, but they are also not a ‘fix-all’ solution,” said Professor Alexandros Gasparatos from the Institute for Future Initiatives at the University of Tokyo.
The researchers analyzed three key aspects of each type of defense: 1. risk reduction (how much the measure could reduce wave height and energy, and influence shoreline change); 2. climate change mitigation (including carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions for nature-based measures); and 3. cost-effectiveness over a 20-year period.
“Our results indicate that among all coastal defense options in lower-risk areas, hybrid measures provide the highest risk reduction. Hybrid measures can harness the advantages of both hard and soft measures. They provide the immediacy of an engineered barrier while largely maintaining the ecological functionality of a permeable vegetated zone,” said Huynh. “All nature-based solutions are found to be effective in storing carbon, while both soft and hybrid measures are relatively more cost-effective than traditional hard measures over a 20-year period, though all have positive economic returns.”
These findings provide strong evidence for integrating and upscaling nature-based components into coastal defenses, but the team advised doing so with caution. “All types of coastal defenses have yet to be adequately tested through paired experiments in circumstances of extreme events and high-risk urgency,” warned Gasparatos. “Until there are many more such experiments focusing on this, we must caution against any universal assumptions about the comparative performance of coastal defense options, whether natural, soft or hybrid measures.”
While acknowledging the limits imposed by the lack of available research on extreme and high-risk situations, Huynh and Gasparatos still believe that this study supports the idea of investing in nature-based solutions for coastal defense in lower-risk areas. Research like this has important implications for policymakers, coastal planners and communities looking to make evidence-based decisions.
“I firmly believe that we must think more carefully about the design and function of these barriers in this era of ever-accelerating climate change,” said Huynh. “Not only can nature-based solutions contribute to risk reduction and climate mitigation in many areas, but they can also help reconnect people with nature and support biodiversity. Greening our coastlines can create spaces which enhance quality of life, foster community well-being and inspire environmental stewardship.”

Anti-vaccine conspiracies fuel divisive political discourse,"You have full access to thisopen accessarticle 64kAccesses 1411Altmetric 13Mentions Explore all metrics Anti-vaccine attitudes pose a threat to public health by impeding the development of herd immunity. However, the proliferation and politicization of anti-vaccine discourse, exacerbated by the pandemic and the rise of social media, have not been fully elucidated. This study, using Japanese Twitter data, revealed that (a) anti-vaxxers are characterized by high political interest, (b) persistent anti-vaxxers were more ideologically left-leaning and had stronger ties to existing political parties, and (c) pandemic-induced new anti-vaxxers displayed low political engagement but a greater affinity for conspiracy theories, spirituality, naturalism, and alternative health practices, which served as gateways to anti-vaccination views. Furthermore, those who turned anti-vaccine after the pandemic also exhibited an increased tendency to follow the newly emerged anti-vaccine party, potentially contributing to their political representation at the national level. These analyses show that the anti-vaccine discourse has expanded and reached a politically representative scale, strengthening its discursive network with conspiracy theories, spirituality, naturalism, and alternative health practices. Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript. The global spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the challenge posed by anti-vaccine attitudes. Despite scientific evidence that supports the effectiveness of vaccines in reducing the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19 infections, a significant segment of the population remains hesitant about or completely resistant to vaccination. This vocal minority presents a significant obstacle to public health efforts to achieve herd immunity [1,2]. Although anti-vaccine attitudes are not new [3], social media has amplified their scale and velocity, making containment efforts increasingly difficult [4]. The onset of COVID-19 in early 2020 coincided with an era of heightened social media use, further increasing the prevalence and relevance of anti-vaccine narratives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaccine attitudes have become further complicated by their politicization. The most notable example is the relationship between anti-vax beliefs and former US President Donald Trump. Despite boasting about his administration’s support for vaccine development, Trump expressed reluctance to take a booster shot. These mixed messages have resulted in Trump supporters, who often harbor distrust toward government and experts, displaying a tendency to eschew preventive measures like vaccination and mask-wearing, in contrast to liberal citizens. In Europe, anti-vaccine sentiments have been linked to support for populist parties that express skepticism toward elites and experts [5,6]. The intersection of anti-vaccine attitudes with support for specific political parties and their influence on policymaking can have profound implications for public health. Hence, there is an urgent need to elucidate the mechanisms of the spread of anti-vaccine narratives on social media and their political ramifications. Nonetheless, the existing literature suffers from two critical limitations. First, the prevailing research has focused on describing the characteristics of individuals holding anti-vaccine attitudes, utilizing cross-sectional data (e.g., ref. [7]), whereas there is a dearth of research on the mechanisms behind the transformation of individuals into anti-vaxxers (however, see ref. [8]). A static analysis of demographic and psychological features of anti-vaxxers will not reveal the underlying triggers of the development of such attitudes. Second, while the existing literature has demonstrated how established political parties, particularly populist parties, have utilized anti-vaccine sentiments to garner support in the US and Europe, analysis of the political forces that have emerged due to anti-vaccine sentiments is lacking. The proliferation of anti-vaccine attitudes through social media has enabled emerging political forces to attract voters who feel alienated by established parties by making opposition to vaccines a primary agenda. The primary objective of this study is to address the abovementioned gaps in the literature by examining Twitter data from Japan during the pandemic. First, we aim to describe the characteristics of individuals who hold anti-vaccine attitudes on Twitter. We then investigate the triggers of anti-vaccine attitudes by analyzing the social influences they encounter on Twitter. Second, we aim to shed light on the political consequences of anti-vaccine attitudes by examining the emergence of the Sanseito party, which has gained momentum by advocating anti-vaccine policies. Sanseito, formed in March 2020, has attracted individuals who believe in anti-vaccine narratives, conspiracy theories, and spiritual discourses while espousing right-wing, revisionist historical views. Despite being a newcomer, Sanseito won one seat in the July 2020 House of Councillors election with over 2% of the popular vote. We aim to articulate the link between the rise of Sanseito and anti-vaccine attitudes to demonstrate that the anti-vaccine segment of the public can quickly gain a foothold in national politics. Previous studies found that while pro-vaccine sites draw on scientific research and statistical evidence provided by experts, anti-vaccine sites tend to reject scientific knowledge and instead employ postmodern narratives that relativize scientific truth [9,10]. Anti-vaccine websites also promote health behaviors lacking medical evidence, such as alternative medicine and homeopathy [9]. These anti-vaccine discourses have persisted into the COVID-19 pandemic, with the rapid spread of anti-vaccine sentiments through social media having significant political consequences [4]. Anti-vaxxers create insular online communities on Facebook [11] and are more closely connected to those with moderate views on vaccines than to pro-vaccine communities. This facilitates their recruitment of new members [12]. On Twitter, Germani and Biller-Andorno [7] identified pro- and anti-vaccine users by analyzing hashtags. They found that anti-vaccine users are less active in sending messages but more engaged in retweeting and replying to them, particularly to those from a small number of influencers, including Donald Trump. Mitra et al. [8] collected over three million tweets from 2012 to 2016 and categorized users into three groups: those with long-standing pro-vaccination attitudes, those with long-standing anti-vaccination attitudes, and those who had recently adopted anti-vaccination attitudes. Individuals with entrenched anti-vaccination attitudes tend to exhibit high degrees of conspiratorial thinking in relation to the government, including references to the “Deep State.” Conversely, those who developed anti-vaccine attitudes after August 2014 did so in response to the widely publicized “vaccine fraud” incident, without initially holding broad conspiracy beliefs. However, once an anti-vaccine attitude is adopted, it tends to reinforce other conspiratorial beliefs, as individuals who subscribe to one conspiracy theory are more likely to embrace others [13]. Anti-vaccine beliefs are not isolated but rather closely linked to alternative medical practices, conspiracy theories, spiritual discourses, naturalism, and other beliefs [14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Survey data from multiple countries also confirm the association between anti-vaccine attitudes and conspiratorial thinking [21]. These associations suggest that individuals may adopt anti-vaccine beliefs via various gateways, such as health consciousness, conspiracy theories, spirituality, and naturalism. As anti-vaccine attitudes became prevalent on social media, their link with political affiliation grew more prominent. In the United States, conservative Republicans exhibit stronger anti-vaccine attitudes than liberal Democrats [22,23,24] owing to their more prevalent anti-expert sentiment. Among conservatives, support for Donald Trump is associated with particularly strong anti-vaccine attitudes, primarily owing to the prevalence of conspiratorial thinking rather than to political conservatism [25]. Communities coalesce around political leaders who perpetuate conspiratorial thinking and uphold conservative values, shaping the identity of those with anti-vaccine attitudes [26]. Anti-vaccine attitudes in Europe have become politicized and are closely linked to populism, which pits “the people” against “corrupt elites.” Consequently, those who advocate for vaccination from a public health perspective, including governments, politicians, scientists, and experts, are often viewed as “enemies” of the people. As a result, individuals who distrust these groups are more likely to support populist parties [5,6,27]. An analysis of anti-vaccine and political attitudes suggests that populist parties, framing their message as “the people vs. corrupt elites,” exploit antipathy toward experts who advocate for vaccines to co-opt those with anti-vaccine views. However, COVID-19 is unique in that the number of individuals with anti-vaccine attitudes has reached unprecedented levels owing to the vaccine’s availability to all. The significant distrust of and aversion to COVID-19 vaccines has made it easier for new organizations to seek political representation by promoting conspiratorial anti-vaccine campaigns. While Donald Trump and European populist parties were already influential political actors prior to the pandemic, their attempts to expand their power through anti-vaccine sentiment have been well documented. However, few studies have examined the parties that enter national politics during a pandemic to represent anti-vaxxers by exploiting anti-vaccine attitudes as a single issue. This study addresses this gap in the literature. Although not the majority, a significant portion of the Japanese population holds anti-vaccine attitudes [28]. While the vaccination process proceeded smoothly, anti-vaccine beliefs are prevalent in Japan, as seen in the spread of misinformation about the cervical cancer vaccine, which resulted in an anti-vaccine campaign [29]. Indeed, misinformation about vaccines is widespread in Japan. For instance, data from a nonprobability online sample collected in 2022 revealed that 23.5% of people had encountered false information that “COVID-19 vaccines can cause infertility in women” [30]. In April 2022, members of the anti-vaccine conspiracist group Yamato Q were apprehended for trespassing in a clinic where COVID-19 vaccines were being administered and attempting to disrupt the vaccination process. Yamato Q was formed as a Japanese branch of the US-based conspiracy theory QAnon movement, which claims on its website that “COVID-19 does not exist,” “the vaccine contains disease-causing agents,” and “vaccination is part of a plan to reduce the population” [31]. Although only a handful of individuals engage in extremist anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, a substantial number in Japan exhibit anti-vaccine sentiments in more moderate forms. This sentiment was expressed through support for the political party, Sanseito, which was formed in March 2020. Sanseito’s platform incorporates conspiracy theories, spirituality, and naturalism, including anti-global capitalist and anti-Semitic conspiratorial views, and its strong commitment to organic food aligns with its opposition to introducing artificial substances into the body, including vaccines. Sanseito successfully campaigned on these policies by relying heavily on social media, including Twitter and YouTube. Consequently, in the House of Councillors election in July 2022, Sanseito secured one seat less than two years after its inception, granting it a national political voice. We define accounts spreading anti-vaccine information as those that post or retweet ant-vaccine tweets and accounts that disproportionately follow them as anti-vaccine accounts. This definition serves two purposes. First, retweeting a tweet does not necessarily indicate agreement with its content [32,33], making it difficult to infer anti-vaccine attitudes from retweet behavior. However, selective exposure has been observed in the following behavior [34], indicating that information about “friends” (i.e., the accounts followed by focal accounts) can be useful in estimating user attitudes. For example, it has been shown that users’ ideology can be accurately estimated using information about their friend lists (e.g., ref. [35]). We retrieved tweets in Japanese containing “ワクチン” (the Japanese word for vaccine) or “vaccine” using the Twitter Public API between January 1 and December 31, 2021. We refer to these as “vaccine-referencing tweets” (N= 98,805,971). A total of 6,777,598 accounts posted or retweeted vaccine-referencing tweets. Subsequently, we clustered the tweet network to categorize vaccine-referencing tweets. To do this, we adopted the methodology outlined by Uchida et al. [36] by selecting vaccine-referencing tweets that were retweeted at least twice and calculating the Simpson coefficient for all pairs of tweets to measure user overlap. We constructed a tweet network by establishing edges between pairs of tweets with Simpson coefficients surpassing 0.2. Finally, the Louvain method was employed to extract tweet clusters from the network. This clustering method was applied to each of 12 sets of monthly data. Then, in any two clusters among all detected clusters, the pairs were merged in order of the highest overlap rate of retweeters, and merging was stopped when the overlap rate of any pair no longer exceeded 50%. This clustering resulted in 20 tweet clusters with more than two tweets. However, the majority of tweets (more than 99%) were concentrated in the three largest clusters, which also accounted for 98% of the total number of retweets. Consequently, we focused our analysis on these three largest clusters. Upon manual inspection of tweets within the clusters, we observed that the largest cluster contained pro-vaccine tweets, the second largest expressed opposition to the government’s vaccine policy, and the third largest consisted of anti-vaccine tweets. Examples of typical tweets from each cluster are presented in TableS1in the Supplementary Materials. Table1shows the number of original tweets, the total number of retweets, and the number of unique accounts that tweeted or retweeted for each cluster. We labeled the first cluster “pro-vaccine information spreading accounts” (N= 1,382,065), the second cluster as “policy criticism spreading accounts” (N= 248,699), and the third cluster as “anti-vaccine information spreading accounts” (N= 196,936). In this study, anti-vaccine accounts are defined as those that follow a significantly large number of “anti-vaccine information spreading accounts.” The following procedures were used to identify these accounts. First, 50,000 accounts were randomly selected from each of the three clusters in Table1as of December 31, 2021, resulting in a total of 150,000 accounts. Given the high costs associated with collecting extensive network data through API, random sampling was necessary. From these 150,000 accounts, we included only those for which we could obtain friend lists from January 2020 to December 2021 as of March 2022, when the analysis was conducted, to enable longitudinal analyses. The friend list of each account was estimated in January 2020 and December 2021 based on the order of friend additions and the creation date of the friend’s account. For each account, we calculated the proportion of anti-vaccine information-spreading accounts in the friend list. The level of anti-vaccine sentiment, as determined by the percentage of accounts in the friend list that disseminate anti-vaccine information, enabled us to classify account attitudes into three categories. The Low anti-vaccine group was comprised of accounts in the bottom 25% (i.e., percentage < 0.24%) in terms of the proportion of anti-vaccine spreading accounts in the friend list. The Moderate anti-vaccine group included accounts between the bottom 25% and the top 25% (i.e., 0.24% ≤ percentage < 12.3%). The High anti-vaccine group consisted of accounts in the top 25% (i.e., percentage ≥ 12.3%). The initial and final counts of accounts in each group are presented in Table2. Please note that the number of accounts decreased from 150,000 to 115,335 in January 2020 because of the requirement for continuous availability of friend lists from 2020 to December 2021, as of March 2022.　The resulting distribution of the percentage of anti-vaccine information spreading accounts in the friend list is shown in Fig.1for both the start (January 2020) and end (December 2021) of the analysis period. Distribution of the percentage of anti-vaccine information spreading accounts in the friend list Figure1illustrates the proportion of accounts spreading anti-vaccine information within the friend lists of each account at two-time points: January 2020 and December 2021. Each dot in the figure represents an individual account, with the color indicating the level of anti-vaccine attitudes as of December 2021, namely High, Middle, and Low. TheX-axis represents the proportion of accounts as of January 2020, while theY-axis represents the proportion as of December 2021. Since the three categories were determined based on the proportions as of December 2021, theY-axis shows the proportions of High (25%), Middle (50%), and Low (25%) categories. Note that the histograms at the top and right of the graph show that many of the accounts tweeting and retweeting about vaccines did not follow a single anti-vaccine information-spreading account (i.e., 0%). This suggests that while many anti-vaccine tweets were spread during the pandemic, many of them circulated among a small number of people with anti-vaccine attitudes. In January 2020, the High anti-vaccine group represented 11.8% of the sample. By December 2021, this percentage had increased to 25%, indicating a rise in anti-vaccine attitudes. Table3displays the changes in affiliation categories from January 2020 to December 2021, among 115,335 accounts for which data were available at both time points. None of the accounts moved from the High group to the Low group, but 1921 accounts moved from the Low group to the High group. In addition, 6466 accounts transitioned from the Moderate group to the High group, while only 1,030 accounts moved from the Moderate group to the Low group. Overall, more accounts strengthened their anti-vaccine stances than weakened them during the pandemic. First, we compared the characteristics of the High and Low groups as of December 2021 to illustrate the characteristics of anti-vaxxers. Subsequently, we partitioned the High group into two subgroups: those who continuously belonged to the High group from January 2020, and those who had shifted from the Low group to the High group by December 2021. We analyzed the differences between these groups to identify the characteristics of users who develop new anti-vaccine attitudes. Finally, we compared the following rates of political party accounts from March to September 2022 to demonstrate that the meteoric rise of the anti-vaccine party, Sanseito, in the Upper House election is associated with an increased tendency of those who moved from the Low group to the High group to follow Sanseito’s account, rather than those who had always been in the High group. To begin, we analyzed the descriptive characteristics of anti-vaccine users. We compared the Low and High groups as of December 31, 2021, to identify the characteristics of those with strong anti-vaccine attitudes. To accomplish this, we trained a classifier that uses two features—following anti-vaccine influencers during the early days of Twitter use and profile language features—to distinguish between the High and Low groups. We extracted features that significantly contributed to this classification, enabling us to characterize each group. The first feature we considered was the proportion of anti-vaccine influencers followed during the earliest days of Twitter use. We calculated the percentage of anti-vaccine influencers among the friend list during five distinct time slots: 1st–10th, 11th–20th, 21st–30th, 31st–40th, and 41st–50th, based on the order of followership in the friend list. For this analysis, anti-vaccine influencers were defined as accounts that spread anti-vaccine information and had over 10,000 followers, with posts that were retweeted more than 1000 times. The second feature is profile language, which consists of nouns, verbs, and adjectives used in the Twitter profile texts as of March 2022. Table4shows the top 20 predictive features for classification, sorted based on their weights, using linear support vector machine for the binary classification of the High and Low groups (see Fig.S1in the Supplementary Materials for the rationale behind adopting the linear support vector machine). As shown, there are characteristic features and their corresponding weights that are predictive of classification into either the High or the Low group. Table4shows that features that measure the following anti-vaccine influencers in the early phases of Twitter use come at the top of the list of the characteristic features of the High group. That is, those who follow anti-vaccine influencers soon after starting to use Twitter were more likely to maintain anti-vaccine attitudes until December 2021. These features arguably represent two effects. One is that those who first started using Twitter with the aim of gathering anti-vaccine information tend to be consistently anti-vaccine. The other is that by following anti-vaccine influencers for whatever reason in the early stages of use, they are persuaded by the influencers to hold persistent anti-vaccine attitudes. The High group is also distinguished by features related to politics, including terms such as “politics,” “Japan,” “Japan Communist Party,” “nuclear power plant,” and “democracy.” This heightened interest in politics aligns with prior research indicating that the global pandemic has politicized anti-vaccine attitudes [6,25,37]. In contrast, the most prevalent features for classification into the Low group pertain to cultural artifacts like games and anime, encompassing terms such as “adult” (mature content), daily life, TRPGs (table talk role-playing games), andUma Musume(name of a game). No political keywords are present. Although these accounts also mention vaccines through posts or retweets, they exhibit a predominantly personal interest in games and anime, indicating that Twitter serves as a platform for their hobbies. Individuals using Twitter for personal hobbies are less likely to hold anti-vaccine attitudes. Next, based on Table3, we classified individuals who were in the High group in January 2020 and retained this classification in December 2021 (N= 12,999) as the HH group. Similarly, we designated individuals who were in the Low group in January 2020 but shifted to the High group in December 2021 (N= 1921) as the LH group. Our objective was to outline the attributes of those who switched to an anti-vaccine stance after the pandemic onset. We constructed a network comprising 14,920 accounts (comprising both HH and LH groups) as nodes, with their follow/follower relationships serving as edges. Subsequently, we utilized the Louvain method to identify 12 clusters within the network. Regarding the profile texts of all accounts within each cluster as its documents, we then retrieved the words with high TF–IDF (term frequency–inversed document frequency) scores as its feature words. Specifically, words with a frequency of occurrence less than 10 times across the entire corpus are omitted, and words that appear in 80% or more of the documents across the entire corpus are excluded. See Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Materials for sensitivity analyses on these two parameters. Because the four largest clusters accounted for 91.3% of all accounts, we manually labeled each cluster based on its respective feature words (Table5). The upper row for each cluster in Table5lists the feature words using profile texts from January 2020, while the lower row lists those from March 2022. However, the substantive conclusion remains consistent regardless of which row is interpreted. The largest clusters, which represent 43.1% of the HH and LH groups, are characterized by feature words related to conspiracy theories, health concerns, spiritual discourse, and naturalist discourse. For example, “group stalking” refers to surveillance and harassment by an unspecified number of people, while those who claim victimization are characterized by paranoia and conspiracy theories such as “electromagnetic wave attacks” and “thought eavesdropping.” “Technology” is often used in profile texts to mean “technology crime,” which refers to organized crime that exploits harassment, electromagnetic waves, and ultrasound, and is also part of conspiracist discourse. This cluster also exhibits a high level of health consciousness, as indicated by terms such as “health,” “immunity,” and “diet.” Similarly, “fabric softeners” are strongly believed by some health-conscious naturalists to cause chemical sensitivity, including headaches, nausea, and dizziness owing to their scent. Furthermore, Haruma Miura is the actor who committed suicide during the pandemic, and conspiracy theorists believe that the truth of his death was covered up. “Wave” and “Universe” are keywords often mentioned in spiritual discourse. Therefore, the first cluster can be interpreted as a health-conscious cluster with a preference for conspiracy theories, spiritual discourse, and naturalist orientation. It is also noteworthy that no political discourse appears in this cluster. The second cluster exhibits strong leftist characteristics, as profile texts frequently mention the leftist party Reiwa and its leader Taro Yamamoto, expressing criticism and condemnation of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his administration, as well as hostility toward rightist parties such as Ishin. The third cluster demonstrates a high level of interest in issues typically supported by leftist parties, such as opposition to nuclear power plants, concern over radiation contamination in Fukushima, anti-war sentiment, the Okinawa US military base issue, and support for the Japanese Communist Party. While the second cluster references political parties and leaders, the third cluster focuses more on issues that align with leftist ideology. The fourth cluster, in contrast, expresses hostility toward “anti-Japanese” forces, conservatism, the emperor, the Japanese flag, and rightist politicians, reflecting a rightist cluster with conservative ideology. How do cluster membership patterns differ between the HH and LH groups? Table5indicates that the LH group is overwhelmingly represented in the first cluster at 82.7% and in the leftist cluster at 10%. This suggests that the new anti-vaxxers who emerged after the pandemic have a strong inclination toward conspiracy theories, spirituality, and naturalism. In contrast, the HH group, which held anti-vaccine views before the pandemic, has the largest membership in the conspiracy theory/spiritual/naturalist cluster at 37.8%, with 31.3% in the leftist cluster and 11.3% in the leftist issue cluster. This suggests a clear leftist political ideology in the HH group, with a minor rightist inclination at 8.5%. Thus, the HH group’s political stance is clearer than that of the LH group, but it also displays a significant inclination toward conspiracy theory and spiritual/naturalist discourses. Finally, we investigate the potential link between major political parties or their leaders and anti-vaccine attitudes at two-time points: March 2022, when the anti-vaccine party Sanseito was established, and September 2022, following the House of Councillors election. Specifically, we examine whether the prevalence of anti-vaccine attitudes on Twitter contributed to Sanseito’s success. To this end, we examine the extent to which accounts following the official Twitter accounts of major political parties or their leaders were included in the HH and LH groups, respectively, as an indication of association with a particular political party. The proportions of anti-vaccine accounts (i.e., the HH and LH groups) that follow these official accounts are presented in Fig.2. Associations between major political parties/leaders and anti-vaccine accounts Figure2demonstrates that the HH group, persistently opposed to vaccinations, exhibited a greater inclination to support leftist parties such as the Constitutional Democratic Party, Reiwa, and the Japanese Communist Party during the pandemic. This observation aligns with the findings presented in Table5, which indicate that the HH group had more profile texts associated with leftist parties and their agendas. Additionally, the following pattern of the HH group remained relatively consistent, with a slight upsurge in their support for Sanseito from March to September 2022. In contrast, the LH group, who developed anti-vaccine sentiments following the pandemic, displayed a weaker tendency to follow prominent political figures and major parties. Nevertheless, the LH group demonstrated an exception in their support for Sanseito, with 13% of members already following Sanseito or its leader in March 2022, which rose to 24% by September. This increase surpassed that of the HH group. Sanseito made anti-vaccine discourse a central part of its election campaign. This campaign was partially successful in gaining the support of the existing anti-vaccine voters (the HH group), but it was more successful in quickly gaining the support of new anti-vaccine accounts (the LH group) whose anti-vaccine attitudes were triggered by health and side-effect concerns, spiritual discourse, and conspiracy theories in the wake of the pandemic. Persistent anti-vaxxers, owing to their established affiliations with established liberal and—to a lesser extent—conservative parties, exhibited a limited propensity to transition to the nascent Sanseito movement. Conversely, individuals with minimal political involvement and weak ties to established parties prior to the pandemic but a preexisting interest in health, spirituality, and conspiracy theories are likely to have been receptive to Sanseito’s electioneering efforts. The global COVID-19 pandemic and the widespread push for vaccination have hastened the spread of anti-vaccine sentiments, which the extensive use of social media has facilitated. Although previous research has shed light on the characteristics of those who oppose vaccines, few studies have explored the factors that lead people to adopt such views. Therefore, this study employs a longitudinal analysis of anti-vaccine discourse on Japanese Twitter to examine the drivers of the transformation into anti-vaccine advocates. Moreover, we examine the emergence of the anti-vaccine party in the context of the politicization of anti-vaccination and elucidate the process by which anti-vaccine advocates gain political representation. The analysis shows that anti-vaxxers are more politically involved than other Twitter users interested in vaccines. They include both rightists and leftists, but leftists are dominant. Anti-vaxxers’ strong interest in politics contrasts with non-anti-vaxxers, who, while tweeting/retweeting about vaccines, are primarily concerned with the realm of private interests, such as gaming and anime. A comparison of users who were consistently anti-vaccine before the pandemic with those who turned anti-vaccine afterwards indicates that the former followed anti-vaccine influencers in the early stages of their Twitter use, suggesting they originally had an interest in vaccines and a social influence on Twitter. They were also more politically interested than new anti-vaxxers, leaning more to the left than to the right. In contrast, new anti-vaxxers are less politically engaged but have a particular interest in health, spiritual and naturalist discourses, and conspiracy theories. The study suggests that the emergence of new anti-vaxxers was not primarily driven by political concerns. Rather, their preexisting interests in conspiracy theories, spiritual discourse, and health acted as a gateway to their adoption of anti-vaccine attitudes during the pandemic. Owing to the high congruence between anti-vaccine sentiment and conspiracy theories and alternative health practices [14,15,16,17,18,19,20], these individuals incorporated their anti-vaccine beliefs into their original belief systems, resulting in their identification as anti-vaxxers. While persistent anti-vaxxers tended to follow established left-leaning political parties and leaders, such as the Constitutional Democratic Party, Reiwa, and the Japanese Communist Party, new anti-vaxxers rarely followed existing political parties. However, the number of new anti-vaxxers following the anti-vaccine Sanseito increased sharply from March to September 2022, suggesting that Sanseito has successfully appealed to those who became anti-vaccine during the pandemic, resulting in its seat in the Diet. To summarize, our findings suggest that individuals without anti-vaccine beliefs can be exposed to anti-vaccine tweets if they possess a strong focus on health or spirituality and are driven by pandemic-related anxiety. As a result, they may be inclined to support a political party that combines anti-vaccine mixed conspiracy theories with spiritual discourses. For instance, Yumi Akao, the unsuccessful co-chair of the Sanseito Party in the Upper House election, has expressed her intention to establish politics that aligns with the “era of the wind,” a term of significance in spiritual discourse. Sanseito’s representative, Sohei Kamiya, likewise referenced this term in a speech, stating that “it appears that we are currently in the ‘era of the wind.’” Additionally, the party often invokes conspiracy theories regarding international Jewish capital, which attracts individuals who subscribe to such beliefs. By weaving these spiritual and conspiratorial narratives together with explicit or implicit anti-vaccine rhetoric, Sanseito rapidly gained the support of those who became vaccine-hesitant during the pandemic. This study has several limitations that remain to be addressed. First, since this study focuses solely on the case of Japan, it is unclear which aspects of the findings are specific to Japan and which can be generalized globally. Similar findings to this study, which suggest that spirituality serves as a gateway to anti-vaccine attitudes, have been reported in the Czech Republic [38] and the United Kingdom [39]. Therefore, the relationship between spirituality and anti-vaccine attitudes may have generalizability beyond Japan. On the other hand, whether anti-vaxxers are politically represented heavily depends on the influence of supply-side factors, which can vary significantly from country to country. While Japan witnessed the emergence of an anti-vaccine Sanseito during the pandemic, countries where such parties did not emerge would likely see anti-vaccine individuals supporting existing right-wing or populist parties. Thus, it is believed that there are significant factors specific to Japan when it comes to the political representation of anti-vaccine individuals. Second, we defined those who disproportionately follow accounts spreading anti-vaccine information as “anti-vaxxers.” Still, there is room for debate regarding the assumption that the act of following represents users’ attitudes. For instance, if 30% of the friend list consists of accounts spreading anti-vaccine information, according to our study’s definition, they would be identified as the “High group.” However, simultaneously, 40% of the friend list may consist of accounts spreading pro-vaccine information. In cases where users follow both types of accounts spreading anti- and pro-vaccine information, their follow behavior may reflect information-seeking strategies rather than their attitudes. However, it should be noted that there were not many accounts that followed both accounts spreading anti-vaccine information and accounts spreading pro-vaccine information (see Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Materials). Future research is called for to refine the estimation of anti-vaccine attitudes. Finally, this study demonstrated that individuals who became anti-vaccine after the onset of pandemic exhibited a higher increase in following rates of Sanseito compared to those who were already anti-vaccine prior to the pandemic. However, a causal relationship with voting in elections has not been established. While following behavior on Twitter is associated with support for political parties, obtaining evidence that individuals who became anti-vaccine after the pandemic were strongly mobilized to vote for Sanseito requires future analysis that combines Twitter data with survey data on voting behavior. When individuals adopt anti-vaccine discourses, they develop a belief system that aligns with other spiritual discourses and conspiracy theories, making them resistant to persuasion. Therefore, preventing the adoption of anti-vaccine beliefs is crucial in reducing the overall number of anti-vaxxers. This requires investigating how anti-vaccine discourses intersect with non-scientific health practices, alternative medicine, spiritual discourse, and conspiracy theories, as these serve as gateways to anti-vaccine beliefs. Failure to do so increases the risk to public health policies, allowing political parties that prioritize opposition to vaccines as their signature issue to gain entry into the national political arena. Upon request, we can provide the complete IDs of the tweets used in the analysis, as long as they comply with the terms and conditions of Twitter (currently X). However, we are unable to disclose user IDs or information regarding the followers of the individuals analyzed, as it violates Twitter’s terms and conditions. This limitation exists to prevent the identification of individuals’ attitudes towards vaccines. Carey, J. M., et al. (2022).

Of particular significance were conspiracy theories surrounding the virus and vaccines made to combat it. Though conspiracy theories about vaccines are not a new phenomenon, this was the first time they were observed becoming elevated to the level of national political discourse. A new study led by researchers from the University of Tokyo shows that online political engagement, conspiracy theories and spirituality played crucial roles in shaping the anti-vaccine beliefs of different groups.
The pandemic was a world-changing event that will likely be studied from many different perspectives for a long time to come. Researchers around the world explore the impacts it had on people, institutions, health, and even the environment. Professor Fujio Toriumi from the Department of Systems Innovation studies how public opinion forms by analyzing communications data such as news media or social networking. His group examined the phenomena of anti-vaccination conspiracy theories, focusing on Japanese Twitter records, and drew some conclusions about the impacts and causes of such beliefs.
“During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a rise in anti-vaccine sentiments on social media, and our study aimed to understand the triggers that led individuals to adopt anti-vaccine attitudes,” said Toriumi. “We found anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists, so-called anti-vaxxers, exhibited stronger political engagement compared to vaccine supporters. Although some Japanese users express right-wing tendencies, a majority lean toward more left-wing ideologies, in contrast to what was observed in the West.”
Long-term anti-vaxxers showed strong political engagement, often aligning with liberal parties; however, those brought into the fold of anti-vaxxers due to the pandemic exhibited weaker political interest overall, but there were strong and frequent occurrences of terms related to conspiracy theories and spirituality in their Twitter profile descriptions. While the study doesn't establish causation, it highlights the potential role of conspiracy theories and spirituality as gateways leading individuals to support more divisive politicians and political parties.
“Spirituality, naturalism, alternative health practices and anti-vaccine sentiments all have something in common: their indifference or even disdain for scientific evidence,” said Toriumi. “Individuals interested in these topics tend to pick what scientific facts suit their opinions. Also, they exhibit strong resistance to the incorporation of artificial substances into their bodies under the guise of naturalism. It is believed that these similarities serve as gateways to anti-vaccine conspiracy theories.”
It might be tempting to think that the views and opinions of fringe groups online don’t have any real-world consequences, but there have been some high-profile cases of conspiracy theories breaking the confines of the online realm; for example, in the U.S., the so-called Capitol insurrection and far-right conspiracy group QAnon’s obstruction of vaccine efforts, and in Japan, the rise of controversial political party Sanseito, which is built on a variety of conspiracy theories and anti-immigration rhetoric, amongst other things, but also environmentalism. And while the spread and impact of conspiracy theories is a global issue, there are some instances that are particular to Japan.
“The uniqueness of conspiracy theorists leaning left in Japan may be attributed to the impact of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster,” said Toriumi. “While anti-nuclear sentiments have long been associated with leftist ideologies, the addition of the fear stemming from radioactive contamination has led to the proliferation of conspiracy theories predominantly within the leftist spectrum, believed to be related to fear surrounding the incorporation of foreign substances into the human body. This might have heightened fear, hesitancy and mistrust in vaccines during the pandemic and was likely reinforced by increased representation online.”
All over the world, not just in Japan, social media is considered a major vector for spreading misinformation. The prominent factors for this include the rapid dissemination of information and the wide scope of its reach, as well as the influence of the echo chamber, the nature of social media platforms to present users with things that likely support — and reinforce — their biases. These unique characteristics of social media make it more susceptible to the spread of misinformation compared to traditional media, which are more likely to have editorial oversight or even legal regulation regarding content, and which social media usually lacks. Social media platforms also contain a vast sea of data, which make them far more difficult to observe and analyze.
“The most challenging aspect of conducting this research was applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to vast feeds of Twitter data that were constantly changing,” said Toriumi. “This was done to classify patterns of people's attitude changes toward the COVID-19 vaccine, distinguishing between persistent anti-vaxxers and pandemic-induced new anti-vaxxers. In the future, we intend to explore the effectiveness of different communication strategies in addressing vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Additionally, we plan to investigate the role of social media platforms and their algorithms in amplifying or mitigating the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing effective interventions to promote public health and combat misinformation.”

The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated1,2,3,4,5,6,7. However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1–EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2–compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations,TET2mutation or elevatedDNMT3Aexpression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies. H3K27me3 is a cancer hallmark that accumulates around the promoter regions of genes that should be properly expressed. Consequently, the chromatin structure becomes condensed and the genes essential for cell identity and appropriate functions are suppressed1. Excessive H3K27me3 is among the principal epigenetic drivers in cancers2,3. The H3K27me3 enzymes EZH1 and EZH2 are compensatory factors that enable stable regulation of methylation patterns8,9,10. EZH2 is a histone modifier that is frequently detected to be abnormal in cancers and alters the entire epigenome by increasing H3K27me3 levels. Targeting EZH2 provides a therapeutic benefit in B cell lymphomas and certain solid tumours with vulnerabilities4,5. Valemetostat is a first-in-class EZH1–EZH2 (EZH1/2) dual inhibitor that can block the complementary effects of EZH1/2 (refs.10,11). It is expected to be more efficient than EZH2-selective inhibitors in eliminating H3K27me3 and is highly effective against lymphomas. Clinical trials of valemetostat have shown its sustained safety and efficacy against HTLV-1-associated aggressive adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL) and other lymphomas6,7. Next-generation epigenetic therapies targeting H3K27me3 are promising and rapidly developing, and clinical trials are being conducted for various cancer types. However, it remains unclear how the systemic H3K27me3-based therapies affect the tumour epigenome in patients to elicit the clinical efficacy. Moreover, clinical recurrences after a long period have also been observed in the trials; however, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. We conducted timelapse analyses of the patients enrolled for the valemetostat clinical trials. ATL, a rare type of T cell lymphoma with poor prognosis12,13particularly renowned for its increased H3K27me3 levels14,15, was selected as the target for the first-in-human clinical trial of valemetostat6. In total, ten participants among the enrolled patients in two clinical trials (patients 1–3 (Pt1–3) from phase I as the discovery cohort and Pt4–10 from phase II as the validation cohort) were subjected to intensive molecular monitoring. Valemetostat was administered orally once daily (200 mg daily) until a sign of disease progression could be observed (Supplementary Table1). The patient responses to the therapy and tumour dynamics were observed after administration of valemetostat. In all cases, lesions were detected in the peripheral blood, allowing us to collect and analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to directly assess the clinical efficacy and tumour characteristics using less-invasive tests. We applied the HTLV-1 provirus integrated within the tumour genome to improve tumour cell identification accuracy. The number of abnormal lymphocytes drastically decreased after 1 week of treatment (Fig.1a). In parallel, we also observed a significant reduction in soluble IL-2 receptor-α (sIL-2Rα) and HTLV-1-infected cell counts, denoted as proviral load (Extended Data Fig.1a,b). Pt1 showed a partial response. Pt2 and Pt3 showed complete response at 20 and 12 weeks, respectively. All patients were able to stay on single-agent valemetostat for more than 2 years with acceptable safety and durable response. Likewise, rapid responses were observed and clinically diagnosed as partial response or complete response in the validation cohort (n= 7) (Extended Data Fig.1c,d). a, Changes in abnormal lymphocytes of three cases in a first-in-human valemetostat phase I study.

ORF, open reading frame.g, Treatment-associated changes of H3K27me3 (xaxis) and H3K27ac (yaxis) at ChIP–seq-merged all peaks. Statistics and reproducibility are described in the Methods. Source Data All PBMC samples (n= 104) were collected from the patients immediately before (Pre) and during treatment, as well as during the progressive disease stage (Supplementary Table1). Whole-genome sequencing of the Pre-samples revealed a significant number of somatic mutations as single-base mutations (3.9 mutations per megabyte per sample on average) or copy number variations typical to ATL16(Supplementary Tables2and3). Pt3 was characterized as a poor prognostic type harbouring a homozygousTP53mutation andPDL1(also known asCD274) structural variation17. Targeted deep sequencing revealed that the variant allele frequency of the major clones decreased in parallel with decreasing abnormal lymphocytes and proviral load dynamics (Fig.1b). We further used HTLV-1 provirus frequency to quantify the size of multiple clones18. Major clones and unexpanded subclones were significantly depleted by valemetostat with similar dynamics (Extended Data Fig.1e,f). Targeted genome profiling showed that the mutation pattern of the responders was similar to that of the general cohort16. Malignant clones with poor prognostic variations, includingPRKCB,TP53,IRF4andPDL1(ref.19), were diminished after treatment (Extended Data Fig.1gand Supplementary Table4). We used a flow cytometry-based H3K27me3 assay20to quantify the methylation changes in the ATL cells. The observed tumour H3K27me3 level was generally high in the Pre-samples, but the valemetostat treatment reduced it to a normal level (Extended Data Fig.2a–c). Rapid reduction of H3K27me3 levels was observed in the tested patients (n= 9), and a statistical correlation between H3K27me3 loss and clinical benefit was observed (Fig.1cand Extended Data Fig.2d,e). We next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) to further assess how valemetostat affects the tumour epigenome. Clinical specimens from Pt1, Pt5 and Pt8 were available, and tumour cells before treatment and at clinical response were sorting-enriched (more than 95%) and analysed for tumour-specific H3K27me3. The pre-treatment tumour cells showed an overall increasing trend in H3K27me3 compared with normal T cells (Extended Data Fig.2f–h). The H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) pattern inversely correlated with H3K27me3. In particular, the H3K27me3-mediated super-silencer cluster21was observed spanning over 1 Mb around several regions. H3K27me3 profiling before the treatment showed that H3K27me3 clusters averaging more than 10 kb (0.199–288 kb) in length were established mainly around the transcription start site (TSS). Valemetostat treatment significantly reduced H3K27me3 levels in tumour suppressor genes (TSGs), showing a genome-wide reduction of H3K27me3 peaks (more than 35,000 peaks) in all cases (Fig.1d,e). Focusing on the gene loci, an overall decrease was observed around the TSS and across the gene body (Fig.1f,g). Moreover, H3K27ac levels increased in the regions where H3K27me3 levels were reduced. Both EZH1 and EZH2 targets were alleviated similarly (Extended Data Fig.2i,j). Tumour-specific bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) confirmed that typical target genes10were restored immediately after the treatment (Extended Data Fig.2k–m). These results indicate that valemetostat sufficiently restored the epigenome of the tumour cells close to the healthy state, leading to clinical improvements. We performed single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq) to evaluate the influence of valemetostat on the chromatin structure and gene regulation. We collected live PBMC samples (totaln= 10 from phase I) at Pre, at the time of clinical response (partial response or complete response) and at progressive disease and sequenced 85,480 cells (Fig.2a). In general, an average of 86,351 peaks per sample could be detected. These peaks included those at the promoter regions of the marker genes in the ATL cells (for example,CADM1), confirming that those cells were indeed ATL cells. The HTLV-1 provirus reads were also useful in detecting minimal residual disease, thus allowing the identification and analysis of even those tumour cells that were reduced to less than 5% as a result of the treatment (Extended Data Fig.3a,b). Provirus and host genome chimeric reads18gave helpful information for identifying the clonal origin of the cells. a, The workflow illustrates the collection and processing of fresh peripheral blood samples from a clinical trial and the following multilayered experimental platform. ChIP–seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing.

Statistical significance is provided only for main combinations. The middle line within the box plots corresponds to the median; the lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles; the upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR); and the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 times the IQR.h, Aggregate scATAC tracks and H3K27me3 distribution before and after valemetostat treatment at the representative H3K27me3 target loci (miR-31andBCL2L11) in three patients. Highlighted regions show chromatin decondensation by valemetostat. Statistics and reproducibility are described in the Methods. Source Data Compared with normal CD4+T cells, the propagated tumour cells before the treatment showed an aggregated chromatin structure across the entire genomic regions in all cases (an average of 39.4% of the detected ATAC peaks,P< 0.05) (Fig.2b,cand Extended Data Fig.3c). Referring to the ChIP–seq data of the same case, the ATAC peaks were negatively correlated with the H3K27me3 levels. By contrast, the H3K27me3 mark accumulated in the tumour-associated condensed chromatin regions (Extended Data Fig.3d,e). After valemetostat treatment, the condensed regions decreased in all cases. Pt1 and Pt3, whose H3K27me3 levels were markedly diminished by valemetostat, showed relaxed chromatin structures comparable with normal cells after the treatment (Fig.2b,c). Focusing on the promoter regions, a substantial number of gene promoters were inactivated in the tumour cells at Pre (1,121 genes on average). The reduction in H3K27me3 levels by valemetostat was correlated with chromatin relaxation, reducing the number of inactivated genes to the level of normal cells in all cases (P< 0.05) (Fig.2d,eand Extended Data Fig.3f). The inactivated genes included several genes associated with T cell function and immune response. Certain TSGs22were inactivated at Pre but were restored by valemetostat (Extended Data Fig.3g,h). To further investigate the significance of chromatin structural changes on gene expression, we performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) for the PBMC samples (n= 10, 98,358 cells) (Fig.2a). Tumour cell clusters could be identified in thet-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) planar by gene mutations, viral reads and marker gene expressions (Extended Data Fig.3i). Integration with the corresponding scATAC-seq data showed a positive correlation between gene expression and promoter activity (R= 0.608). Expression of the loci with condensed chromatin promoters (cis-element value < 0.01) was inactivated with H3K27me3 (Extended Data Fig.3j,k). The integrated data demonstrated that valemetostat relaxed the chromatin structure and induced expression at the loci where H3K27me3 had been accumulated (Fig.2f,g). The chromatin accessibility of the representative H3K27me3 target genes (miR-31,BCL2L11, among others)10,14was increased by valemetostat (Fig.2h). As abnormal H3K27me3 enrichment was common at the loci of transcription factors and microRNAs, changes in H3K27me3 had various secondary effects2,10,23. A total of 246 genes (fold change > 2,P< 0.05) were commonly upregulated in ATL cells before treatment, including genes associated with cell growth and apoptosis regulation. By rectifying the epigenomic regulations upon valemetostat treatment, 89.4% of these abnormal genes were repressed (Extended Data Fig.3l,m). For the validation cohort, we further analysed the relationship between chromatin structure and gene expression patterns using single-cell multiome analysis, which involves the simultaneous detection of ATAC and gene expression profiles. We sequenced 109,830 cells and obtained ATAC and gene expression data for the same individual cells24. We found that gene expression correlated with chromatin structure (Extended Data Fig.4a–c). Furthermore, we demonstrated that changes in the chromatin structure are responsible for gene expression in tumorigenesis. We identified key genes (P< 0.05) for tumorigenesis that were silenced by aggregation of chromatin structure (Extended Data Fig.4d). Integration of the corresponding ChIP–seq data subsequently supported that regions of tumour-specific silencing had accumulated H3K27me3 marks. The decrease in H3K27me3 levels was induced by valemetostat, thereby loosening chromatin structure and inducing gene expression (Extended Data Fig.4e–g). Collectively, the results directly showed that aberrant H3K27me3 marks were eliminated in patients who received valemetostat treatment, and chromatin aggregation and gene silencing were released. Although all tested cases showed a durable response, these responses were eventually interrupted due to the recurrence of ATL. We investigated how the relapse occurred, allowing ATL cells to find fitness against the epigenetic therapy. We first identified a characteristic somatic mutation at the Y111 amino acid residue of EZH2 during clonal repopulation at progressive disease in Pt1 (Fig.3a). Among the ten cases, somatic mutations were detected in the core components of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) gene complex around the valemetostat-binding pocket in five cases (50%) (Fig.3b,c, Extended Data Fig.5a,band Supplementary Table4). All these mutations emerged within the populations of the originating clones that existed before the treatment. Tumour-specific deep sequencing (more than 2,500 coverage) could not detect such PRC2 mutations before treatment, suggesting that the mutations had newly emerged in the original clones and propagated during treatment. These mutations have not been reported in malignant lymphomas or any other cancers in vivo. In vitro studies on other EZH2 inhibitors have reported the Y111 substitution for other amino acids25,26. a, Chronological transition of VAF values (normalized by proviral load) for somatic mutations identified by deep sequencing in Pt1 in relation to treatment with valemetostat.b, Model of the PRC2–valemetostat complex superimposed on the PRC2–S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) complex, with molecular surfaces of ligands and mutation sites on EZH2 and/or EED identified in the clinical trials.c, Nested pie chart shows the proportion of PRC2 mutations and clonal characteristics at progressive disease.d, ATL cells (TL-Om1) with PRC2 mutations were treated with valemetostat (90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) or more) and monitored for outgrowth for 37 days.

Statistics and reproducibility are described in the Methods. Source Data The clinically identified amino acid substitutions (EZH2(Y111S/Y111C/Y111H/Y111N), EZH2(Y661N) and EED(H213R)) were located at the interface among EZH2, EED and valemetostat. Binding affinities predicted using the free-energy perturbation algorithm showed that the EZH2–EED interface provides a favourable platform for valemetostat. Substitution of the amino acids would significantly reduce these interactions with valemetostat (Extended Data Fig.5b–d). In addition, an EED mutation was identified in this study. The EED(H213R) substitution causes: (1) a reduction in the hydrophobic interaction of valemetostat with EZH2(Y111) and EZH2(Y661), and (2) a reduction in the rate of salt bridge formation with EED(D237), thus leading to a reduced relative affinity (0.046%). We further examined the effects of mutations at the PRC2 interface on H3K27me3. In 293T cells expressing the EZH2 or EED mutants, cellular H3K27me3 levels were retained at the untreated level, even in the presence of valemetostat (Extended Data Fig.5e). In addition, we established an ATL cell line stably expressing PRC2 mutants and performed a resistant outgrowth assay27,28in the presence of valemetostat. We found that PRC2 mutations caused the emergence of tolerant cells. These emerged cells were less sensitive to the epigenetic response invoked by valemetostat and thus were less susceptible to reactivation of the target TSGs (Fig.3dand Extended Data Fig.5f–i). Direct evaluation of the H3K27me3 level in the progressive disease clinical clones harbouringEZH2Y111S(Pt1) andEZH2Y661N(Pt8) further confirmed that tumour cells in a hypermethylated state were repopulating. The H3K27me3-low cells detected during the clinical response almost disappeared (Fig.3e). In addition, H3K27me3 ChIP–seq showed that these repopulated cells with the resistant mutation resumed the similar pattern detected before treatment, indicating that the recovery of H3K27me3 caused clinical relapse (Fig.3f). We further examined the effects of the acquired mutations on the chromatin structure. The scATAC-seq timelapse data showed that the promoters inactivated before the treatment were significantly reactivated by valemetostat. Upon the occurrence of the mutation, strong chromatin compaction of the same gene set occurred in the rapidly propagating resistant clone, demonstrating a marked tendency to revert to the original chromatin structure (Fig.3g). Furthermore, the scRNA-seq analysis confirmed the expression of the mutantEZH2in the progressive disease clone (Fig.3h). In this progressive disease clone, the expression of epigenetically inactivated genes before the treatment was also strongly silenced, corresponding well with the scATAC-seq data (Fig.3i). The evidence collectively indicates that the clonally selected mutations in PRC2 genes should be responsible for resistance, almost completely reversing the effects of valemetostat by chromatin recondensation. The characteristics of the resistant clones are summarized in Extended Data Fig.6a. We noticed that some patients showed a relapse even though the tumour levels of H3K27me3 were maintained low. In those cases, whole-genome sequencing and deep sequencing of the recurrent clones in the other patients showed no acquired mutations in PRC2 genes (Fig.3c). Nevertheless, the recurrent clones also genetically evolved, showing an increased single-nucleotide variant/insertion and deletion and copy number variations (Supplementary Tables2and3). Focusing on the epigenome-related genes, we detected a biallelic loss of function of theTET2gene in the selected progressive disease clone in Pt3 (Fig.4a). TheTET2mutation could be rarely found in ATL16and was not detected before the treatment, suggesting that the mutation was acquired during the treatment-induced selection. In Pt2, although no epigenome-related gene mutations could be detected, the scRNA-seq analysis identified robustDNMT3Aexpression, specifically in the recurrent clone (Extended Data Fig.6b,c). The scATAC-seq data showed that the enhancers of theDNMT3Alocus were activated and epigenetically evolved in the recurrent clone (Extended Data Fig.6d). In the validation cohort, patients with no detectable PRC2 mutations (Pt2 and Pt5) and a patient with anEZH2mutation but low variant allele frequency (Pt7) showed elevatedDNMT3Aand decreasedTET2levels (Extended Data Fig.6a). a, Chronological transition of normalized VAF values for somatic mutations in Pt3.b, Venn diagram depicts overlapped chromatin-condensed inactive genes (promoter sum < 0.01) in tumour cells from Pt3.

Source Data We interpreted the evolutionary impact of these epigenetic factors from scATAC-seq and found that the recurrent clones without PRC2 mutations also showed chromatin re-aggregation (Fig.4band Extended Data Figs.6eand7a). By contrast, the acquired copy number reduction observed after the relapse was more common at the active loci and not associated with the gene inactivation (Extended Data Fig.6f). Considering that abnormalities in the DNA methylation pathway were detected, we investigated the relationship between chromatin recondensation and DNA methylation in relapse. We performed the 850K DNA methylation array to quantify methylated CpG (mCpG) levels near the TSS. The progressive disease cells without PRC2 mutations showed increased DNA methylation near the TSS, where H3K27me3 was enriched (Fig.4cand Extended Data Fig.6g). We further profiled the whole-genome DNA methylation status of 28.3 million CpG sites per sample on average (96.4% of all CpG sites) using EM-seq and detected progressive disease-associated mCpG acquisition clusters in the target region of valemetostat where H3K27me3 originally accumulated (Fig.4d,eand Extended Data Fig.7b–d). Progressive disease cells (EZH2(Y111S)) from Pt1 showed no such preferential mCpG distribution. We also examined the influence of mCpG on the open chromatin structure and identified a moderate negative correlation between the increase in mCpG with recurrence and chromatin accessibility (R= −0.421). The genes characterized by the H3K27me3-related chromatin condensation were restored by valemetostat but were again strongly recondensed by mCpG gain at progressive disease (Fig.4f,gand Extended Data Fig.6h). The corresponding scRNA-seq data confirmed that this epigenetic transition was reflected in the gene expression (Fig.4hand Extended Data Fig.6i). Consequently, the gene regulation of several important TSGs restored by valemetostat was again silenced by focal compensatory mCpG acquisition (Fig.4i,jand Extended Data Figs.6jand7d). To directly verify that the DNA hypermethylation was responsible for resistance, we established a Pt2-derived progressive disease cell line. The same clonal origin and absence of PRC2 mutations were confirmed, and this cell line showed highDNMT3Aexpression and low sensitivity to valemetostat. Cell growth was inhibited byDNMT3A-targeting short hairpin RNA (shRNA), indicating that the cells became dependent on DNMT3A rather than on PRC2 (Extended Data Fig.6k–m). To validate whether DNA methylation was induced by the epigenetic selective pressure of the H3K27me3 change, we established two resistant ATL cell lines by long-term exposure (over 2 months) to valemetostat. ATN-1 cells were transformed into resistant cells preferentially expressing loss-of-functionTET2mRNA, similar to the results observed in Pt3 and Pt5. This resistant clone showed a low sensitivity to PRC2 knockdown and treatment with valemetostat. Instead, theTET2gene transfer increased sensitivity to valemetostat, suggesting that the clone is dependent onTET2(Extended Data Fig.8a–c). mCpG was increased near the TSS (Extended Data Fig.8d). ChIP–seq and RNA-seq for the resistant cell lines showed that although the H3K27me3 level remained low even after valemetostat removal, a high mCpG level on the H3K27me3 sites still had a compensatory role in repressing the expression (Extended Data Fig.8e–g). Methylation-specific PCR supported the role of TET2 in the regulation of DNA methylation (Extended Data Fig.8h). We also collected data to clarify the function of TET2 in the acquired resistance to valemetostat by molecular genetic analyses. ATN-1 cells withTET2knockdown were cultured for an extended period (2 months) to induce epigenetic evolution. TheTET2-knockdown cells showed a significant resistant outgrowth capacity and a large number of resistant clone cells emerged in the presence of valemetostat (Fig.4kand Extended Data Fig.8i–k). The emerged outgrowth clones showed reducedTET2expression and low levels of H3K27me3. Whole-genome profiling by EM-seq and methylation-specific PCR-based validation in multiple clones demonstrated the compensatory mCpG acquisition at H3K27me3 targets (Extended Data Fig.8l,m). Single-nucleotide resolution analysis of theTET2-targeting shRNA and clinically resistant Pt3 clones preferentially detected mCpG gain in the TSS regions of Polycomb targets (H3K27me3 and SUZ12) but not in outside regions (Extended Data Fig.8nand Supplementary Table5). Furthermore, clustered methylation at 3,208 CpG islands near the TSS was detected (P< 0.05), many of which were identified in H3K27me3 targets (Extended Data Fig.8o). Interestingly, these cells were sensitive to a low dose of the DNA methylation inhibitor decitabine. Growth inhibition and the reactivation of key TSGs were detected in all 16 tested clones (Extended Data Fig.8p,q). By long-term exposure to valemetostat, we also developed another resistant cell line with increasedDNMT3Aexpression and hypermethylated CpG sites, as observed in Pt2, Pt5 and Pt7. This resistant cell model showed a low sensitivity to PRC2 knockdown and treatment with valemetostat, and susceptibility was resumed by shRNA experiments against DNMT3A. The resistance-associated DNA methylation was cancelled byDNMT3A-targeting shRNA (Extended Data Fig.9a–e). Furthermore, forced expression of DNMT3A alone caused a robust resistant outgrowth in different lymphoma models (Fig.4land Extended Data Fig.9f–h). However, the outgrowth was completely inhibited when the catalytically active enzymatic domain of DNMT3A was deleted. This effect was also detected in DNMT3B-expressing cells and, although to a lesser extent, in all cell lines. Indeed, all the randomly selected clones (n= 16) showed a high DNMT3A level and were resistant to valemetostat. EM-seq demonstrated that mCpG was compensatory acquired in H3K27me3 targets, with increased methylation of mCpG clusters (Extended Data Fig.9i–kand Supplementary Table5). Co-treatment with decitabine significantly inhibited cell growth and reactivated epigenetically suppressed TSGs (Extended Data Fig.9l,m). These results indicated that DNMT3A causes an epigenetic acquisition of resistance. Overall, we concluded that despite using different genes, the common chromatin structure-based mechanism was used to acquire the resistance. All abnormalities detected in resistant cells were heritable traits selected after several months under constant treatment-related pressure. The slow emergence of such heritable clones indicates the existence of primary tolerance caused by differences in susceptibility. Reclustering the scRNA-seq data, including those remaining after treatment, yielded two subclusters with mutually distinct expression patterns (Fig.5aand Extended Data Fig.10a). The two subclusters at Pre shared the same major somatic mutations and viral integration sites, indicating that they were originally derived from the same clone. Comparing the characteristics of these subpopulations, along with a ‘clinical time order’, revealed that subcluster B (SC-B) was infrequent before treatment and at the time of response. However, the SC-B pre-existed when the eventual resistant somatic mutations emerged. The clone, which subsequently expanded and caused the relapse by acquiring the resistant mutation, shared the same mutation patterns with SC-B. Therefore, SC-B should be the origin of the resistant clones. The two clusters did not differ significantly in the expression of regulatory T lineage marker genes, which is characteristic of ATL cells. H3K27me3 target gene expression was slightly lower in SC-B than in SC-A at Pre, and this feature was maintained all the time until progressive disease (Fig.5band Extended Data Fig.10b). a,t-SNE projection of scRNA-seq data in Pt1, with cells coloured according to sample ID, subclustering based on clinical time order ork-means, and profiles of mutations and virus reads.

Source Data To characterize the molecular features differentiating SC-B from SC-A as the possible origin of the progressive disease clone, we conducted a gene set enrichment analysis. Significant enrichment of the genes associated with metabolism was observed in SC-B. In particular, the gene expression levels were higher for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes and mitochondria-related genes in SC-B (Fig.5cand Extended Data Fig.10c). These characteristics were maintained until the relapse phase. Furthermore, the expression of the ribosomal protein genes differed significantly between these two clusters. We inspected the genes associated with translation initiation and found that SC-B exhibited a relatively high expression of the eIF3 family genes. As eIF3D and eIF3E are responsible for promoting the translation of genes related to the metabolic pathways29,30, this result was consistent with the characteristics of OXPHOS. To characterize the transcriptional features, we analysed previous scRNA-seq data from another cohort18(n= 3). Results showed that similar subpopulations were observed in other cases, indicating the presence of such heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig.10d,e). SC-B showed enhanced OXPHOS characteristics and expression of eIF3 genes. Of note, the different transcriptome was not supported as changes in chromatin accessibility in the corresponding scATAC-seq data. Thus, this heterogeneity appears to be a plastic feature that is not epigenetically defined. The 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of PRC2 genes were predicted to be bound to eIF3D31(Extended Data Fig.10f). Insertion of the 5′ UTR into the upstream of luciferase resulted in increased expression, which was attenuated by eIF3D knockdown (Extended Data Fig.10g). Furthermore, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) of H3K27me3-high ATL cells showed that the mRNAs of PRC2 factors were selectively captured by eIF3D as much or more thanJUNmRNA, which is a known target of eIF3D30,31(Fig.5d). To directly examine how tumour cell subpopulations identified in scRNA-seq may be linked to responsiveness to valemetostat, cells with depleted or relatively high H3K27me3 levels were sorted from two samples after administration but before acquisition ofEZH2mutations (see Methods)32. The results showed that the low-susceptible cell population had high protein levels of OXPHOS mitochondrial factors (COX4 and TFAM), as well as eIF3 and their targets such as PRC2 factors and JUN (Fig.5e). To examine the role of the 5′ UTR, we established EZH2 5′ UTR deletion models (Δ5′ UTR) by expressing two adjacent guide RNAs and CRISPR-nickase (Cas9 D10A)33. The 5′ UTR in the generated cells lost the bulb structure necessary for binding with eIF3D and were also less stable (Extended Data Fig.10h,i). RIP of the Δ5′ UTR cells showed thatEZH2mRNA selectively reduced incorporation into the eIF3D complex and decreased polysome formation and translational efficacy (Fig.5f,gand Extended Data Fig.10j). EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels were decreased. The Δ5′ UTR ATL cells also showed decreased proliferative capacity and early response to a low concentration of valemetostat, thereby indicating that the enhanced eIF3 activity and the 5′ UTR of EZH2 are involved in sensitivity (Fig.5h,i). Moreover, knockdown of eIF3D reduced PRC2 proteins and H3K27me3 and significantly decreased cellular proliferative activities (Extended Data Fig.10k–m). Consistent with these data, progressive disease cells in Pt3 repopulated as eIF3D-high expressing cells showed characteristics of resistant cells with high H3K27me3 (Extended Data Fig.10n,o). These results support the idea that the transcriptional differences in the subclusters are involved in valemetostat sensitivity. Note that valemetostat was sufficiently effective in Pt2 who showed high OXPHOS and eIF3D/eIF3E. The clinically expected tumour reduction was also achieved, even in the presence of SC-B in Pt1 and Pt3. Although these non-genetic and non-epigenetic features may confer differences in relative susceptibility, they do not appear to act directly on resistance. This study illustrates the molecular and cellular dynamics in patients in response to an inhibitor designed for histone methyltransferases. Integration of the multilayered omics analyses and clinical resources revealed that eliminating H3K27me3 leads to the reprogramming of the cancer epigenome, thereby exerting a sustained clinical benefit. This concept is consistent with previous reports indicating that H3K27me3 exhibits a primary role in chromatin compaction1,34. The genome-wide chromatin decondensing directly leads to the restoration of TSG and could even enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic agents35. Furthermore, both treatment-naive and treatment-adapted patients displayed the characteristic condensed chromatin structures, suggesting that chromatin compaction is indispensable for tumour maintenance and growth. The resistant mutations appeared on the docking interface of EZH2 itself or on very pivotal epigenome factors with cooperative roles in gene silencing, which is particularly intriguing. Moreover, resistance emergence took a long time. The cancer cells may have limited path options to escape from the inhibitor. If that would be the case, the potential for applying combination therapies to target epigenomic abnormalities could be more significant than that of other previous anticancer drugs36,37. We hope that the epigenetic therapies presented in this study can provide a new avenue of vast opportunities for durable cancer treatment. Peripheral blood samples were collected from ten patients enrolled in valemetostat phase I (NCT02732275) or phase II (NCT04102150) trials. No statistical methods were used to determine sample size since this study was exploratory. The availability of patient recruitment thus determined the sample size. All patients with relapsed ATL cases were categorized into clinical subtypes according to Shimoyama’s criteria38. This translational study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the institutes (the University of Tokyo, the University of Ryukyus and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.). Written informed consents were obtained from all patients. PBMCs from patients with ATL were isolated by Ficoll separation (Ficoll-Paque, GE Healthcare). Clinical information, including abnormal lymphocytes and sIL-2R, was provided by the hospitals. The HTLV-1 proviral load measurement was previously described14. In brief, quantitative multiplex real-time PCR was performed with two sets of primers specific for the HTLV-1 provirus and the human gene encoding the RNase P enzyme. The proviral load was expressed as copy numbers per 100 PBMCs, assuming that infected cells had one copy of the integrated HTLV-1 provirus per cell. All clinical samples and data are provided in Supplementary Table1. ATL-derived TL-Om1 cells were provided by an established researcher K. Sugamura. ATN-1 cells were purchased from the RIKEN BRC cell bank (RCB1440). The diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell line WSU-DLCL2 was purchased from DSMZ (ACC 575). HEK293T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-3216). HEK293FT cells were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (R70007). These cell lines were verified by each cell bank or established researchers and monitored for cross-contamination. The HTLV-1-infected cell lines had been authenticated based on the provirus integration sites and somatic mutations by panel-based targeted sequencing18. Cell-surface expressions of CD4 and CADM1 were validated by flow cytometry. HTLV-1-infected, patient-derived tumour cell lines were established by long-term culture in complete medium RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) with 20% FBS (GIBCO) and 10 ng ml−1IL-2 (Peprotech). Genetic mutations and clonality of the propagating cells were confirmed by targeted sequencing. Commonly misidentified cell lines were not used in this study. The cell lines were also tested for mycoplasma contamination using mycoplasma detection PCR (6601, Takara) and were negative for mycoplasma contamination. Normal (HTLV-1-uninfected) CD4+T cells were obtained from Lonza. All lymphoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% FBS and antibiotics (Gibco). 293T and 293FT cells were cultured in DMEM (Nissui) with 10% FBS and antibiotics. All cell lines and primary cultures were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. ATL cell populations were obtained using a HAS-flow method as previously described20. Single-cell suspensions of lymphocytes were stained with fluorescent-labelled antibodies. An unlabelled CADM1 antibody (CM004-6, clone 3E1) and an isotype control chicken IgY antibody (2:100; PM084) were purchased from MBL. These were biotinylated (primary amine biotinylation) using biotinN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma-Aldrich). Anti-CD14–Pacific orange antibody (MHCD1430, clone TuK4) was purchased from Invitrogen. All other antibodies were obtained from BioLegend. Cells were stained using a combination of anti-CADM1–biotin (1:100; CM004-6, MBL), anti-CD7–APC (5:100; clone CD7-6B7), anti-CD3–APC–Cy7 (5:100; clone SK7), anti-CD4–Pacific blue (5:100; clone RPA-T4) and anti-CD14–Pacific orange (5:100) antibodies. After washing, phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (2:100; SA10041, Thermo Fisher Scientific for phase I study; 1:80; 554061, BD Biosciences for phase II study) was applied. Propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) or 7-AAD (51-68981, BD Biosciences) was added to the samples to stain dead cells immediately before flow cytometry. For intracellular staining of the H3K27me3, we improved the HAS-Flow method. First, PBMCs (5 × 106) were washed and incubated with Ghost Dyes viability dye (Tonbo Biosciences). Then, the cells were stained using a combination of anti-CD3–APC–Cy7, anti-CD4–Pacific blue, anti-CD7–phycoerythrin–Cy7 (5:100; clone M-T701), anti-CD14–Pacific orange (or BV510 for phase II study), anti-CADM1–biotin and streptavidin–phycoerythrin. The surface-stained cells were then fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix fixation buffer (554655, BD Biosciences) and BD Phosflow Perm buffer IV (560746, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After washing, the permeabilized cells were stained with anti-H3K27me3–Alexa Flour 488 (1:200; 5499, clone C36B11, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-histone H3–Alexa Fluor 647 (1:400; 12230, clone D1H2, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-rabbit IgG isotype control–Alexa Flour 488 (1:400; 4340, clone DA1E, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-rabbit IgG isotype control–Alexa Flour 647 (1:400; 3452, clone DA1E, Cell Signaling Technology). FACSAria II or FACSLyric instrument (BD Biosciences) was used for multicolour flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The collected data were analysed by FlowJo software (v10.7.1, Tree Star). CD4+CADM1+CD7−cells and CD4+CADM1−CD7+cells were analysed as malignant ATL cells and non-malignant cells, respectively. Tumour H3K27me3 levels (mean fluorescence intensity) were calculated by normalization with the data of normal CD4+T cells. Genomic DNA from enriched cell populations, PBMC, buccal swabs and cell lines were extracted using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). Target capture was conducted using the SureSelect Target Enrichment System (Agilent Technologies). To comprehensively cover genes involved in ATL, 280 human genes were selected, including 50 genes frequently mutated in ATL16and 190 genes frequently mutated in haematological and solid malignancies. Agilent SureDesign web-based application was used for capture bait design as previously described18. The sequence data were obtained using the HiSeq2500 or NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina) with 100-bp paired-end reads. The sequenced data were aligned to the human reference genome hg38 by BWA (v0.7.15) software. The PCR duplicates were removed using Picard (v2.92) and SAMtools (v1.2) software39. Matched buccal DNA was used as matched normal controls to call somatic mutations. The somatic mutation candidates were called using MuTect2 from GATK (v4.0.12) software40and annotated with ANNOVAR (v20191024)41. Candidate mutations, with (1) 5 or more variant reads in tumour samples, (2) a variant allele frequency in tumour samples 0.01 or more, (3) read depth of 200 or more, and (4) tumour variant with a normal variant ratio of 2 or more, were adopted and further filtered by excluding synonymous SNVs. The clonality analysis of HTLV-1-infected cells was performed by high-throughput sequencing-based mapping of proviral integration sites18. To designate the virus integration sites, sequence reads were aligned to human reference genome hg38 and the virus genome (NC_001436.1) by BWA. Paired-end reads spanning the viral and human genomes and soft-clipped reads (15 bp or more soft-clipped region) were extracted using Perl scripts and then validated by Blastn (v2.6.0+). The clonality was calculated as the population size of each clone by counting the extracted reads at host–provirus junction sites. We used PyClone (v0.13.0)42for the analysis of subclonal population structure and reconstruct hierarchical trees. PyClone is based on a Bayesian clustering method, which uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo-based framework to estimate cellular prevalence values using somatic mutations. The somatic mutation candidates for PyClone were called using MuTect2, with (1) 5 or more variant reads in tumour samples, (2) a variant allele frequency in tumour samples of 0.05 or more, (3) a read depth of 200 or more, and (2) tumour variant with a normal variant ratio of 2 or more. The clonal composition was investigated based on the β-binomial emission model, through which a set of clones with a discrete set of mutations (mutational clusters) were imputed together with their estimated clone size. The process of the clonal evolution was estimated by extrapolation of the estimated clone sizes at all tested time points. The hierarchical trees with imputed mutational subclusters were depicted by ClonEvol (v0.99.11) based on the results of clustering and cellular prevalence from the PyClone model. For whole-genome sequencing, somatic variant detection was carried out using next-generation sequencing by Azenta Japan Corporation (formerly, Genewiz Japan). In brief, genomic DNA from patient PBMC and matched buccal swabs were quantified and qualified by NanoDrop, Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Thermo Fisher) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Of genomic DNA, 1 µg was sheared into approximately 350 bp in size by an ultrasonicator (Covaris) followed by DNA purification and confirmation of DNA fragment size. Essentially, an entire amount of fragmented genomic DNA was used for library preparation with a PCR-free method (MGIEasy PCR-Free DNA Library Prep Set, MGI tech). The resulting whole-genome sequencing libraries were quantified by Qubit dsDNA HS assay and their fragment size distribution was confirmed by TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent). The libraries in the double-stranded DNA form were further processed into single-stranded circular DNA, which is the final form of the MGI sequencing library. The single-stranded circular DNA libraries were quantified by Qubit ssDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher) and used for generating DNA nanoballs by rolling circle replication reaction. DNA nanoballs were then loaded into a flow cell for sequencing on DNBSEQ-G400 platform (MGI tech) with 150 bp paired-end configuration, according to the manufacturer′s instructions, yielding approximately 320 Gb in data amount per library. Sequence data cleaning was performed by the Cutadapt software (v1.9.1)43. The Sentieon pipeline (https://www.sentieon.com/products/) was used to call germline single-nucleotide variant/indel and somatic variations. Copy number variation was detected by Control-FREEC44. Total RNA of each sample was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified and qualified by the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies), NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% agarose gel. Of total RNA with an RNA integrity number (RIN) value above 7, 20 ng was used following library preparation. The library preparation and sequencing were processed and analysed by Genewiz. The libraries with different indices were multiplexed and loaded on an Illumina HiSeq instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Sequencing was carried out using a 2 × 150-bp paired-end configuration; image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HiSeq control software (HCS v2.2.38 or later) plus OLB plus GAPipeline-1.6 (Illumina) on the HiSeq instrument. For quality control, to remove technical sequences, including adapters, PCR primers or fragments thereof, and quality of bases lower than 20, pass filter data of fastq format were processed by Trimmomatic (v0.30) to be high-quality clean data. For mapping, Hisat2 (v2.0.1) was used to index the reference genome sequence. Finally, clean data were aligned to the reference genome via the software Hisat2. The single-cell RNA-seq library was constructed using the Chromium Controller and Chromium NextGEM Single Cell ATAC Reagent Kits v1.1 (10x Genomics) following the standard manufacturer’s protocols. To collect live cells for ATAC-seq, PBMC cryovials (1–10 × 106cells per 1 ml of CELLBANKER 1 (Zenoaq resource)) were removed from liquid nitrogen or −80 °C freezer and warmed in a 37 °C water bath. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 500gfor 5 min and resuspended in PBS. After twice washing with PBS, nuclei isolation was conducted by the 10x Chromium standard protocol. Chilled lysis buffer (100 µl) was added to the pellet, then incubated for 3 min on ice. Chilled wash buffer (1 ml) was added immediately to the lysed cell, followed by two washes. Then, the lysed cell was resuspended in an appropriate volume of chilled diluted nuclei buffer, and 1.6 × 104nuclei were immediately incubated in a transposition mix to recover 10,000 nuclei. After transposition, the sample was loaded onto the 10x Chromium controller to recover 10,000 nuclei. Gel beads were prepared according to standard manufacturer’s protocols. Oil partitions of single nuclei with oligo-coated gel beads (GEMs) were captured and thermal cycling was performed, resulting in single-stranded DNA tagged with a 10x cell barcode. The library was sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For ATAC libraries, sequencing was performed using a 50 × 49-bp paired-end configuration following the manufacturer’s protocol. After sequencing analysis, fastq files were created by the Cell Ranger atac ver2.0.1 mkfastq pipeline (10x Genomics). The obtained fastq files were mapped to the reference genome provided by 10x Genomics (GRCh38). The Cell Ranger atac count pipeline (v2.0.1) was used to perform demultiplexing, aligning reads, filtering, peak calling, clustering and motif activity analyses, using default parameters. The Cell Ranger data were imported into the Loupe Cell Browser software (v6.0.0) fort-SNE-based clustering, heat map generation and promoter activity plots. The scRNA-seq library was constructed using the Chromium Controller and Chromium Single Cell 5′ Reagent Kits and 3′ Reagent Kits v2 (10x Genomics) following the standard manufacturer’s protocols. To collect live cells for scRNA-seq, PBMC cryovials (1–10 × 106cells per 1 ml of CELLBANKER 1) were removed from liquid nitrogen or −80 °C freezer and warmed in a 37 °C water bath. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 500gfor 5 min and resuspended in PBS. After twice washing with PBS, cells were then pipetted through a 40-μm filter to remove cell doublets and contamination. Cell viability (more than 60%) was confirmed by trypan blue staining. The collected single-cell suspension from PBMCs (1.6 × 104live cells per sample) was immediately loaded onto the 10x Chromium Controller to recover thousands of cells from each subpopulation for library preparation and sequencing. Gel beads were prepared according to the standard manufacturer’s protocols. Oil partitions of single cell with GEMs were captured and reverse transcription was performed, resulting in cDNA tagged with a cell barcode and unique molecular index (UMI). The library was sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was carried out using a 1 × 91–98-bp single-end configuration (default setting), which is sufficient to align confidentially to the transcriptome. After sequencing analysis, fastq files were created by the Cell Ranger ver3.1.0 mkfastq pipeline (10x Genomics). The obtained fastq files were mapped to the reference genome provided by 10x Genomics (GRCh38). The Cell Ranger count pipeline (v3.1.0) was used to perform demultiplexing, aligning reads, filtering, clustering and gene expression analyses, using default parameters. In brief, after read trimming, Cell Ranger used an aligner called STAR, which performs splicing-aware alignment of reads to the genome. Cell Ranger further aligned exonic and intronic confidently mapped reads to annotated transcripts by examining their compatibility with the transcriptome. Only uniquely mapping exonic reads were carried forward to UMI counting. After the UMI filtering steps with default parameters and expected cell counts, each observed barcode, UMI and gene combination was recorded as a UMI count in the feature–barcode matrix. The workflow also performed an improved calling cell barcodes algorithm, identified the primary mode of high RNA content cells and also captured low RNA content cells. After data processing, we recovered quality-assured data for secondary analysis of gene expression. To correct batch effects between time points, we used a Cell Ranger merge algorithm. To regress out the cell–cell variation in gene expression driven by batch and cluster data with corrected data in different time points, we used a standard Seurat v3 integration workflow with functions FindIntegrationAnchors() and IntegrateData(). The Cell Ranger data or batch-corrected data were imported into Loupe Cell Browser software (v6.0.0) fort-SNE-based clustering, heat map generation and gene expression distribution plots. The single-cell multiome (scMultiome) libraries were constructed by using Chromium Controller and 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC plus Gene Expression following the standard manufacturer’s protocols (CG000365 Rev C, CG000338 Rev F, 10x Genomics). The libraries were sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For ATAC libraries, sequencing was performed using a 50 × 49-bp paired-end configuration. RNA library sequencing was performed using a 28 × 91-bp paired-end configuration. The scMultiome dataset was first processed using Cell Ranger ARC v2.0.0 (Cell Ranger ARC, 10x Genomics). BCL files were converted into fastq using the command cellranger_ark mkfastq with default parameter. The fastq files were then processed by cellranger_ark count and merged by cellranger-arc aggr. To remove batch effect, the scMultiome RNA dataset was processed by Seurat (v4.3.0)24reciprocal principal component analysis (clustering parameters principal component analysis dimensions 1–30, resolution 0.5). The scMultiome ATAC dataset was recounted by Signac (v1.9.0)45using the merged peak bed files and processed by Harmony (v0.1.1)46. RNA variants from scRNA-seq data were validated from curated BAM files based on the results of Cell Ranger. For each cell barcode in the filtered Cell Ranger barcode list, and each somatic variant in the targeted sequencing data, variant bases were identified. Only reads with a Chromium cellular barcode tag and a Chromium molecular barcode tag were included. We then obtained the cell-associated tag for downstream analysis of UMIs. Chromium cellular barcode tags with the variant reads extracted by SAMtools were defined as at least one mutant read detected and mapped on eacht-SNE projection using Loupe Cell Browser software. Almost variants were validated by manual review to identify mutant cells accurately. One-sided Fisher’s exact tests were used to identify cell clusters that were enriched for somatic mutations (P< 0.05). For detection of virus reads from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, we processed Cell Ranger GRCh38-aligned sequence data. No-map and soft-clipped reads (more than 20 bp soft-clipped) were extracted using Python scripts. The pass-filter data of fastq format were processed to remove adopter and polyA sequences. The high-quality clean data were then aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) and virus genome (NC_001436.1) via the software STAR. For detection of cells expressing virus genes, Chromium cellular barcode tags with virus reads were defined as at least one virus read detected. Almost virus-aligned reads were derived from the antisense strand. Both host-aligned and virus-aligned soft-clipped reads were extracted as host–virus chimeric reads. Genomic breakpoints of chimeric reads were analysed from supplementarily mapped data from STAR alignment to link the clone-specific chimeric reads with the viral integration sites identified in the corresponding clones. The extracted Chromium cellular barcode tags with virus antisense reads or clone-specific host–virus chimeric reads were mapped ont-SNE projection using the Loupe Cell Browser. One-sided Fisher’s exact tests were used to identify cell clusters that were enriched for virus reads (P< 0.05). Promoter activity (promoter sum) and expression patterns ofCD4,CADM1andCD7were used and overlaid on thet-SNE to identify ATL tumour clusters using the Loupe Cell Browser. Chromium cellular barcodes with HTLV-1-derived antisense transcripts (scRNA-seq) and proviral DNA reads (scATAC-seq) were overlaid on thet-SNE. The HTLV-1-derived reads served for inference of infected cells (P< 0.05). Infected clone-specific host–virus chimeric reads were significantly enriched in each cluster (P< 0.05). To detect the mutation-harbouring clones estimated by PyClone, RNA variants from scRNA-seq data were validated from curated BAM files based on the results of Cell Ranger. Chromium cellular barcode tags with variant reads were defined as at least one mutant read detected and mapped on eacht-SNE projection (P< 0.05). log2Fold change and median-normalized average values of assigned clusters were obtained via the Loupe Cell Browser and used in the following analysis of differentially expressed genes within each cluster. Manual clustering based on expression patterns was curated by original Python scripts or polygonal selection tool (Loupe Cell Browser interface). Tumour cells (1 × 107) sorted by surface markers (CD4+CADM1+CD7−) or normal CD4+T cells from HTLV-1-negative healthy donors were fixed by adding 1/10 volume of freshly prepared formaldehyde solution (11% (v/v) formaldehyde, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.9)) to the existing media or PBS and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Fixation was stopped by adding 1/20 volume of a 1.25 M glycine solution and incubating for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were collected and washed twice with chilled PBS with 0.5% (v/v) Igepal. The cell pellet was snap-frozen on dry ice. Further processing and ChIP experiments including chromatin extraction, fragmentation, antibody precipitation and library preparation were performed at Active Motif using validated antibodies to H3K27me3 (39155, polyclonal, Active Motif), H3K27ac (39133, polyclonal, Active Motif) and SUZ12 (39357, polyclonal, Active Motif). Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from the ChIP and input DNAs by the standard consecutive enzymatic steps of end-polishing, dA-addition and adaptor ligation. After a final PCR amplification step, the resulting DNA libraries were quantified and sequenced on NextSeq 500 from Illumina (75-nt reads, single end). Reads were aligned to the human genome (hg38) using the BWA algorithm (v0.7.12). Duplicate reads were removed, and only uniquely mapped reads (mapping quality ≥ 25) were used for further analysis. Alignments were extended in silico at their 3′ ends to a length of 200 bp, which is the average genomic fragment length in the size-selected library, and assigned to 32-nt bins along the genome. The resulting histograms (genomic ‘signal maps’) were stored in bigWig files. Peak call for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 were performed using the SICER algorithm (v1.1) with a cut-offP= 10−10. Peak call for H3K27ac was performed using the MACS algorithm (v2.1.0) with a cut-offP= 10−7. Peaks that were on the ENCODE blacklist of known false ChIP–seq peaks were removed. Signal maps and peak locations were used as input data to the Active Motifs proprietary analysis program, which creates Excel tables containing detailed information on sample comparison, peak metrics, peak locations and gene annotations. EaSeq software (v1.111)47was also used to calculate each peak value and create heat maps. For the TSS plot, the ChIP–seq dataset was normalized by input data and visualized by Deeptools (v3.3.1)48. For DNA methylation profiling, genomic DNA was extracted from enriched tumour cell populations (CD4+CADM1+CD7−) and cell lines using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen). DNA methylation levels were analysed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (more than 850,000 probes) (Illumina). Quality testing of the double-stranded DNA was performed by measuring absorbance with NanoDrop2000 and fluorescence with Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by quality testing by agarose gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA was used for bead array analysis by iScan (Illumina) according to the Infinium HD methylation protocol guide, manual protocol (15019519 v01). Bisulfite conversion, hybridization and further data processing were performed at Takara Bio. In brief, bisulfite conversion of 250 ng of genomic DNA was performed using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research). The bisulfite-converted DNA was alkaline denatured and subjected to enzymatic whole-genome amplification. The amplified genomic DNA was fragmented by enzyme, purified by isopropanol precipitation and resuspended in buffer. The resuspended DNA was heat denatured and applied to the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip for hybridization at 48 °C in an oven for approximately 23 h. After hybridization, the BeadChip was washed with buffer, and a single nucleotide labelled at the probe end was incorporated by a single-nucleotide elongation reaction. The hybridized genomic DNA was then denatured, removed and stained with a fluorescent dye-labelled antibody against the incorporated labelled nucleotide. The stained BeadChip was washed, coated, dried and then fluorescence images were acquired using iScan. Normalization by background subtraction and internal controls was performed using GenomeStudio (V2011.1) or Methylation Module (v1.9.0) to analyse the acquired fluorescence image data. Each CpG site was annotated by distance from the TSS of the genes (hg38). Only CpG sites within ±5 kb of the TSS were used for further integrative analyses. The β-value was used as the methylation level (%), and probes that fluctuated more than 10% were defined as differentially methylated sites. BigWig files were created using the Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationship (ELMER) package with the function createBigWigDNAmetArray(). For whole-genome DNA methylation analyses of patient specimens and established resistant models, we performed EM-seq49. The libraries of EM-seq were prepared from 50 ng of DNA using the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq Kit (New England BioLabs). Paired-end sequencing of 150 bp was performed using NovaSeq 6000. The EM-seq dataset was adapter-timmed by Trim Galore v0.6.7 with the default parameters. The trimmed reads were aligned to hg38 using Bismark (v0.22.3)50. PCR duplicates were removed using deduplicate_bismark with default parameter. The methylation information was extracted with a bismark_methylation_extractor. The methylation information had a filtered depth of more than five. Differential methylated regions were extracted using metilene (v0.2-8)51(P< 0.05). All methylated CpG sites were also analysed at single-nucleotide resolution from the EM-seq data. The methylation information bedGraphs of bismark outputs were converted to BigWig by bedGraphToBigWig and visualized by Integrative Genomics Viewer. Methylation levels of target genes were calculated by Deeptools v3.3.1 and visualized by Deeptools plotProfile. The Integrative Genomics Viewer tool52was used for visualizing and interpreting the results of DNA-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP–seq and DNA methylation data. For differentially expressed gene analysis, HTSeq (v0.6.1) estimated gene and convert read counts to transcripts per million from the paired-end clean data. Selected genes were subjected to the hierarchical clustering analysis using the iDEP.91 pipeline that contains the DESeq2 package53. Gene set enrichment analysis54was performed using GSEA software (v4.1.0) (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) with 1,000 permutations. Gene sets used in this study were selected from the MSigDB hallmark gene sets (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp). Significantly enriched gene sets were evaluated by normalized enrichment score (NES) and nominalPvalue (P< 0.001). Gene ontology analysis was performed by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/). Box plots, beeswarm plots, violin plots, hierarchical clustering and correlation matrix were analysed and visualized by using R (v3.2.3). Box plots are defined as follows: the middle line corresponds to the median; the lower and upper hinges correspond to first and third quartiles; the upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 times the IQR from the hinge (where the IQR is the interquartile range or distance between the first and third quartiles); and the lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 times the IQR of the hinge. All data points are overlaid on the box plot. The valemetostat-bound PRC2 structure was modelled as previously described11. Amino acid residue numbers for EED in the PRC2 model were renumbered based on UniProtO75530isoform 1 (identifier:O75530-1). Binding free-energy changes (ΔΔGs) of valemetostat to PRC2 single-point mutants (EZH2(Y111S/Y111C/Y111H/Y111N), EZH2(Y661N) and EED(H213R)) relative to wild-type PRC2 were predicted by the free-energy perturbation (FEP) method55,56using FEP protein mutation for ligand selectivity (Schrödinger release 2021-3: FEP+, Schrödinger, 2021) with default settings and the OPLS4 force field57. The value of ΔΔGfor EZH2(Y111H) was defined as the mean of ΔΔGs for EZH2(Y111) mutated to histidine neutral tautomers, Nδ-protonated (Hid) and Nε-protonated (Hie), respectively. Hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, and water bridges between valemetostat and wild-type or mutant PRC2s were examined throughout 5-ns molecular dynamics simulations using edge analysis of FEP protein mutation analysis (Schrödinger release 2021-3: FEP+, Schrödinger) to elucidate the effect of these mutations in PRC2 on valemetostat binding. Structural model figures were generated using PyMOL (v2.4.0, Schrödinger). Relative affinities of valemetostat to PRC2 mutants were predicted by FEP simulations and calculated as wild-type dissociation constant (Kd)/(wild-type or mutantKd) = exp(−ΔΔG/RT), whereRis the ideal gas constant (1.987 cal K–1mol–1) andTis the absolute temperature (298.15 K). EZH2andEEDcDNAs were subcloned into the pME-FLAG vector. Point mutagenesis for generating resistant mutants was accomplished with the PrimeSTAR Mutagenesis Basal Kit (Takara) and specific primer sets (Supplementary Table6). The generated mutant cDNAs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Transient transfection of FLAG-tagged cDNA in 293T cells was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). At 24 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with valemetostat and cultured for 5 days. The subsequent H3K27me3 level was evaluated by immunoblotting with primary antibodies (anti-H3K27me3 (1:1,000; 07-449, Merck/Millipore), anti-histone H3 total (1:1,000; ab10799, Abcam) and anti-FLAG M2 (1:1,000; F1804, Sigma)). ATL cell lines were cultured in growth media supplemented with 10 nM of valemetostat for 2 months. Inhibitor-resistant outgrowth was observed at 100 nM. For knockdown ofTET2,DNMT3A,DNMT3Band PRC2 genes, a replication-defective, self-inactivating lentivirus vector (CS-H1-Venus-IRES-Bsd) was used (Riken, BRC). We designed three shRNA sequences (Supplementary Table6) and cloned them into CS-RfA-EVBsd via pENTR4-H1. For stable expression of wild-type and mutant EZH2 and EED in lymphoma cells, FLAG-tagged cDNAs were subcloned into lentivirus vector CSII-EF-MCS-IRES2-Venus (Riken). For stable expression of DNMT in lymphoma cells, haemagglutinin-taggedDNMT3AandDNMT3BcDNA were subcloned into the lentivirus vector pHIV-dTomato (Addgene #21374). DNMT3A(E629stop), which lacks the C-terminal enzymatic domain, was also generated for a negative control. ATET2-encoded lentivirus vector was purchased from VectorBuilder (pLV-Puro-EF1A-hTET2). The established viral vectors were co-transfected with the packaging plasmid (pCAG-HIVgp) and the VSV-G-expressing and Rev-expressing plasmid (pCMV-VSV-G-RSV-Rev) into 293FT cells. High-titre viral solutions were prepared by centrifugation-based concentration and used for transduction into cell lines. The infection was attained by the spinoculation method and then cultured in an appropriate condition for 5–7 days. Blasticidin (10 μg ml−1) was used to select the transduced population. Expression of fluorescent proteins (Venus and dTomato) was confirmed by flow-cytometory using FACSCalibur or FACSymphony A1 (BD Biosciences), or by automated cell counter using Countess 3 FL (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Expression levels of DNMT3A and DNMT3B were evaluated by immunoblotting with primary antibodies as follows: anti-DNMT3A (1:1,000; 3598, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-DNMT3B (1:1,000; 57868, Cell Signaling Technology). Alternatively, knockdown and gene induction efficiencies were evaluated by qRT–PCR with specific primer sets (Supplementary Table6). For evaluation of the anti-growth activity of valemetostat, lymphoma cell models (2 × 105) were plated in 12-well flat bottom plates with optimized media with 10% FBS and simultaneously treated with indicated doses of valemetostat solution in DMSO for 14 days. The cells were maintained by passage into fresh media every 3–4 days. The cell numbers were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (WST-8 assay, Dojindo) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Valemetostat used in this study was synthesized in-house. Genomic DNA (1 μg) was converted with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen). The converted DNA (200 ng) was amplified by KOD -multi & Epi- DNA polymerase (Toyobo) with methylated or unmethylated specific primer pairs for CpG islands withinCDKN1A,CDKN1CandBCL2L11promoters (Supplementary Table6). The PCR products were analysed by 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. To evaluate the ability of PRC2 mutants, DNMT3A, DNMT3B andTET2-targeting shRNA to acquire resistance to valemetostat, a resistance outgrowth assay27,28in the presence of valemetostat was performed. Lymphoma cells expressing each gene or negative control cells were cultured with valemetostat at IC90or higher for 1 week. Then, 10 cells per well were spread on 96-well plates and cultured in the presence of valemetostat with successive passages for more than 1 month. The cumulative cell count in each well was then measured using the WST-8 assay to determine the percentage of wells that outgrowth in the presence of valemetostat. Growth suppression resistance of the randomly collected outgrowth clones was evaluated. Gene expression levels were also evaluated by qRT–PCR. To evaluate the effect of DNA methylation, additional cultures were maintained for 1 week in the presence of a low concentration (10 nM) of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine from Merck) and subsequent gene expression and cell counts were evaluated. For the 5′ UTR reporter assay, 5′ UTR sequences of EZH1, EZH2, SUZ12 and EED were amplified from the human genomic DNA region with specific primers (Supplementary Table6) and inserted into the BamHI site upstream of the start codon of pMIR-REPORT (Promega). The orientation of the inserted 5′ UTR was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The luciferase activities were quantified by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) 2 days after transfection. The CRISPR–Cas9-based ‘double nicking’33was applied to delete a part of the endogenous EZH2 5′ UTR. To minimize nonspecific effects of guide RNA (gRNA) and to induce some length of deletion on the UTR, a double-nicking strategy with Cas9 nickase (Cas D10A) and double gRNA was used to introduce double-stand breaks at the target site. The gRNAs were designed using the CRISPR gRNA Design tool (DNA2.0) from the target sequence within EZH2 5′ UTR (cggtgggactcagaaggcagtggagccccggcggcggcggcggcggcgcgcgg; PAM sequences at both ends). The gRNA sequences are provided in Supplementary Table6. An all-in-one vector (All-in-One Nickase Ninja vector, pD1421-AD), which can express two gRNAs and Cas9, was constructed and introduced into 293T and TL-Om1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 h, GFP-positive cells were sorted. The 5′ UTR sequences of ten clones in TA-cloning were analysed by Sanger sequencing to confirm that deletion was occurring. The secondary structure and free-energy change of the 5′ UTR sequence were predicted using the mfold tool58. The CRISPR-transduced cells were used as bulk culture and characterized. For the RIP assay, cells (2 × 107) were washed with PBS and lysed with 1 ml of RNA lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor cocktail and 100 U ml−1RNase inhibitor (Takara)). After incubation on ice for 20 min, the cells were centrifuged at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm for 20 min to obtain cell lysate. Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen) was added to the lysate and rotated at 4 °C for 15 min to remove proteins nonspecifically bound to the beads. For antibody-bound beads, Dynabeads protein G was washed and inculcated with anti-eIF3D (A301-758A, Bethyl Laboratories), anti-eIF3A (2013, Cell Signaling Technology) or control IgG (2729, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies for 10 min. The prepared antibody-binding beads were added to the cell lysate and slowly rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing five times with RNA lysis buffer, beads were mixed with 1 ml of TRIzol. The collected RNA was subjected to reverse-transcriptase reaction using ReverTra Ace qRT–PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) with the manufacturer’s protocol. Random primer-based synthesized cDNA was analysed by quantitative PCR using a real-time PCR system (Thermal cycler Dice, Takara).EZH2andJUNmRNA levels were quantified using gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table6). For evaluation of the translation activity ofEZH2mRNA, the amount of mRNA in the ribosomal and polysomal fractions was quantified using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The 15–40% sucrose density gradient solution (containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 100 μg ml−1cycloheximide) was prepared in a centrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter). Cells (2 × 107) were washed with PBS containing 100 μg ml−1cycloheximide for 5 min, then lysed with polysome lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 U ml−1RNase inhibitor, 100 μg ml−1cycloheximide and protease inhibitor) and then placed on top of the density gradient solution. The lysates were then centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C using SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). Twenty-four fractions were collected in 500-µl portions, and the absorbance was measured at 254 nm using a NanoDrop. RNA was extracted from each fraction using ISOGEN-LS (Nippon Gene), and theEZH2mRNA level in each fraction was quantified by qRT–PCR. For protein analysis of the subpopulations with different H3K27me3, total proteins from the fixed cells were extracted for immunoblotting according to a previous study32. The fixed proteins could be liberated from formaldehyde crosslinking in the presence of high heat, 500 mM Tris and 2% SDS. In brief, H3K27me3-depleted and relatively H3K27me3-high tumour cells were sorted from the two post-dose blood samples and then sonicated in 200 µl of modified fixed tissue lysis buffer (500 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 25 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) IGEPAL, 2% (w/v) SDS and protease inhibitor cocktail). Homogenates were incubated at 90 °C for 120 min, followed by centrifugation at 4 °C. Protein levels of the collected supernatants were analysed by immunoblotting. For eIF3D knockdown, the lentivirus vector CS-H1-Venus-IRES-Bsd was used with two shRNA sequences (Supplementary Table6). Protein levels of eIF3D, PRC2 factors and H3K27me3 were analysed by immunoblotting with primary antibodies, as follows; anti-EZH1 (1:1,000; 42088, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-EZH2 (1:1,000; 3147, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-SUZ12 (1:1,000; 3737, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-EED (1:1,000; 85322, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-eIF3D (1:1,000; A301-758A, Bethyl Laboratories), anti-H3K27me3 (1:1,000; 07-449, Merck/Millipore), anti-COX4 (1:1,000; 4850, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-TFAM (1:1,000; 8076, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-JUN (1:1,000; 9165, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-β-actin (1:1,000; sc-69879, Santa Cruz). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:2,000; S3721, Promega) and anti-rabbit (1:2,000; S3731, Promega) secondary antibodies and BCIP/NBT substrate (S3771, Promega) were used for detection. All bar and line graphs that summarize multiple datasets show mean values. The middle lines within box plots indicate median values. Significant differences in gene expression and other biological assays between the two groups were analysed by a two-sided Student’st-test. Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons. Correlations between two groups were analysed by a two-sided Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and probabilities of overlap between gene sets were statistically tested. For electrophoresis of samples with cell lines, representative data from two to three independent repeat experiments are shown. Because experiments on multiple outgrowth clones are verified for reproducibility by examining multiple samples of interest, electrophoresis was performed only once. In addition, electrophoresis experiments with multiple independent patient samples were performed once.

They also demonstrated in clinical trials the efficacy of the drug in reducing tumor growth in blood cancer. The findings could lead to longer-term treatments for the disease and therapies for other types of cancer with similar underlying causes.
A team of researchers from the University of Tokyo and their collaborators focused on therapies targeting H3K27me3, a modification on a DNA-packaging histone protein, which plays a large role in regulating gene expression. The modification occurs when methyl groups, each consisting of three hydrogen atoms bonded to a single carbon atom (CH3), are added to the protein in a process called methylation.
The modification, also referred to as being epigenetic (a heritable change in gene function that occurs without altering the sequence of the DNA), has been tied to the repression, or reducing the expression, of tumor suppressor genes, with the accumulation of the methylated histones around the genes.
Because of its effects on repressing genes, H3K27me3 is being targeted by therapies to correct some of the disordered gene expression observed in cancer cells. While this therapy is effective for some cancers, the mechanism of H3K27me3 therapies on tumor cells was not yet known.
The research team conducted a study characterizing the effects of H3K27me3 on cancer cells by treating patients who have adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), a rare type of blood cancer, with valemetostat. The drug prevents the methylation of histone H3 by inhibiting the histone-modifying enzymes EZH1 and EZH2, which increase H3K27 and have been found to be abnormal in cancers. Treating patients with valemetostat decreased H3K27me3 and the condensation of DNA, opening up several tumor-suppressor genes for expression in cancer cells.
“Before H3K27me3-inhibitor therapies were developed, no effective treatments for blood cancers with accumulated genetic abnormalities existed, and new treatments needed to be developed,” said Makoto Yamagishi, first author of the paper and associate professor at the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences at the University of Tokyo. “Once we established that these therapies were effective against some types of cancer, understanding the therapeutic mechanisms of these drugs became extremely important.”
The team established that valemetostat treatment decreased tumor size and produced a durable clinical response to therapy in the clinical trial of patients with ATL, an aggressive cancer with many genetic mutations. The patients were able to safely remain on valemetostat treatment for more than two years.
“In blood cancers with poor prognosis due to genetic abnormalities, epigenetic mechanisms mediated by methylated histones can be targeted therapeutically,” said Professor Kaoru Uchimaru, also of the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences and last author of the study. “Valemetostat can restore expression of many tumor suppressor genes and sustainably inhibit tumor cell growth.”
Characterizing the mechanism of valemetostat therapy in patients with ATL is a huge step forward for epigenetic cancer treatments that target the expression of genes in cancer cells. The team recognizes, however, that many challenges remain. Cancers can become resistant to H3K27me3-inhibitor therapies if patients are treated for long periods of time, allowing cancer to recur. In some cases, cancer cells had acquired new mutations that interfered with valemetostat’s effectiveness over time and reduced long-term patient response to the drug.
“EZH1/2 inhibitors are effective treatments, but a mechanism of resistance to long-term treatment has also been identified,” said Yamagishi. “Based on this mechanism of resistance, it is important to continue to improve treatment methods and develop combination therapies that provide longer-term therapeutic effects.”

Particularly with regards to micro pests that are not only highly resistant to various insecticides but also because we are running out of options for which insecticide to use against them, resulting in enormous economic damage worldwide. Here we report that the effectiveness of the conventional insect net can be greatly advanced by changing their color to red that helps significantly reduce pesticide use. We demonstrate the red effect using Onion thrips,Thrips tabacia main vector of Iris Yellow Spot Virus (IYSV) and Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV) that cause serious damage to various vegetables. New red nets succeeded in suppressing the invasion rates and damages (white spots on the leaves) in a Welsh onion greenhouse with minimum use of pesticides. We discuss how red nets are compatible with labor-saving, sustainable agriculture and the future potential of “optical pest control” based on insect color vision and its behavioral response. In agricultural production, pest control is as much a factor harming Earth’s environment as chemical fertilizers and fossil fuels. Therefore, new technologies and ideas are needed for pest control to support sustainable food production. Since the time pest control relying on powerful synthetic insecticides started in the 1960s, a control method that combines different environmentally friendly techniques called Integrated Pest Management, IPM, has been explored1,2. For example, an IPM method combining natural predators and attractants including pheromones, has been used to suppress pest densities below economically acceptable levels. Another example is insect nets, which have been traditionally used in agricultural production just like mosquito nets are popularly used for protection fromAnophelesmosquitoes in bedrooms3,4. In agriculture, insect nets generally use a fine mesh to “physically” prevent pests from entering cultivation facilities5,6,7,8. The red colored insect net presented in this paper is a novel pest control method that is based on color recognition by the insect compound eye. Even though the red insect net has a mesh size that is larger than the pest body, it is more effective than conventional insect nets indicating that it works on a different principle. Until now, the net color was not considered in product development because the general notion was that it is sufficient to make the mesh size small enough that pests cannot physically pass through. Therefore, conventional insect nets have been produced using mainly colors such as white, black, and blue out of convenience. However, if the mesh size is too small, there are trade-offs such as reduced exposure of crops to sunlight that results in lower yields, as well as reduced on that can lead to local environment deterioration due to higher temperatures and fungal infection9,10. In 2015, an interesting phenomenon was discovered in insect behavior. It was observed that thrips density decreases when crops are irradiated with red light (wavelength 650–750 nm), which is invisible to these pests11. At that time, this phenomenon was not expected to lead to a completely new pest control technology. However, as a result of improvements over the years12,13,14,15, we have succeeded in developing a new concept with insect nets that effectively prevents pest invasion and crop damage in cultivation facilities. Since the mesh size can be larger than the size of pests, it is also possible to increase light transmittance and reduce incidence of mold diseases such as powdery mildew. Onion thripsThrips tabaciLindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) are known to be one of the most important agricultural pests worldwide. It causes serious damage to Welsh onion, onion, persimmon, and citrus16in two ways. First,T. tabaciacts as a vector ofIris Yellow Spot Virus (IYSV) and TomatoSpotted Wilt Virus (TSWV)17,18. Second, it has developed strong resistance to the insecticides including pyrethroids19,20,21. Especially in the genotype of arrhenotokous, on which only a few insecticides remain to be effective in Japan22,23,24,25,26. In this study, we prepared three new types of red nets and examined the behavioral response ofT. tabaciagainst them in comparison with commercially available white/black nets. Next, we used them for the control of Welsh onion pests under field conditions. We present results showing that the red insect net can contribute significantly to labor-saving and sustainable agricultural production and discuss the potential of “optical pest control” based on the nature of insect color vision (Fig.1). (A) Red–white, red-red, and red–black nets used in the experiment. Red–white netwoven with red polyethylene thread in warp and transparent polyethylene thread in weft; Red-red net—woven with red polyethylene thread in both the warp and weft; and Red–black net: woven with red polyethylene thread in warp and black polyethylene thread in weft. (B) The reflectance spectra of nets used in the experiments. Among the 2.0 mm mesh nets, the red-white nets reduced thrips invasion into the net by one-third compared with the white nets, which was a significant difference (Fig.2A). In the case of the 1.0 mm mesh nets, the red-white nets reduced thrips invasion to about one-half of the white nets, but this difference was not significant (Fig.2A). In the 0.8 mm mesh nets, the red–black nets and the red-red nets significantly reduced thrips invasion to about 1/14 and 1/8, respectively, compared with the white nets (Fig.2A). The difference between the two red-containing nets and the white nets was statistically significant (Fig.2A). In addition, among the 2.0- and 1.0-mm mesh nets, the red-white nets produced fewer feeding marks than the white nets, but the difference was not significant (Fig.2B). On the other hand, in the 0.8 mm mesh nets, the number of feeding marks was reduced to about one-ninth to one-fourth in the red–black and red-red nets compared with the white nets, and difference between red–black and white nets was statistically significant (Fig.2B). In the analysis of the invasion rate and color of the yarn, the effects of the red yarn and the black yarn were significantly different from zero, and the absolute value of the coefficient was higher in the red yarn than in the black yarn (TableS2). (A) Comparison of the pest control effect of the six types of insect nets used againstThrips tabacifemale adults. There is a significant difference between samples designated with different letters (Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test using arcsine transformed values,p< 0.05). (B) Comparison of the effectiveness of the six types of insect nets in controlling the damage caused byThrips tabacifemale adults. There is a significant difference between samples designated with different letters (Steel–Dwass multiple comparison test,p< 0.05). The results of the thrips invasion experiments when two types of insect nets were placed together are shown in Fig.3A and their statistical analysis is shown in TableS3. As is clearly apparent, in all combinations of red-colored insect nets and black-white or white nets, the number of individuals entering the red-colored net was significantly lower. No significant differences were observed in any of the combinations of red-colored nets. In the combination of black-white and white nets, the number of individuals in the white net was significantly lower. Those results are summarized graphically in Fig.3Ba and in a simplified form in Fig.3Bb. From the charts in Fig.S2, the relationships “greater than” and “less than” in the choice probability of two-net-choice experiments can be summarized as RR, RW, RB < WW < BW. (A) Results of the thrips invasion experiments in which two types of insect nets were placed together. Asterisks indicate that the invasion rate is significantly different from 0.5 (Wald test,p< 0.05, Refer to TableS3); n.s.,  Not significant. (B) Summary of results of the two-net-choice experiments (Fig. 3A, TableS3). (a) Choice probabilities are represented with arrows that point from the net with a smaller probability of choice to the net with a larger probability of choice. Statistically significant probabilities of choice rates are represented as solid lines and not significant ones (n.s.) as dashed ones. (b) A simple visual representation of the relationships “greater than” and “less than”. Nets grouped by the dashed circle represent choice probabilities that are not significantly different from one another, or that their relationships “greater than” and “less than” are transitory. In addition, nets were sorted to avoid inconsistencies in the “greater than” and “less than.” Incidentally, this representation can be reworded in computer science terms27as follows: the graph (i.e., pair of nodes and directed edges) shown in Fig. 3B(a) is decomposed into its strongly connected components and topologically sorted as shown in Fig. 3B(b). In Trial 1,T. tabacioutbreaks in white nets and in the no net plots started on 5 July and their populations increased until 15 August (Fig.4A). In comparison, on 15 August, the adult and larval populations in the red-red net and red-white net plots were significantly reduced to about one-sixth and one-sixtieth, respectively, of those in the white net plots (Fig.4A). There was no significant difference in the adult and larval populations in red-red net and red-white net plots throughout the study period (Fig.4A). (A) The effect of red insect nets on the density ofThrips tabaciper 20 Welsh onion plants in Trial 1. Columns denoted by different letters are significantly different at the 5% level by Steel–Dwass multiple comparison test performed at each survey date. (B) The effect of red insect nets on IYSV infected leaf rate in Trial 1. Columns denoted by different letters are significantly different at the 5% level by Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test using arcsine transformed values from each survey date. With respect to leaf damage rate, there were significant differences between the red-red net and the red-white nets plots compared to the white net and the no net plots (Fig.S3). As can be seen in the figure, on 2 August the damage rate in the red-red net and the red-white net plots was reduced to about 1/21 and 1/9, respectively of that in the white net plots, respectively. Furthermore, in the red-red net and red-white net plots, chlorotic spots was not observed on Welsh onion leaves until 15 August, while leaves with IYSV disease were observed from 20 July in the untreated plot and from 2 August in the white net plots (Fig.4B). The leaf infection rate in the red-red net and red-white net plots was significantly lower than that in the white net plots on 15 August, about one-seventh and one-third lower, respectively (Fig.4B). In Trial 2,T. tabaciadult outbreak began on 3 July and the adult populations in full-, ceiling-, and sides-covering net plots on 1 August was significantly lower than in the no net plots (Fig.5A). Larvae were not observed in full-covering net plots during the survey period (Fig.5A). While there was no significant difference in the number of larvae among ceiling-covering, sides-covering, and no net plots, the larval populations in sides-covering plots were reduced to about one-tenth of that in the no net plot (Fig.5A).

Columns denoted by different letters are significantly different at the 5% level by Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test using arcsine transformed values from each survey date. The leaf damage rate in the full-covering net plots was significantly different from that in the no net plots throughout the trial period (Fig.S4). On the other hand, leaf damage rates in the ceiling- and sides-covering net plots remained higher than in the full-covering net plots, and significantly lower than in the no net plots on 14 August (Fig.S4). IYSV infected leaves were not observed in the full-covering net plots (Fig.5B). In ceiling- and sides-net plots, the leaf infection rate remained lower than in the no net plots, and on 14 August, it was significantly reduced to about one quarter and one third of the rate in the no net plots (Fig.5B). Insect nets are well-known for their use as one of the physical control techniques against thrips, whiteflies, and leaf miners in the cultivation of vegetables. The effect of insect net mesh size on pest invasion rate has been investigated, but the effect of net color has not been studied at all. Our results of the two nets choice experiments (Fig.3A) suggest that thrips visually discriminate nets containing red fibers (Fig.3B). The compound eye ofT. tabaciis thought to be comprised of three spectral types of photoreceptors: UV-sensitive, blue-sensitive, and green-sensitive28. Because the light environment in the laboratory does not include UV light, the photoreceptor sensitive to UV light is unlikely to be involved in the mechanism underlying the pest control effect of the red nets; blue and green-sensitive photoreceptors are likely to be involved. At wavelengths longer than 600 nm, spectral reflectance is higher in the red nets (red-red, RR; red-white, RW; and red–black, RB) than in the other nets (Fig.1B). Therefore, the pest controlling effect could be due to the long-wavelength component of the reflected light from the net stimulating the green photoreceptor cells in thrips. The pest control effect of other reported red light and materials on thrips11,15,29,30could also be explained by the blue- and green-sensitive photoreceptors as well, but further analyses are needed. Ohya et al.15have reported on the effectiveness of red nets in controlling insects. However, they found that the infestation-suppression effect of insect nets was enhanced by the color combination of the net threads. In this study, we selected the best combination of thread colors that suppress pest infestation and statistically proved the principle that red nets inhibit pest infestation. T. tabacihas several reproductive types, and arrhenotokous and thelytokous types have been identified in Japan19,31. Arrhenotokous types have developed resistance to synthetic pyrethroids8,23,24and the insecticide susceptibility of arrhenotokous is lower than that of thelytokous26. Thus, insecticide-independent pest control techniques are urgently needed. Red insecticidal nets can be a new physical control technology. SinceT. tabacimigrate onto the vegetable fields from the surrounding weeds, such asStellaria neglecta,Stellaria media var. procera,Lamium amplexicauleL., etc.16,32, putting up red-colored nets at the openings of greenhouses and around the fields can also significantly reduceT. tabaciinvasion. In this study, red-colored nets effectively kept the population ofT. tabacion leaves low, consistent with report in Ohya et al.15. In addition, we found a lower rate of leaf damage (Figs.S3andS4) and IYSV infection (Figs.4B and5B) due to suppression of thrips populations. The reduction in the infected leaf rate in the no net plots was likely due to the high rate of leaf damage caused byT. tabaci,and the fact that chlorotic spots are difficult to see in this situation and therefore missed. In Trial 2, insecticide was sprayed twice, and as a result the full-covering net plots produced Welsh onion with high commercial value by keeping the density ofT. tabaciinfestation lower than the other test plots (TableS4). By comparison, in the no net plots the density ofT. tabaciwas the highest among the four test plots, suggesting that at least twice as many insecticide applications are required to produce Welsh onion with high commercial value. The ceiling- and sides-covering plots also required at least one additional spraying compared to the full-net plots. From these results we conclude that the use of red-colored nets can reduce the number of insecticide applications in the field by 25–50%, making them a significant advancement in labor-saving and sustainable pest control technology. Welsh onion is infested with not onlyT. tabaci, but alsoFrankliniella occidentalis(Pergande)33andLiriomyza chinensis(Kato)34,35. Tomato, cucumber, and other vegetables grown in greenhouse in Japan are infested byF. occidentalis33,Frankliniella intonsa(Trybom)33,Bemisia tabaci(Gennadius)36,Trialeurodes vaporariorum(Westwood)37,Liriomyza sativaeBlanchard38, andLiriomyza trifolii(Burgess)39. Of these pests,F. occidentalis40,41,42,B. tabaci43,L. sativae44, andL. trifolii45have developed resistance to insecticides, and therefore non-insecticide techniques are required to control them. Our results reported here suggest that it is necessary to investigate the effect of red-colored nets on these pests in detail. The effects of light on crops have been reported to increase anthocyanin in apples46and promote fruit coloring in strawberries47. Shahak et al.48stated that the fruit weight and quality of peaches increased when covered with red-colored nets. The effect of red-colored nets on the growth and yield of Welsh onion is still unknown and needs to be investigated. In our laboratory experiments, red-colored nets with large meshes also suppressed theT. tabaciinvasion (Fig.2A) and showed that the red thread is significantly more effective in suppressing the pest infestation than white and black nets (TableS3). It has been pointed out that insect nets deteriorate the cultivation and working conditions by increasing the temperature inside the greenhouse due to reduced breathability9,10. Our results indicate that this problem could be solved using red-colored nets with a larger mesh. Further field trials using red-colored nets with larger meshes should be carried out. A laboratory population ofT. tabaciwas established from individuals that were collected from the fields of Welsh onions located in the Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture, on 4 August 2015. The laboratory culture was maintained on broad beans,Vicia faba, at 25 °C under a 15L–9D photoperiod regime, as described by Sogo et al.49and Aizawa et al.21. In the experiments, the following six types of colored insect nets were tested: a plain-woven insect net with red polyethylene yarn in the warp and transparent yarn in the weft with (0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mm mesh sizes; see red-white net in Fig.1A), net with red yarn in the warp and black yarn in the weft (only 0.8 mm mesh size; see red–black net in Fig.1A), net with red yarn in the warp and red yarn in the weft (only 0.8 mm mesh size; see red-red net in Fig.1A), net with black yarn in the warp and transparent yarn in the weft (0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mm mesh sizes; black–white net), net with black yarn in both warp and weft (only 0.8 mm mesh size; black and black net), and net with transparent yarn in both warp and weft (0.8, 1.0, and 2.0 mm mesh sizes; white net). Figure1B shows the spectral reflectance of each type of net measured with a spectrometer via optical fiber connected with an integrating sphere (HS1000S, Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd., Japan). The following experiments were conducted in the laboratory at 25 °C under a 15L–9D photoperiod regime. The skeletons of cylinders (150 mm dia., 250 mm high) for holding up the nets were made using wire and covered with one of the six types of colored insect nets described above. For controls, the skeletons were not covered with any type of net. One seedling of Welsh onion was planted in 200-ml plastic cups (100 mm dia., 45 mm high) containing vermiculite. Fourteen-day old potted plants (with two leaves each) were placed in each of the six types of colored net and set in a plastic ventilated cage (304 mm wide, 250 mm dia., 280 mm high) for 24 h. 20 female adults were then released into each ventilated cage. After another 24 h, the number of adults and the feeding marks (abrasion marks) on Welsh onion leaves were counted. The experiment was replicated 10 times. In addition, two each of the five types of 0.8 mm mesh colored insect nets (except black and black type), for a total of 10 test combinations, were selected and placed together 10 cm apart inside a plastic ventilated cage (304 mm wide, 250 mm dia., 280 mm high) with a 10 cm opening. One seedling of Welsh onion was placed inside the insect net, as in the above experiment. In the center of the plastic ventilated cage, 20 female adults were released. The number of adults on Welsh onion leaves was counted after 24 h. This experiment was replicated 6 times. Two experiments were conducted in a Welsh onion field at the Kyoto Prefectural Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Technology Center in Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture from June to August in 2016 (Trial 1) and in 2017 (Trial 2). The Welsh onion field was divided into four experimental plots (each 21.6 m2, 5.4 m X 4 m). For each of the three test plots, the entire surface of the greenhouse framework (4.0 m width, 5.4 m depth, 2.0 m height) was covered with 0.8 mm mesh red-white, red-red, or white-white types of insect net (Fig.S1). The control plot was not covered with insect net. This experiment was repeated twice. Welsh onion plants were planted on 15 June 2016. The cultivars planted were ‘Shinkujohosonegi’ and ‘Ryokusyu’ with plant and row spacing of 14 cm and 25 cm, respectively. In all test plots, no chemical insecticides were used during the study period. Plants were monitored once every two weeks, from 5 July to 15 August 2016. We counted the number ofT. tabaciindividuals and leaves damaged by thrips (except on 5 July) on 10 plants in each experimental plot. The numbers of leaves with necrotic spots by IYSV were also counted. Infection of IYSV was confirmed by DAS-ELISA when chlorotic spots were observed on the Welsh onion plants in each treatment. Leaves with chlorotic spots were counted as diseased leaves. As in Trial 1, the field was divided into four experimental plots (each 21.6 m2, 5.4 by 4 m): plot with only the framework (4.0 m width, 5.4 m depth, 2.0 m height) covered with 0.8 mm mesh red-red insecticidal netting; plot with only the ceiling covered; plot with only the sides covered, and plot not covered with any netting (Fig.S1). This experiment was replicated twice. Welsh onion plants were planted on 13 June 2017. The cultivars planted were ‘Taibyosobutori’. The plant and row spacing was the same as in 2016. Due to the high densities ofT. tabaciin the untreated area, all experimental plots were sprayed with spinetoram wettable powder on July 20, 2017, and with dinotefuran water-soluble powder on August 15, 2017. The surveys were conducted as in Trial 1, at approximately two-week intervals during the period of 3 July to 14 August 2017. All the experiments were performed in accordance with relevant institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. In the single-invasion experiments in the laboratory, the invasion rate through the insect nets was statistically analyzed by Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test using arcsine transformed values. For the number of feeding marks by thrips, Steel–Dwass multiple comparison test was used. The generalized linear model50was used to analyze the effect of the yarn color on the invasion rate. The invasion rate, r, was set as the dependent variable that is following the binomial distribution. Six types of nets were quantitively systematized based on the amount of red and black fibers that used to make them (SI Appendix, Fig.S2) and used as explanatory variables (TableS1). Logit function, Logit (r) = ln{r/(1–r)}, was used as the link function between invasion frequency and linear expression of explanatory variables. The significance of the regression coefficients was assessed by the Wald test. In the two-nets-choice experiments, the choice rate among the two nets was analyzed by the GLM as well. The choice rate c was set as the dependent variable that is following the binomial distribution. Only the intercept was used as the explanatory variable. The link function and the test of the significance of the intercept were the same as in the single-invasion experiments. In the field trials, thrips populations in each treatment were analyzed for both adults and larvae using the Steel–Dwass multiple comparison test. The rate of leaf damage by thrips and IYSV infection in each treatment were analyzed using the Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison test with arcsine transformed values. Statistical analyses in the multiple comparison were performed using Social Survey Research Information Co., Ltd., and analysis in the GLM was performed using R, which is the language and environment for statistical computing51.

Researchers experimented with the effect of red, white, black and combination-colored nets on deterring onion thrips from eating Kujo leeks, also called Welsh onions. In both lab and field tests, red nets were significantly better at deterring the insect than other colors. Also, in field tests, onion crops which were either partially or fully covered by red netting required 25-50% less insecticide than was needed for a totally uncovered field. Changing agricultural nets from black or white to red could help reduce pesticide use and the related negative impact it can have on the environment, while supporting more sustainable and effective agricultural practices.
Insect pests can be a nightmare for any gardener. No sooner do fresh buds appear then they are covered in aphids, beetles and other bugs looking for a tasty snack. While synthetic insecticides are widely used to control pests in gardens and on agricultural crops, many are known to cause damage to the natural environment by leaching into the soil and water supplies, and poisoning plants, wildlife and harmless insects. Some pests are also becoming resistant to the chemicals, so farmers are running out of options for what to use and needing to apply more often.
Agricultural nets are another way to protect crops and reduce insecticide use. You may see the typically white-, black- or blue-netted greenhouses when you pass by an orchard or vegetable field. Like a mosquito net over a bed, they physically prevent insects from getting to crops. It makes sense to think that the most important feature of these nets would be the size of the holes in the mesh. The smaller the hole, the smaller the insect has to be to enter. However, a research team from the Kyoto Prefectural Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Center and the University of Tokyo have found that the net’s color may act as an even more important deterrent.
“We tested red nets which had a mesh size that was larger than the insect body, but still more effective than other conventional black or white nets with a smaller mesh size. This ‘optical pest control’ relies on the nature of insect color vision to keep pests away,” explained Professor Masami Shimoda from the Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences at the University of Tokyo. “Most insects don’t have red photoreceptors in their eyes and it is difficult for them to see the color red, so we found it curious that an invisible color can be used to control them.”
The team focused on one pest, the onion thrips (Thrips tabaci). This insect is highly resistant to insecticides and causes extensive damage to a range of important crops worldwide, by eating them and by spreading harmful viruses. The researchers tested three color combinations of red nets (red-white, red-black and red-red) at three mesh sizes (2 millimeters, 1 mm and 0.8 mm). They also tested typical black, white and black-white combination nets of the same sizes, in the lab and in the field.
Overall, all nets which included red fibers performed significantly better at keeping out onion thrips than black or white nets. In the second outdoor trial, the researchers tested the effectiveness of red-red netting at different levels of cover: no cover, full cover, top only and side only. Due to an outbreak of onion thrips in the area, insecticide was used. The fully covered plot required the least amount of insecticide and produced onions of high commercial value. The plots which were only ceiling or side covered required one additional application of insecticide, compared to the fully covered plot. Compared to the completely uncovered plot, the red-netted plots overall reduced the number of insecticide applications needed by 25-50%.
“These new red nets are more expensive than pesticides, but they are economical because they can be used for years. They are also very effective in controlling pests without all the work involved in spraying pesticides,” said Shimoda. “My dream is that in future we can make red nets that don’t look red — at least not to the human eye, but they would have the same effect on pests. Hopefully, this would reduce manufacturing costs, and we can find ways to increase durability.”
As well as reducing infestation by onion thrips, another advantage of red nets is that because they rely on color and not mesh size, they can have larger holes. This improves breathability, reduces the chance of fungal infections and improves access to sunlight. Also, due to better airflow, temperatures don’t become as high within the greenhouse, making it easier for farmers working inside.
“If consumers are interested in this type of sustainable agriculture and using less chemical pesticide, I have no doubt that this simple yet effective solution will spread widely,” said Shimoda. “My family have been full-time farmers since the Edo period (17th century), and I myself enjoy growing vegetables and fruits on a small scale, although pests can make it challenging. Growing your own fruits and vegetables and eating them fresh is exceptionally worthwhile.”

Advertisement Molecular Psychiatryvolume29,pages1465–1477 (2024)Cite this article 6833Accesses 179Altmetric Metricsdetails Machine learning approaches using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) can be informative for disease classification, although their ability to predict psychosis is largely unknown. We created a model with individuals at CHR who developed psychosis later (CHR-PS+) from healthy controls (HCs) that can differentiate each other. We also evaluated whether we could distinguish CHR-PS+ individuals from those who did not develop psychosis later (CHR-PS-) and those with uncertain follow-up status (CHR-UNK). T1-weighted structural brain MRI scans from 1165 individuals at CHR (CHR-PS+,n= 144; CHR-PS-,n= 793; and CHR-UNK,n= 228), and 1029 HCs, were obtained from 21 sites. We used ComBat to harmonize measures of subcortical volume, cortical thickness and surface area data and corrected for non-linear effects of age and sex using a general additive model. CHR-PS+ (n= 120) and HC (n= 799) data from 20 sites served as a training dataset, which we used to build a classifier. The remaining samples were used external validation datasets to evaluate classifier performance (test, independent confirmatory, and independent group [CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK] datasets). The accuracy of the classifier on the training and independent confirmatory datasets was 85% and 73% respectively. Regional cortical surface area measures-including those from the right superior frontal, right superior temporal, and bilateral insular cortices strongly contributed to classifying CHR-PS+ from HC. CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK individuals were more likely to be classified as HC compared to CHR-PS+ (classification rate to HC: CHR-PS+, 30%; CHR-PS-, 73%; CHR-UNK, 80%). We used multisite sMRI to train a classifier to predict psychosis onset in CHR individuals, and it showed promise predicting CHR-PS+ in an independent sample. The results suggest that when considering adolescent brain development, baseline MRI scans for CHR individuals may be helpful to identify their prognosis. Future prospective studies are required about whether the classifier could be actually helpful in the clinical settings. The clinical high risk (CHR) paradigm is widely used with the goal of improving early detection of and prevention of psychotic disorders [1]. Individuals are considered at CHR for psychosis if they meet criteria for attenuated positive symptom syndrome (APSS), brief intermittent (limited) psychotic syndrome (BLIPS), and/or genetic risk and deterioration syndrome (GRDS) based on semistructured interviews [2,3,4,5]. The CHR state is present in 1.7% of the general population and 19.2% of clinical samples [6]. CHR individuals have a higher risk of developing psychosis (0.15 at 1 year) comparing to healthy controls, the transition risk increased from 0.09 at half years to 0.27 at 4 years [7]. However, most CHR subjects who do not transition to psychosis will continue to meet CHR criteria or experience attenuated psychosis symptoms at follow-up and only 33% will eventually remit [7,8]. The CHR state, is also associated with alterations in proxy measures of brain structure [9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. Previous structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reported a progressive decrease in gray matter volume in the medial and superior temporal and medial frontal cortex during the transition period among CHR individuals [14,15,16,17]. Gray matter volume continued to decrease several years after disease onset [15,16,18]. Cortical surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT), which can be extracted using FreeSurfer software [19,20,21], are also crucial predictors of important life outcome [22] and associated with neurological, psychological, and behavioral traits [23]. SA is strongly correlated with grey matter volume compared to CT, suggesting SA and CT are unique structural features in the grey matter cortex [24,25]. Recent study indicated that the multivariate architectures with respect to the makeup of the genetic factors were distinct across cortical surface area and thickness [22]. This is in line with the radial unit hypothesis [26] that the expansion of cortical surface area is driven by the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, whereas numbers of neurogenetic division of these cells for thickness [23]. Widespread lower CT has also been identified in cross-sectional MRI data in individuals at CHR in a large-scale pooled analysis of the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) CHR Working Group [27]. Among these widespread alterations, frontal cortical and temporal regions (e.g., fusiform, superior temporal, and paracentral) have been relatively consistently associated with CHR status [9,10,11,28,29,30], with these regions also exhibiting lower CT in individuals with established schizophrenia [29]. In addition to regional changes, individuals with CHR, have showed greater neuroanatomical variability in global SA, CT, and subcortical volume compared to HC [31]. Furthermore, longitudinal studies have shown reductions of cortical thickness in the paracentral, superior temporal, and fusiform gyrus have been reported to be associated with psychosis conversion in those at CHR [13,14,32]. Recent work has indicated that whole-brain sMRI patterns of schizophrenia forecasted 2-year psychosocial impairments in individuals with CHR [33], suggesting that alterations in brain structure may predict real-life outcomes. Adolescent development is a crucial time window that is associated with brain-wide changes, including reductions in cortical thickness and volume [34,35]. Cortical characteristics such as gray matter volume, cortical surface area, and cortical thickness decline by about 10% during adolescence [36]. On the other hand, white matter volume was reported peaking in young adulthood [36]. Since the period from adolescence to early adulthood is a high risk time window for psychosis onset [32], age-related anatomical deviations from typically-occuring declines may hold valuable information to predict later psychosis conversion, especially in frontal and temporal regions that have been implicated in CHR [27,32,37,38,39] and schizophrenia [40,41,42,43,44,45]. Further, greater brain age deviations were found to be associated with a higher risk for psychosis over time [11,38]. Importantly, these results suggest that the adolescent brain development pattern of CHR individuals may differ from that of HCs. Indeed, the ENIGMA CHR Working Group has reported that CHR compared to HC participants exhibit altered non-linear age associations with cortical thickness [27], suggesting that cross-sectional between-group differences in sMRI metrics may involve altered adolescent development, trait characteristics associated with psychosis liability, and/or progressive brain pathology around the onset of psychosis [32,39,46]. An increasing number of studies have attempted to use (cross-sectional) sMRI data to predict outcome or case-control status. These prior studies show that machine learning approaches are informative for differentiating individuals with schizophrenia from HCs [47,48,49,50,51,52]. Similar findings were observed in different clinical stages of psychosis, including first episode schizophrenia and CHR individuals [48,49]. A major limitation, however, is the need for large and diverse sample sizes to establish a well-tuned classifier that also provides generalized predictive performance [12,53]. Since single sites cannot typically provide the necessary sample sizes [49,54,55], multisite consortia data may be advantageous if site effects are adequately accounted for (e.g., via cross-site harmonization procedures) [49,54,56]. For example, without harmonization, a prior study failed to build a useful model with multi site data [38]. In the current study, we aimed to investigate whether cross-sectional sMRI data can be used to build a classifier to differentiate the neuroanatomical developmental patterns of HCs relative to participants who later developed a psychotic disorder (CHR-PS+) as biomarkers for future psychosis conversion. As altered developmental processes are implicated in psychosis risk, we considered the potential non-linear effects of age and sex to gain optimal predictive accuracy of trained classifiers. Here, we combined data from 21 sites harmonized through the ENIGMA CHR Working Group using ComBat [57] to minimize differences related to site-, scanner- and scanning protocols using an Empirical Bayes method. Second, to model non-linear age effects, we fitted generalized additive models (GAMs) [58,59] to the HC data, and then applied the fitted GAMs to obtain non-linear age- and sex-corrected features for the entire sample [60]. More specifically, we estimated the model in HCs and applied it to individuals at CHR to capture deviations from the expected patterns of physiological aging. As for patients with early-onset psychosis [61] and schizophrenia [41] have been reported to have abnormally low estimated intracranial volume (ICV), all procedures were performed after adjusting the MRI features for effects of ICV. Third, we developed an XGBoost [62] classifier using only HCs and CHR-PS+ to determine deviation in neuroanatomical developmental patterns as potential predictors of future psychosis conversion. Finally, we tested the predictive performance of the classifier with the left-out site data, to avoid the potential for information leakage between the training and test data. We hypothesized that CHR-PS+ individuals would be distinguishable from HCs based on features derived from structural MRI features, based on the assumption that those CHR individuals who are most likely to convert to psychosis would show the greatest baseline anatomical alterations. Second, we expected our classifier to label individuals at CHR who hadnotdeveloped a psychotic disorder (CHR-PS-) at follow-up, and individuals at CHR who did not complete follow-up visits, resulting in missing information about their transition status (CHR-UNK), as HCs. Third, we expected the classifiers to perform similarly in independent confirmatory datasets, and expected to find associations between classifications and symptom severity. We included data from a total of 1165 CHR individuals (144 CHR-PS+, 793 CHR-PS−, and 228 CHR-UNK individuals) and 1029 healthy controls (HCs) from 21 ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group sites (Table1). As previous study showed that using CHR psychometric instruments to assess the CHR state in clinical samples is associated with an excellent overall prognostic performance [63], we combined two assessments directly as previous studies [27,31,64]. CHR status was assessed using the full version of the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States (CAARMS [65];n= 650) or the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS [66,67];n= 799). Site-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, the available scale scores in premorbid IQ, symptom severity, global functioning, and antipsychotic use at scan are the same as in a prior publication (Supplementary TableS1) [27]. All sites obtained local institutional review board approval prior to data collection. Written informed consent was obtained from every participant, or from the participant’s guardian for participants younger than 18 years. All studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki [68]. We applied a two-step approach [49] to evaluate the performance of the models by dividing the data into four datasets: training, test, independent confirmatory, and independent group datasets (Fig.1). Test and independent confirmatory datasets were used as external validation datasets. First, the training and test datasets comprised the data from CHR-PS+ and HC from 20 sites except for Toyama, which was used as the independent confirmatory dataset. We chose this dataset because the Toyama site contributed the largest HC sample and excluding this dataset reduced sample imbalance between groups in building a machine learning classifier. Ninety percent of the data were randomly sorted as the training dataset, and the remaining 10% as the test dataset. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test did not show any significant differences between training and test datasets in any structural features. The independent confirmatory dataset comprised the data from HCs and CHRs at the Toyama site; this data was completely excluded from the training partition, and was used to perform an independent first-step evaluation without site information leakage. To evaluate the classifier on unseen new data, we defined the CHR-PS− and CHR-UNK individuals in all sites as the independent group dataset to perform the second step. HC healthy control, CHR clinical high risk for psychosis, CHR-PS+ individuals at CHR who developed psychosis later, CHR-PS- individuals at CHR who did not develop psychosis later, CHR-UNK individuals at CHR who could not follow up, SD standard deviation. Participating sites contributed to T1-weighted MRI brain scans from 31 MRI scanners, including 29 3-T scanners and 2 1.5-T scanners (Supplementary TableS2). Detailed scan protocols and the number of scans for each protocol are described in theSupplementary Materials. After processing the data using FreeSurfer analysis software at each site [19,20,21], we extracted structural features from 153 regions of interest (ROI) including 68 regional measures of cortical thickness, 68 surface area (SA), 16 subcortical volume, and one intracranial volume according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas [69]. We implemented the ENIGMA consortium quality assessment pipeline [40,41,70,71,72,73] and 8 samples were excluded for lacking 20% of the ROIs data. Remaining missing values (1.20%) were imputed using ak-Nearest Neighbor (k= 3) approach. ComBat [57] is a harmonization method used to remove scanner and protocol effects based on an adjusted general linear model harmonization method. Based on recent work demonstrating that neuroComBat harmonization increases statistical power within a mega-analytic framework, primary analyses were conducted within a mega-analysis framework using data that were corrected for site and scanner associations using neuroComBat harmonization [74]. Further analyses were conducted using Python version 3.7.12. We applied the extracted cortical thickness, surface area, subcortical volume, and intracranial volume measures with participants’ age and sex as covariates, along with protocol and site effects. To confirm that group status had no significant influence on the ComBat harmonization steps, we also conducted ComBat harmonization using the training dataset only (seeSupplementary Materials). First, we fitted a general linear model to regress out effects of intracranial volume. Next, we fitted GAMs to only the HC data to estimate non-linear effects of age and sex for every structural feature; then we applied the fitted GAMs to obtain non-linear age- and sex-corrected features. To verify the absence of information leakage and the stability of the GAMs, we also repeated this procedure 1000 times on randomly sub-sampled HC data to estimate the GAMs (seeSupplementary Materialsand Fig.S1). XGBoost is a scalable tree boosting algorithm [62]. We applied standardization for the structural features to building a classifier. The use of input data standardization, optimization of the hyperparameters of the classifier (eta, min_child_weight, max_depth, subsample, colsample_bytree) were tuned using GridSearchCV implemented in the ‘scikit-learn’ module (version 1.0.2) in Python (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_1_0_0.html) [75]. We plotted the weights of the classifier to determine the importance of the features for generalization. The classifier was optimized using a tenfold cross-validated grid search over a defined parameter grid. Data from the HC group were randomly downsampled to the same sample size as the CHR-PS+ group in each fold. To reduce downsampling bias, downsampling and grid search were repeated 1000 times and stratified tenfold for the training data. Then, we applied tenfold cross-validation and 1000 permutations to evaluate the significance of the cross-validation scores of the model with the best hyperparameters for the training dataset. The best cross-validation accuracy score was averaged across 1000 repeats. Permutation tests were conducted by shuffling the labels in the training data, and the permutation-basedp-value was calculated [76]. The final model with the best hyperparameters was trained using the entire training dataset. Finally, the trained classifier was applied to the test set and the independent confirmatory dataset with the best parameters tuned by grid search. The predict probability was calculated by the trained classifier for each sample. Predict probability ranges from 0 to 1, with smaller values indicating more likely classification as CHR-PS+. The cut-off point for the predictive performance was set to 0.5. The predictive performance of the classifier was evaluated using an independent group dataset (CHR-PS− and CHR-UNK). We compared the classifiers built from four different feature sets: (i) only cortical thickness values, (ii) only surface area values, (iii) only subcortical volumes only, and (iv) all features. The classifier with the best predictive performance for the independent confirmatory dataset was used for subsequent analysis. First, the classifier was evaluated using the test, independent confirmatory, and independent group datasets by the given scores of the tuned classifier. We calculated the confusion matrix, macro, and weighted average accuracies to evaluate the classifier because the data used were imbalanced (seeSupplementary Materials) [49]. The predictive performance of the classifier was defined as its performance on unseen data (in the independent confirmatory/group datasets) and was assessed using standard evaluation metrics. Chi-squared tests were applied to the classified labels of the test, independent confirmatory, and independent group datasets. Since we conducted a total of 6 comparisons, a Bonferroni’s correction was applied to adjust for the multiple statistical comparisons (p< 0.05/6 = 0.008). Predict probabilities generated by the XGBoost classifier were also tested using a nonparametric analysis of variance for all samples. To confirm little difference in the predictive performance between the assessments of CHR state, we tested the difference of predict probabilities including SIPS or CAARMS as a covariate. We also tested the difference in the rates of individuals predicted as CHR-PS+ that were assessed by either SIPS or CAARMS using a Chi-squared test. A GAM was used to assess non-linear relationships between age and the predictive performance of the classifier. Moreover, we conducted 4 comparisons (HCs vs. CHR-PS+, CHR-PS+ vs. CHR-PS-, CHR-PS+ vs. CHR-UNK and CHR-PS+ vs. CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK) of the decision curve analysis [77,78,79] using ‘dcurves’ package (version 0.4.0) in R software to estimate the classifier as well. Net benefit was calculated across a range of threshold probabilities [80] in comparison to getting MRI measurements to get a prediction for all patients or no patients. As threshold probabilities were set up to 50% (i.e., chance level), net benefit = sensitivity × prevalence – (1 – specificity) × (1 – prevalence) × 50%. We tested the difference in the predictive performance with respect to sex and the existence of APSS, BLIPS, and GRDS usingttests (p< 0.05/3 = 0.016). Pearson’s correlation analyses were also conducted between standardized IQ and the predict probability. Bonferroni’s correction was applied to the subscores (p< 0.05/4 = 0.0125). To determine the relationship between the predict probability and symptom severity, Pearson’s correlation analyses were performed using the SIPS and CAARMS subscores for CHR-PS+, CHR-PS-, and CHR-UNK groups. We testedz-score normalized positive, negative and general subscores of the SIPS and CAARMS using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Bonferroni’s correction was applied to the SIPS or CAARMS subscores (for SIPS: positive, negative, disorganization and general symptoms,p< 0.05/4 = 0.0125; for CAARMS: positive symptoms, cognitive change, emotional disturbance, negative symptoms, behavioral change, motor/physical changes,p< 0.05/6 = 0.0083). To determine the potential effect of antipsychotic medication on the classification, we also tested the difference in predict probabilities between those with and without medication use for each CHR subgroup using at-test. A non-linear effect of age, sex, and age x sex interaction on SA was found in HCs, as shown in Fig.2. The classifier using only non-linear fitted SA features (i.e., fit to HCs, applied to all) obtained the best performance in differentiating HC and CHR-PS+ groups (Supplementary TableS3). For the SA model, the best cross-validation accuracy within the training dataset was 85% (± 0.00008). The permutation test showed that the classifier performed significantly better than chance level (50%,p< 0.001). The accuracies with the best estimator for the test and independent confirmatory datasets were 68% and 73% (Fig.3B), respectively. Regions with the top ten largest features weights were the superior temporal, insula, superior frontal, superior parietal, fusiform, isthmus of cingulate, parahippocampal gyri, and postcentral gyri to differentiate HC from CHR-PS+ groups (Fig.3A, Supplementary TableS3). For SA in the right superior temporal gyrus, which was the strongest contributing feature of the classifier, the ComBat harmonized feature showed no significant difference among the groups (p> 0.05), while ComBat harmonized and non-linear age- and sex-adjusted feature revealed a difference between CHR-PS+ and CHR-PS- (t= 2.137,p= 0.0327), and CHR-PS+ and CHR-UNK (t= 2.140,p= 0.0325; Fig.4).

For a confirmatory analysis, machine learning classifiers using 152 sMRI raw brain characteristics showed poorer performance compared to the corresponding age- and sex-adjusted machine learning classifiers (Supplementary Materials). We also tried to build classifiers to differentiate CHR from HCs or CHR-PS+ from CHR-PS-, however, those ones only showed approximate chance level (50%) accuracies. A chi-squared test showed a significant difference in the classified labels for the independent confirmatory, and independent group datasets, respectively (X2(1,n= 151) = 6.34,p= 0.012 andX2(1,n= 1021) = 4.39,p= 0.036). Further residual analysis showed that the HC group was significantly more likely to be classified as HCs than the CHR-PS+ group (73% vs. 30%,corrected p= 0.004, Fig.3B). For the independent group dataset, no difference between CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK groups was found (73% vs. 80%,corrected p= 0.029). For the overall sample, a chi-square test showed a significant difference in the classified labels between the four groups (X2(3, 1172) = 15.12,p= 0.002). Further residual analysis showed a significant difference in the classified labels between CHR-PS+ and the other three groups (Bonferroni corrected p’s< 0.05; Fig.3B). For the predict probability, an Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference between the four groups (H=278.86,p< 0.001). Post-hoc comparisons showed that CHR-PS+ group was different from all other groups and that the CHR-PS- group was in between CHR-PS+ and HC groups (HC > CHR-PS- > CHR-PS+), while the predict probability did not differ between CHR-UNK and HCs (CHR-UNK > CHR-PS- > CHR-PS+;Bonferroni corrected p’s < 0.05; Fig.3C). The difference changed little after controlling the methods of the CHR assessments as a covariate (CHR group:F(2, 1161) = 192.25,p< 0.001; Assessment method:F(1, 1161) = 0.00,p> 0.05), and CHR individuals predicted as CHR-PS+ did not differ between participants assessed with SIPS versus CAARMS,X2(1, 1449) = 2.59,p> 0.05; (Supplementary TableS4). Although the classifier was built according to the features after controlling for non-linear age effect, a GAM analysis demonstrated that the predict probability was associated with age (F= 11.33,p= 0.003), and differed between CHR-PS+ and HC (t= 20.72,p< 0.001), CHR-PS+ and CHR-PS- (t= 17.83,p< 0.001), and CHR-PS+ and CHR-UNK (t= 17.64,p< 0.001; Fig.3D). No significant age × group interaction was found in the predict probability. The estimated decision curve for all comparisons (HCs vs. CHR-PS+, CHR-PS+ vs. CHR-PS-, CHR-PS+ vs. CHR-UNK and CHR-PS+ vs. CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK) showed that in clinical setting, compared to MRI measurement for all patients or no MRIs at all, getting a prediction from current classifier/model leads to higher net benefit to discoverer transition of CHR (Fig.3E). We observed no effects of sex or APSS, BLIPS, or GRDS status, on the predict probability (p> 0.05). No significant correlations were found between standardized IQ and the predict probability for each group. No significant correlation was found between symptom severity scores and predict probability. No significant difference was found for the antipsychotics use was found among each CHR group (p> 0.05). To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the one of a few to apply a machine learning approach to discriminate HC and CHR-PS+ groups in a large multisite sample [12]. To evaluate the classifier, we employed a two-step approach using an independent confirmatory dataset, obtained at a different site and using a different protocol from the ones used to build the classifier; we also used an independent group dataset including CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK groups. Although previous study reported 94% accuracy [12], we have achieved 85% accuracy in the 2-class classification in the training dataset using non-linear adjustment of SA features for age and sex. The patterns of neuroanatomical alterations were also useful in identifying CHR-PS- individuals. Specially, of the CHR groups, the CHR-UNK group was the most likely to be classified as HC by the classifier, than those in other CHR groups, showing no difference in the predict probability from HC. In this study, we were able to differentiate HC from CHR-PS+ group with 85% and 68% accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. The performance accuracy achieved by the classifier on the independent confirmatory dataset was 73%. In contrast to prior studies [12,38,53], we successfully built a model with promising predictive performance for new data. Our findings suggest that ComBat is not only useful to increase statistical power [55,57,74] but also crucial for improving the accuracy in building a machine learning model out of multisite data. As expected, the majority of CHR-PS- and CHR-UNK individuals were classified as HCs. Moreover, no significant associations were found between the predict probability and sex or IQ, or antipsychotics use for each CHR group. We suggest that a machine learning classifier trained to identify differences between CHR-PS+ and healthy controls may be helpful to identify UHR individuals at risk for conversion. In line with prior studies of cortical alterations in CHR [11,37,38,39,43], we found that the pattern of SA features, including the superior temporal, insula, superior frontal, superior parietal, fusiform, isthmus of cingulate, and parahippocampal gyri, contributed to identifying CHR-PS+ from HCs (Fig.2A, Fig.4). These findings align with previous work reporting (right) superior temporal gyrus functional alterations may underlie deficits in (non-)emotional multisensory integration in schizophrenia patients [81] and working memory-related dysfunction in CHR [82]. CHR individuals who converted or presented with greater clinical symptom within a 2-year follow-up exhibited smaller SA in the rostral anterior cingulate, lateral and medial prefrontal regions, and parahippocampal gyrus [11]. SA is more closely related to volume than cortical thickness [24], and the volume of the isthmus of cingulate gyrus has been reported to be different in resilient and non-resilient CHR individuals [39]. The neuroanatomical alteration/ deviance pattern of SA found in the current study between HCs and CHR-PS+ groups are consistent with findings from other studies, which implicate the volume of superior temporal, frontal and fusiform regions in CHR transitions [27,38] and schizophrenia [29,41,42]. Our initial ENIGMA CHR study showed the differences mainly in CT, and for two regions (i.e., the paracentral lobule and fusiform gyrus), the non-linear pattern of the age trajectory differed between HC and CHR [27,83]. However, the former study was focused on the statistical significance, and the current study is focused on predictive performance. As traditional significance approaches do not capture predictive variable sets [84], resulting in SA serving better building a predictive model. It is possible that the current study engineered the features that made the differences in SA more prominent, by using GAM to estimate the brain age gap in a non-linear manner. Moreover, as the result of GAM eliminating the non-linear adolescent development of SA in differentiating HCs and CHR-PS+, our classifier achieved promising generalization of predictive performance. Although we did not find any difference in predict probability between APSS, BLIPS, or GRDS status, it is important to note that previous studies demonstrated CHR subgroup-specific changes in sMRI metrics [85], such as subcortical volume reductions in left anterior frontal, right caudate, right hippocampus, and amygdala in CHR with a genetic risk, while CHR with attenuated psychotic symptoms exhibited right middle temporal cortical reduction [86]. Moreover, studies have shown that transition rates may differ between CHR subgroups [87]. These findings underscore the importance of using adequate sampling of CHR participants across subgroups and different clinical stages. Such efforts may result in more accurate predictive models in the future. The predict probability given by the classifier based on the neuroanatomical deviance showed significant differences among the HC or CHR-UNK, CHR-PS-, and CHR-PS+ groups at baseline (HC, CHR-UNK > CHR-PS- > CHR-PS+; Fig.3C). The results suggest that predict probability is a useful index allowing us to better understand how neuroanatomical deviance is associated with psychosis conversion. This further implies that the neuroanatomical deviance was already observed at baseline in CHR-PS+ group. Moreover, in contrast to previous working reporting a positive association between age conversion rates [83], our observed association between predict probability and age (Fig.3D) could suggest that the likelihood of a HC prediction increases with age. One possibility for this finding is the distribution of age across groups. Specifically, participants older than 30 years old were sparsely distributed in all groups in the current study, which may result in spurious associations between age and predict probability. To understand the exact nature of the association between age and predict probability, more data of CHR participants of older ages is necessary. These results suggest that psychosis-related brain characteristics may decrease according to brain development which may effect on the onset of psychosis. Our study has several limitations. First, to harmonize site effects, ComBat was applied to both HC and CHR subjects which by assuming a common covariate model (that is typically preserved by ComBat) might potentially lead to an information leak [88]. However, without traveling subject harmonization, ComBat was considered the most appropriate method for testing a classifier on individual samples from multi-site datasets [41,42,43]. Second, we could not test the effect of psychosis-by-age interaction on the predict probability as longitudinal MRI data were not available. Longitudinally tracking neuroanatomical changes around the onset of psychosis would offer more detailed information to understand the progressive brain pathology. Third, substance use of cannabis or alcohol was not available for the current study which is reported associated with increased risk of developing depression in young adulthood [89]. Fourth, while we note that a classifier that can distinguish between CHR-PS+ and CHR-PS- status is clinically useful, we did not explicitly train our classifier to distinguish between CHR-PS+ and CHR-PS-. Previous work suggests that the magnitude of differences in MRI metrics between CHR-PS+ and CHR-PS- are small. Although there exist no well-validated methods to decide on the minimal sample size to create a reliable classifier, considering these subtle differences, the sample size of CHR-PS+ may likely be insufficient. Increased availability of CHR data may enable the development of such a classifier in the future. In conclusion, we successfully trained a 2-class XGBoost classifier (HC versus CHR-PS+) and showed promising predictive performance on a multi-site dataset after considering age and sex differences. This classifier successfully identified 73% of CHR-PS- individuals as HC, and further 80% of CHR individuals who were not follow-up for the onset. These results suggest that when considering adolescent brain development, baseline MRI scans for CHR individuals may be helpful to identify their prognosis. Especially, the superior temporal, insula, superior frontal areas contributed most in differentiating CHR-PS+ from HCs. In light previous work reporting that alterations in these regions have implicated in psychosis onset, these areas could be informative in improving understanding of pathophysiology linked to psychosis onset. Future prospective studies are required about what and how the psychosis-related brain characteristics change according to the adolescent development, and whether the classifier could be helpful in the clinical settings.

An international consortium including researchers from the University of Tokyo, used the classifier to compare scans from over 2,000 people from 21 global locations. About half of the participants had been identified as being clinically at high risk of developing psychosis. Using training data, the classifier was 85% accurate at differentiating between people who were not at risk and those who later experienced overt psychotic symptoms. Using new data, it was 73% accurate. This tool could be helpful in future clinical settings, as while most people who experience psychosis make a full recovery, earlier intervention typically leads to better outcomes with less negative impact on people’s lives.
Anyone might experience a psychotic episode, which commonly involves delusions, hallucinations or disorganized thinking. There is no single cause, but it can be triggered by illness or injury, trauma, drug or alcohol use, medication, or a genetic predisposition. Although it can be scary or unsettling, psychosis is treatable and most people recover. As the most common age for a first episode is during adolescence or early adulthood, when the brain and body are undergoing a lot of change, it can be difficult to identify young people in need of help.
“At most only 30% of clinical high-risk individuals later have overt psychotic symptoms, while the remaining 70% do not,” explained Associate Professor Shinsuke Koike from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Tokyo. “Therefore, clinicians need help to identify those who will go on to have psychotic symptoms using not only subclinical signs, such as changes in thinking, behavior and emotions, but also some biological markers.”
The consortium of researchers have worked together to create a machine-learning tool which uses brain MRI scans to identify people at risk of psychosis before it starts. Previous studies using brain MRI have suggested that structural differences occur in the brain after the onset of psychosis. However, this is reportedly the first time that differences in the brains of those who are at very high risk but have not yet experienced psychosis have been identified.
The team from 21 different institutions in 15 different countries gathered a large and diverse group of adolescent and young adult participants. According to Koike, MRI research into psychotic disorders can be challenging because variations in brain development and in MRI machines make it difficult to get very accurate, comparable results. Also, with young people, it can be difficult to differentiate between changes that are taking place because of typical development and those due to mental illness.
“Different MRI models have different parameters which also influence the results,” explained Koike. “Just like with cameras, varied instruments and shooting specifications create different images of the same scene, in this case the participant’s brain. However, we were able to correct for these differences and create a classifier which is well tuned to predicting psychosis onset.”
The participants were divided into three groups of people at clinical high risk: those who later developed psychosis; those who didn’t develop psychosis; and people with uncertain follow-up status (1,165 people in total for all three groups), and a fourth group of healthy controls for comparison (1,029 people). Using the scans, the researchers trained a machine-learning algorithm to identify patterns in the brain anatomy of the participants. From these four groups, the researchers used the algorithm to classify participants into two main groups of interest: healthy controls and those at high risk who later developed overt psychotic symptoms.
In training, the tool was 85% accurate at classifying the results, while in the final test using new data it was 73% accurate at predicting which participants were at high risk of psychosis onset. Based on the results, the team considers that providing brain MRI scans for people identified as being at clinically high risk may be helpful for predicting future psychosis onset.
“We still have to test whether the classifier will work well for new sets of data. Since some of the software we used is best for a fixed data set, we need to build a classifier that can robustly classify MRIs from new sites and machines, a challenge which a national brain science project in Japan, called Brain/MINDS Beyond, is now taking on,” said Koike. “If we can do this successfully, we can create more robust classifiers for new data sets, which can then be applied to real-life and routine clinical settings.”

Advertisement Nature Communicationsvolume15, Article number:851(2024)Cite this article 8940Accesses 9Citations 97Altmetric Metricsdetails Owing to their remarkable properties, gold nanoparticles are applied in diverse fields, including catalysis, electronics, energy conversion and sensors. However, for catalytic applications of colloidal gold nanoparticles, the trade-off between their reactivity and stability is a significant concern. Here we report a universal approach for preparing stable and reactive colloidal small (~3 nm) gold nanoparticles by using multi-dentate polyoxometalates as protecting agents in non-polar solvents. These nanoparticles exhibit exceptional stability even under conditions of high concentration, long-term storage, heating and addition of bases. Moreover, they display excellent catalytic performance in various oxidation reactions of organic substrates using molecular oxygen as the sole oxidant. Our findings highlight the ability of inorganic multi-dentate ligands with structural stability and robust steric and electronic effects to confer stability and reactivity upon gold nanoparticles. This approach can be extended to prepare metal nanoparticles other than gold, enabling the design of novel nanomaterials with promising applications. Gold nanoparticles have been the subject of extensive investigation in recent decades because of their exceptional reactivity and broad applicability in various research fields, including catalysis, energy conversion, medicine, electronics, optics, magnetic materials and sensors1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Owing to their large surface area and abundant surface active sites, small gold nanoparticles exhibit high reactivity, which renders them particularly attractive for catalytic applications1,2,3,4,5,6. In this context, intense research attention has been devoted to the development of supported gold nanoparticles to address their inherent instability in past decades; however, the complexity in determining the reactive sites and the difficulty in realising fine-tuning catalysis are critical issues that appear during their applications1,2,3,4. Hence, exploring gold nanoparticles without supports, which are often called colloidal gold nanoparticles, has become an important avenue towards achieving distinct performance in fine-tuning catalysis2,3,5,9. To stabilise reactive gold nanoparticles in solutions, various chemicals have been employed as protecting agents, such as citric acid, alkanethiols, amines, surfactants and organic polymers (Supplementary Table1, Entries 1–12)9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. In particular, the introduction of the use of alkanethiols constituted an important breakthrough in the development of small (1–3 nm) gold nanoparticles with long-term (months) stability based on the strong affinity of alkanethiols to gold nanoparticles (Fig.1a)10,11. However, the stability of these gold nanoparticles comes at the expense of their reactivity due to reserved surface active sites and high ligand packing density, which hinder substrate access9,12,13. Meanwhile, although organic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are used to prepare gold nanoparticles that perform in alcohol oxidation reactions, their applicability in catalytic reactions requires further validation (Fig.1a)17. Another concern is that organic protecting agents can react under catalytic conditions, undergoing structural changes and/or detaching from gold nanoparticles during use, leading to destabilisation12,13,14,15,16. Therefore, the development of a universal methodology for obtaining stable colloidal gold nanoparticles while maintaining high reactivity for various catalytic reactions is an important yet challenging task. aRepresentative methods for the preparation of gold nanoparticles using thiol protection, organic polymer protection and polyoxometalate protection.bThis work: a non-polar-solvent-based multi-dentate polyoxometalate protection method for developing ultra-stable and highly reactive gold nanoparticle catalysts (TOA tetraoctylammonium). Metal oxide supports have occupied a central role in the field of metal nanoparticle catalysts owing to their ability to enhance the stability of gold and other metal nanoparticles, control their electronic states and achieve synergistic effects3,4,6,18. In this regard, polyoxometalates (POMs), a type of anionic metal oxide nanoclusters with diverse properties and functionalities19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26, have emerged as efficient protecting agents for stabilising metal nanoparticles by means of efficient coordination, electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance (Fig.1aand Supplementary Table1, Entries 13 − 24)27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37. In addition to an exceptional steric effect, owing to which bulky POM ligands only bind to a fraction of the metal surface, thus ensuring substrate access, the adaptable structures and properties of functional POM ligands enable a molecular-level catalyst design for achieving fine-tuning catalysis and synergistic effects33,34,35,36. However, POM-protected gold nanoparticles sometimes undergo agglomeration in solution during storage and/or usage31,32,36,37, which can be attributed to decomposition and structure transformation of POMs in the commonly used aqueous media or occupation of the vacant sites of POMs by alkali metal cations and solvent molecules, leading to destabilization of gold nanoparticles38,39,40,41. Moreover, the restriction to hydrophilic use besides the semi-stability issue of POM-protected gold nanoparticles has also limited the exploration of such a feasible molecular-level catalyst design towards practical catalytic applications32. Accordingly, we recently applied utilisation of POMs to design various metal oxo clusters and metal clusters in organic solvents, where we have shown that the above-mentioned troubles in aqueous media can be avoided42,43,44. Here we present a feasible method for obtaining ultra-stable and highly reactive small gold nanoparticles (of ~3 nm) by employing multi-dentate POM ligands in a non-polar solvent system (e.g. toluene, Fig.1b). Notably, the resultant small gold nanoparticles exhibit exceptional high stability in solution even under harsh conditions such as high concentration (>5 mM metal), long-term storing (>1 year), heating (~90 °C) and addition of bases (e.g. K2CO3and Cs2CO3), which are typically required in catalytic applications. These POM-stabilised gold nanoparticles exhibit high catalytic performance in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols with wide substrate scope and high selectivity to aldehyde or ketone products without changes in the particle size. Additionally, these colloidal gold nanoparticles are effective for various catalytic oxidation reactions using molecular oxygen (O2) as the sole oxidant. This methodology can be extended to various POM ligands, metals (e.g. platinum, ruthenium, rhenium and rhodium) and solvent systems (e.g.p-xylene and 1,2-dichloroethane) to produce small metal nanoparticles stabilised by multi-dentate POM ligands, which demonstrates its wide applicability and versatility. Gold nanoparticles protected by multi-dentate [SiW9O34]10−(SiW9) ligands in toluene (Au-TOASiW9) were prepared according to the following method (Fig.1b): first, separate aqueous solutions of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) and the sodium salt ofSiW9(NaSiW9) were prepared and transferred into toluene using tetraoctylammonium bromide (TOAB) as a phase transfer agent. Afterwards, an aqueous solution of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was slowly added to the resulting solution leading to a fast colour change in the toluene phase from orange to dark red (Supplementary Fig.1), followed by a phase separation process to yield toluene solution of Au-TOASiW9. A characteristic surface plasmon resonance band attributed to the gold nanoparticles of Au-TOASiW9was observed at 524 nm in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrum (Supplementary Fig.2). It should be noted that an excess amount of TOAB and a minimal amount of NaBH4are required; the former facilitates the transfer ofSiW9as ligands into the toluene phase until reaching the cation exchange equilibrium (Supplementary Fig.3) and the latter prevents the reverse transfer ofTOASiW9into the aqueous phase, in which 10 equivalents of TOAB and 4 equivalents of NaBH4relative to HAuCl4were found to be the optimal conditions (Supplementary Table2). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation of Au-TOASiW9indicated an average particle size (2.9 nm) comparable to that of dodecanethiol-protected gold nanoparticles (Au-dodecanethiol, 2.6 nm), which were synthesised via the classic Brust–Schiffrin method for comparative purposes (Fig.2a, e)10. Additionally, gold nanoparticles protected only by the surfactant TOAB (Au-TOAB, 2.5 nm) and fully occupied POM [SiW12O40]4−(Au-TOASiW12, 3.2 nm) were also prepared (Fig.2g, h).

Generally, colloidal gold nanoparticles suffer from stability issues such as concentration limitation due to the salting-out effect and agglomeration during use2,5,9,12. In contrast, this methodology allows employing metal precursors at concentrations exceeding 5 mM, which are significantly higher than those used in previously reported methods (Supplementary Table1, Entries 13 − 25). The stability of the small (~3 nm) gold nanoparticles prepared in this study was evaluated under long-term storage, heating treatment and addition of bases, which are general requirements for practical catalytic applications in solution1,2,3,4,5,6,12,13,14,15. Au-TOASiW9exhibited exceptional stability, retaining its particle size and size distribution during storage in toluene at room temperature (~25 °C) for over 1 year (Fig.2b). In contrast, Au-TOAB underwent agglomeration within 2 months (Supplementary Fig.4). Additionally, Au-TOASiW9displayed an extraordinary stability under heating conditions, maintaining its particle size after continuous stirring at 90 °C for 24 h, whereas the particle size of Au-dodecanethiol increased, and Au-TOAB and Au-TOASiW12agglomerated and precipitated under the same conditions (Fig.2c, f–h). Au-TOASiW9also showed strong resistance to the addition of bases such as Cs2CO3, whereas Au-TOAB and Au-dodecanethiol agglomerated and partially precipitated under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig.5). The precipitation of Au-dodecanethiol can be ascribed to the oxidation of thiol ligands to disulfides followed by detachment from the gold nanoparticles14, which highlights the stability issue of the ligands themselves during use. Notably, even after participating in catalytic aerobic alcohol oxidations in the presence of a base, Au-TOASiW9retained its particle size and size distribution (see Fig.2dand subsequent discussion). Taken together, these results indicate that Au-TOASiW9is much more stable than the well-known Au-dodecanethiol and exhibits resistance to heating and addition of bases, which are essential conditions in catalysis, and multi-dentate POM ligands are key for achieving high stability. To demonstrate the applicability and versatility of this practical approach, it was successfully expanded to other organic solvents, such asp-xylene and 1,2-dichloroethane, and to various types of POMs, including trivacantSiW9, fully occupiedSiW12, monovacant [SiW11O39]8−(SiW11) and divacant [SiW10O36]8−(SiW10), furnishing small (~3 nm) gold nanoparticles under similar synthetic conditions (Supplementary Fig.6). Furthermore, small nanoparticles (<5 nm) of different metals, including platinum, ruthenium, rhenium and rhodium were successfully synthesised (Supplementary Fig.7). Next, zeta potential measurements were performed to investigate the surface state of the gold nanoparticles (Fig.3a). The observed negative zeta potential for the POM-protected gold nanoparticles indicated the formation of anionic POM layers surrounding the gold nanoparticles31,32,33. Au-TOASiW9exhibited the most negative zeta potential, suggesting the strongest interparticle electrostatic repulsion that effectively prevents agglomeration. The aberration-corrected annular dark-field scanning TEM (ADF-STEM) images of Au-TOASiW9showed the presence of shells on the surface of the gold nanoparticles (Fig.3b, Supplementary Fig.8), and elemental mapping using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) further confirmed the formation of an Au-core–POM-shell-like structure (Fig.3c). Through titration experiments of dodecanethiol to Au-TOASiW9with inspiration by previous reports29,30, it was estimated that around 30SiW9ligands surrounded a 3 nm gold particle, and surface coverage can be estimated as 47% (Supplementary Fig.9, see explanation in detail). Subsequently, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the binding energy of the Au 4f7/2region of Au-TOASiW9(82.3 eV) was notably lower than that of bulk Au (84.0 eV) and Au-TOAB without POM protection (83.2 eV, Fig.3d, Supplementary Fig.10), indicating the anionic status of the POM-protected gold nanoparticles stemming from the electronic interaction between anionic POM ligands and gold nanoparticles31,32,33,34,35,36. Notably, the binding energy of Au-TOASiW9(82.3 eV) was even lower than those of reported anionic gold nanoparticles, PVP-protected gold nanoparticles (Au:PVP, 82.7 eV) andSiW11-protected gold nanoparticles (82.8 eV), which were obtained in aqueous solution17,33. No obvious difference in the binding energies was found between Au-TOASiW12and Au-TOAB, highlighting the importance of a robust electronic interaction between multi-dentate POM ligands and gold nanoparticles in this system. Moreover, POM-protected gold nanoparticles with similar particle sizes possessed sequentially modulated electronic states (Fig.3d), providing a feasible and effective tool for adjusting the activity of gold nanoparticle catalysts, as previously discussed in detail36. aZeta potential of Au-TOASiW9, Au-TOASiW10, Au-TOASiW11, Au-TOASiW12, Au-TOAB and Au-dodecanethiol in toluene.bRepresentative atomic-resolution annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) image of Au-TOASiW9.cEDS elemental mapping images of Au-TOASiW9.dXPS spectra of various ligand-protected gold nanoparticles and bulk Au (the arrow indicates the trend of changes in binding energy).eW L3-edge XANES spectra with associated second derivatives ofTOASiW9and Au-TOASiW9.fk3-Weighted W L3-edge EXAFS spectra ofTOASiW9and Au-TOASiW9.g, Relative energy ofSiW9-protected gold nanoparticles and models of the optimised structures for different orientations ofSiW9. To confirm the structures of the POM ligands after hybridisation with gold nanoparticles, solid samples ofTOASiW9and Au-TOASiW9obtained by evaporating the toluene solvent were characterised. Infra-red (IR) spectroscopies showed that Au-TOASiW9exhibited similar bands to those ofTOASiW9andNaSiW9regarding characteristic peaks in the region from 800 to 1000 cm−1, but differed from those of sodium tungstate, indicating that the structure ofSiW9was preserved (Supplementary Fig.11)34,36. According to Raman spectroscopies, the characteristic peak of W=Odbonding from POM structures was observed at 965 cm−1for Au-TOASiW9andTOASiW9, similar to that of the tetrabutylammonium salt ofSiW9(TBA4H6SiW9O34,TBASiW9) at 970 cm−1but slightly shifted from that of the sodium salt ofSiW9(Na10SiW9O34,NaSiW9) at 940 cm−1(Supplementary Fig.12). This can be ascribed to the presence of sodium cations near the POM anions in the case ofNaSiW9increasing the W=O bonding length and weakening the bonding strength45. To analyse the precise POM structure, X-ray absorption fine structure analyses were conducted. Similar patterns of Au-TOASiW9andTOASiW9in the second derivative of white-line region and W L3-edgek-space EXAFS spectra, indicating that POMs maintained their structures after hybridization with gold nanoparticles (Fig.3e, f)36,46. Then, similar patterns ofTOASiW9andNaSiW9but completely different from those of the potassium salt ofSiW12(K4SiW12O40,KSiW12) and WO3in the second derivative of white-line region indicated that there existed no obvious structural changes in the {WO6} octahedra (Supplementary Fig.13a, b). The W L3-edgek-space EXAFS spectra showed no significant changes betweenTOASiW9andNaSiW9while in contrast to that ofKSiW12and WO3, strongly indicating that POM maintained intact structures as well (Supplementary Fig.13c). In theR-space EXAFS spectra, the peaks atR= 1.2, 1.7 and 3.2 Å assignable to terminal W=O, bridging W−O−W and W−W, respectively, exhibited no drastic changes fromNaSiW9toTOASiW9, further supporting the preservation of POM structures in this method (Supplementary Fig.13d). Finally, structures of POMs during synthesis of gold nanoparticles were confirmed through deliberately transferring them into aqueous phase (Supplementary Fig.14, Supplementary Table2, Entry 5). In the IR spectra, the characteristic peaks ofSiW9in the region of 500 − 1000 cm−1were well consistent betweenNaSiW9and POMs after mixing with gold precursors and sodium borohydride respectively, indicating their intact structures in current method (Supplementary Fig.14). These results demonstrate that POM ligands remain stable in this synthetic system, effectively protecting the metal nanoparticles. The interaction betweenSiW9and gold nanoparticles was further investigated by performing first-principles calculations. Considering that the interaction of bulky tetraoctylammonium (TOA) cations and toluene solvent molecules with POMs was negligible, structural optimisations were conducted using one multi-dentateSiW9ligand with several different orientations on the surface of 2-nm-large gold nanoparticle without TOA cations and solvent molecules (Fig.3g). The most stable orientation was identified as that in which multi-dentateSiW9interacted with a gold nanoparticle at the vacant site ofSiW9. These results demonstrate that the coordination of gold nanoparticles at the vacant sites ofSiW9effectively contributes to the nanoparticle stabilisation and, together with the experimental results, highlighting the essential role of an adequate coordination of POM ligands in protecting metal nanoparticles during synthesis, storage and use. Hence, the development of ultra-stable small metal nanoparticles via POM protection was successfully achieved in a non-polar solvent for the first time (Fig.1b). The high concentration and extraordinary stability of the developed colloidal gold nanoparticles even under heating conditions and in the presence of bases prompted us to explore their performance in liquid-phase catalytic reactions. Anionic gold nanoparticles have been proved effective in activating O2, which renders them potential catalysts in aerobic oxidation reactions; however, only a few studies have been conducted so far17,33,36. Therefore, the low binding energy of the Au 4f7/2region of Au-TOASiW9motivated us to investigate the catalytic performance for various aerobic oxidation reactions in solution, particularly those requiring heating treatment or addition of bases, starting with aerobic alcohol oxidation as a typical model reaction of gold nanoparticle catalysts. Among the examined POM-protected gold nanoparticle catalysts, Au-TOASiW9exhibited the highest activity towards the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (1a) in the presence of K2CO3as a base to selectively furnish benzaldehyde (2a) as a product (Table1and Supplementary Table3). A sequentially modulated activity was found depending on the type of POM in line with the electronic states of gold nanoparticles, which can be correlated with the effective activation of O2on anionic gold nanoparticles (Table1, Entries 1–5; Fig.3dand Supplementary Fig.15). In contrast, gold nanoparticles including Au-TOASiW12, Au-TOAB and Au-dodecanethiol exhibited significantly low catalytic activity (Fig.1a; Table1, Entries 5–7). Notably, no significant changes were observed in the particle size of the gold nanoparticles protected withSiW9,SiW10andSiW11even after the reaction, and no significant decrease was observed in the catalytic activity of Au-TOASiW9during the reaction (Supplementary Figs.16and17). Furthermore, Raman spectra showed that Au-TOASiW9after the catalytic oxidation of1aexhibited similar characteristic bands with Au-TOASiW9, indicating that the structure ofSiW9was preserved (Supplementary Fig.12). In contrast, an evident agglomeration of gold nanoparticles was observed during the reaction using fully occupiedSiW12as a protecting ligand (Supplementary Fig17). These results indicated that the presence of vacant (coordination) sites in the POM ligands is essential for protecting the metal nanoparticles. Nevertheless, Au-TOAB underwent more severe agglomeration than Au-TOASiW12, indicating that POM ligands can generally function as stabilising agents in comparison to conventional organic substances31,32. Considering that the particle size of Au-dodecanethiol was kept after the reaction (Table1, Entry 7; Supplementary Fig.17), its low catalytic activity was likely due to difficulties in substrate access and strong bonding of thiol ligands to the surface of gold nanoparticles12,13. Meanwhile, Au-TOASiW9exhibited higher catalytic activity when using Cs2CO3as a base than in the presence of K2CO3, and2awas still selectively produced from1awhile maintaining the small particle size (Table1, Entry 2; Fig.2d). In contrast, the reaction barely proceeded using Au-dodecanethiol and Cs2CO3due to the oxidation of the thiol ligands, which led to precipitation of gold nanoparticles (Table1, Entry 8)14. Additionally,TOASiW9exhibited no activity and Au-TOASiW9did not promote the reaction under argon (Ar) atmosphere, confirming gold nanoparticles as the active sites and O2as the terminal oxidant in this catalysis (Table1, Entries 9 and 10). The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) was then examined for Au-TOASiW9-catalysed oxidation of1a. Under O2atmosphere (1 atm), a much higher reaction rate was observed for1athan benzyl-α,α-d2alcohol (kH/kD= 3.2, Supplementary Fig.18), indicating that C−H cleavage can be the turnover limiting step. When the reaction was carried out under air atmosphere (O2, 0.2 atm), no significant KIE was observed (kH/kD= 1.2, Supplementary Fig.19), suggesting that O2adsorption and/or activation can be turnover limiting step under air atmosphere (Supplementary Fig.15). To investigate the effect of cations, preparation of gold nanoparticles protected withSiW9was examined using different cations such as tetrahexylammonium (THA), tetradecylammonium (TDA), and cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA) instead of TOA. Although TDA can be used for preparation of gold nanoparticles, incomplete phase transfer was observed for THA and CTA owing to less hydrophobicity of metal precursors and emulsion formation, respectively (Supplementary Fig.20a). The obtained gold nanoparticles using TDA cations andSiW9(Au-TDASiW9) possessed similar particle sizes of 3 nm and similar catalytic reactivity to those of Au-TOASiW9, suggesting that countercations did not necessarily facilitate the reaction (Supplementary Fig.20b, c). These results provide direct evidence that multi-dentate POM ligands do not only contribute to stabilising the small (~3 nm) gold nanoparticles during their preparation but also allow retaining their catalytically active sites, enabling the modulation of the electronic states of gold nanoparticles for activity control. Furthermore, the Au-TOASiW9-catalysed reaction demonstrated a broad substrate scope, enabling the conversion of various primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding aldehyde and ketone products, respectively (Fig.4a, Supplementary Fig.21). When Cs2CO3was used as a base at room temperature (~25 °C), Au-TOASiW9efficiently promoted the oxidation of benzyl alcohol as well as benzylic alcohols with either electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups, affording the corresponding benzaldehydes (2a–2i). Au-TOASiW9successfully catalysed the oxidation of a heteroaromatic alcohol to the corresponding aldehyde (2j). In addition, an α,β-unsaturated alcohol afforded the corresponding α,β-unsaturated aldehyde (2k), and aromatic and aliphatic secondary alcohols also gave the corresponding ketones (2l–2q). aSubstrate scope of Au-TOASiW9-catalysed aerobic alcohol oxidation. Reaction conditions: alcohol (0.25 mmol), 3 mL toluene solution of Au-TOASiW9(Au: 4 mol%), Cs2CO3(0.5 mmol), ~25 °C (room temperature), O2(1 atm), 24 h.bSchematic of various aerobic oxidation reactions catalysed by Au-TOASiW9. Detailed reaction conditions are described in Method section. Finally, the applicability of Au-TOASiW9towards various oxidation reactions using O2as the sole oxidant was confirmed (Fig.4b, Supplementary Fig.22). In addition to the high reactivity and wide applicability in alcohol oxidation reactions, Au-TOASiW9catalysed the oxidative dehydrogenation ofN-methyl piperidone in toluene in the presence of Cs2CO3as a base (Supplementary Fig.23a). Subsequently, the cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reaction of a terminal alkyne and a hydrosilane in the presence of O2as the hydrogen acceptor efficiently proceeded using Au-TOASiW9to afford the desired alkynylsilane without formation of hydrosilylation products. In contrast, when the CDC reaction was performed under the same conditions using typical supported gold nanoparticle catalysts, the undesirable hydrosilylation reaction occurred to a certain extent (Supplementary Fig.23b)47. The observed high selectivity to the CDC product when using Au-TOASiW9can be attributed to a fast Au–hydride oxidation induced by activated oxygen species on the anionic gold nanoparticles preventing the hydrosilylation reaction. Moreover, in a regioselective alkynylation of a tertiary amine, Au-TOASiW9demonstrated comparable reactivity to the reported catalytic system using supported gold nanoparticles in the presence of ZnBr2(Supplementary Fig.22c)48. These findings demonstrate that this methodology provides a universal protocol for the preparation of colloidal metal nanoparticle catalysts simultaneously exhibiting high reactivity, stability and selectivity that can compete with conventional supported metal nanoparticle catalysts. In summary, we have developed a non-polar-solvent-based multi-dentate POM protection strategy for obtaining ultra-stable and catalytically active colloidal gold nanoparticles. These small gold nanoparticles exhibited remarkable tolerance towards high concentration conditions (>5 mM metal), long-term storage (>1 year), heating treatment (>90 °C) and addition of bases (e.g. Cs2CO3) without undergoing changes in particle size and size distribution. They exhibited a high reactivity and selectivity in various catalytic oxidation reactions using O2as the sole oxidant, including alcohol oxidation, piperidone dehydrogenation, terminal alkyne–hydrosilane cross-dehydrogenative coupling and tertiary amine alkynylation. The robust electronic and moderate steric effects of multi-dentate POM ligands are considered essential to achieve an extraordinary catalytic performance. The wide applicability to various POM ligands, solvent systems and metal nanoparticles, and the broad reaction scope render this approach highly promising for solving the compromise between reactivity and stability of metal-nanoparticle-based materials in diverse fields including catalysis, biochemistry, photochemistry, coordination chemistry, pharmaceuticals, physiochemistry and materials science. Gas chromatography (GC) analyses were conducted on Shimadzu GC2014 equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an InertCap-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) using Shimadzu CR8A Chromatopac Data Processor for area calculations. GC mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were performed by Shimadzu GCMS-QP2020 equipped with an InertCap-5 MS/NP capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) at an ionization voltage of 70 eV. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analyses were conducted by Shimadzu ICPS-8100. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations were conducted by JEM-2000EX and JEM-2010F at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations were conducted by JEM-ARM200F Thermal FE at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV and JEM-ARM300CF with a cold FE at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The illumination semi-angle and the collection semi-angle for atomic-resolution annular dark field (ADF-)STEM images were acquired 30 mrad and 32–200 mrad, respectively. W L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was carried out at the BL01B1 beamline of SPring-8. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were conducted in transmission mode using a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were analysed using xTunes programme49. Pre-edge backgrounds were subtracted using a McMaster equation. EXAFS backgrounds were subtracted using a cubic spline method (spline range = 5). W L3-edge EXAFS spectra ink-space were obtained ask3-weighted χ spectra after normalization. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on ULVAC-PHI PHI5000 VersaProbeIII at the Advanced Characterisation Nanotechnology Platform of The University of Tokyo. The samples were embedded in In foil and brought in the introduction chamber. The fitting of experimental data was conducted using a Multipak software (version 9.2.0.5, by Ulvac-phi, inc.) in which the Shirley method was used for the background and a Gauss−Lorentz type function was performed for fitting. The binding energies were calibrated by using the C 1 s signal of C−C bonding at 284.9 eV. Under these conditions, the Au 4f7/2signal of bulk Au (CAS No. 7440-57-5) was located at 84.0 eV. Solution-state ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectra were measured on JASCO V-770 spectrometer with a 1 cm quartz cell at room temperature (~25 °C). Zeta-potential measurement were conducted on Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS at a backscatter mode and a working voltage of 40 V was adopted. Infra-red (IR) spectra were measured on a JASCO FT/IR-4100 using the attenuated total reflection method. Raman spectra were measured on a JASCO NRS-5100. All chemical reagents were obtained from Tokyo Chemical Industry, Aldrich, Kanto Chemical, or FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical (reagent grade) without pretreatment. Inorganic salts ofSiW9,SiW10,SiW11,SiW12(NaSiW9, Na10SiW9O34; K8SiW10O36; K8SiW11O39; K4SiW12O40) and a tetrabutylammonium salt ofSiW9(TBASiW9, (C16H36N)4H6SiW9O34) were prepared according to the reported procedures40,50. Au-TOASiW9was prepared as follows: an aqueous solution of HAuCl4(20 mL, 5 mM) was mixed with a solution of TOAB in toluene (20 mL, 50 mM). The two-phase mixture was vigorously stirred until all the HAuCl4was transferred into the organic layer, and an aqueous solution ofNaSiW9(20 mL, 5 mM) was then added to the organic layer and the resulting solution was stirred for 30 min, followed by a phase-separation to yield the organic layer. A freshly prepared aqueous solution of NaBH4(20 mL, 20 mM) was slowly added, and the organic phase was immediately separated and filtrated twice using hydrophobic filters to remove residual water, affording a toluene solution of Au-TOASiW9. For optimization of TOAB and NaBH4usage (Supplementary Table2), the amounts ofNaSiW9and HAuCl4were hold constant, and the same procedures were used with the exception of varying the amounts of TOAB and NaBH4. Au-TOASiW10, Au-TOASiW11, Au-TOASiW12and Au-TOAB were prepared using similar procedures as that for Au-TOASiW9, except for using different POMs (K8SiW10O36, K8SiW11O39, K4SiW12O40) or no POM in the case of Au-TOAB. Gold nanoparticles in other organic solvents were prepared using the same procedures as described for Au-TOASiW9in toluene but usingp-xylene and 1,2-dichloroethane instead of toluene. POM-protected platinum, ruthenium and rhenium nanoparticles (Pt-TOASiW9, Ru-TOASiW9, Re-TOASiW9) were prepared as described above for Au-TOASiW9, except for using Na2PtCl6, K2RuCl5and K2ReCl6, respectively, instead of HAuCl4. POM-protected rhodium nanoparticles (Rh-TOASiW9) was prepared via a slightly modified methodology using RhCl3without conducting phase separation until NaBH4reduction was complete. Au-dodecanethiol was prepared according to the Brust–Schiffrin method10, except by decreasing the concentration for comparison in catalytic test as follows: an aqueous solution of HAuCl4(5 mL, 18 mM) was mixed with a solution of TOAB in toluene (20 mL, 20 mM). The two-phase mixture was vigorously stirred until all the HAuCl4was transferred into the organic layer, and dodecanethiol (0.9 mmol, 10 equivalents to Au) was then added to the organic phase. A freshly prepared aqueous solution of NaBH4(5 mL, 200 mM) was slowly added with vigorous stirring. After further stirring for 3 h, the organic phase was separated and filtrated twice using hydrophobic filters to remove residual water to give a toluene solution of Au-dodecanethiol, that was directly used without further treatment. UV–vis titration procedure, based on changes in SPR absorbance29,30, was used to quantify the replacement ofTOASiW9by thiolates on the surfaces of the gold nanoparticles. A toluene solution of dodecanethiol (5 mM) was gradually added to a toluene solution of Au-TOASiW9(0.5 mM Au), and the changes of the absorbance of SPR bands were monitored by UV–vis spectra. The temperature was maintained at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. The aerobic alcohol oxidation reaction was conducted as follows:1a(0.25 mmol), biphenyl as an internal standard (0.25 mmol), Au-TOASiW9(2 mL toluene solution containing 0.01 mmol Au), appended toluene for better dispersion of the base (1 mL) and a magnetic stirrer bar were added to a Pyrex glass reactor, which was then purged with O2gas and sealed with a screw cap. The solution was stirred at room temperature (~25 °C) for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, the substrate conversions and product yields were determined via GC analysis. For the reaction under Ar (1 atm), freeze-pump-thaw cycles were carried out and the reactor was connected to a balloon filled with an Ar gas. The oxidative dehydrogenation of piperidone was conducted as follows: 1-methyl-4-piperidone (0.25 mmol), biphenyl as an internal standard (0.25 mmol), Au-TOASiW9(5 mL toluene solution containing 0.025 mmol Au), and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar were added to a Pyrex glass reactor, which was purged with O2gas and then sealed with a screw cap. The solution was stirred at 70 °C for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, the substrate conversions and product yields were determined via GC analysis. The cross-dehydrogenative coupling reaction of a terminal alkyne and a hydrosilane was conducted as follows: ethynylbenzene (0.25 mmol), triethylsilane (0.3 mmol), biphenyl as an internal standard (0.25 mmol), Au-TOASiW9(2 mL toluene solution containing 0.01 mmol Au) and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar were added to a Pyrex glass reactor, which was purged with O2gas and sealed with a screw cap. The solution was stirred at 90 °C for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, the substrate conversions and product yields were determined via GC analysis. The regioselective alkynylation of a tertiary amine was conducted as follows: 1-methylpiperidine (0.5 mmol), ethynylbenzene (0.25 mmol), ZnBr2(0.25 mmol), biphenyl as an internal standard (0.25 mmol), Au-TOASiW9(2 mL toluene solution containing 0.01 mmol Au) and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar were added to a Pyrex glass reactor, which was then purged with O2and sealed with a screw cap. The solution was stirred at 90 °C for 24 h. After completion of the reaction, the substrate conversions and product yields were determined via GC analysis. First-principles density functional theory calculations were performed by using the CONQUEST code. Double-ζplus polarization pseudo atomic orbital (PAO) basis functions were used with norm-conserving pseudopotentials. 5 s and 5p semi-core PAOs were used for Au and W. The PAO ranges [bohr] are as follows: Au [5 s, 5p, 5d, 6 s, 6p] = [2.81, 3.36, (7.12, 3.74), (7.12, 3.74), 7.12], Si [3 s, 3p, 3d] = [(7.12, 4.02), (7.12, 4.02), 7.12], W [5 s, 5p, 6 s, 5d, 6p] = [3.22, 3.85, (7.97, 4.18), (7.97, 4.18), 7.97], and O [2 s, 2p, 3d] = [(4.91, 2.58), (4.91, 2.58), 4.91]. The PBE exchange-correlation functional was used. The geometry ofSiW9-protected Au nanoparticle (denoted as Au-SiW9) with different orientations was optimised, in which Au was modelled as a nanoparticle of diameter about 2 nm (consisting of 309 atoms) inOhsymmetry. According to the formal charge ofSiW9, we set the charge of the unit cell to be –10 for Au-SiW9with neutralizing background uniform charge density. The cubic unit cells of 75.6×75.6×75.6 bohr3were used for all systems. The grid spacing was 0.21 bohr.

The enhanced gold catalysts can withstand a greater range of physical environments compared to unprotected equivalent materials. This could increase their range of possible applications, as well as reduce energy consumption and costs in some situations. These catalysts are widely used throughout industrial settings, including chemical synthesis and production of medicines. These industries could benefit from improved gold catalysts.
Everybody loves gold: athletes, pirates, bankers — everybody. It’s historically been an attractive metal to craft things from, like medals, jewelry, coins and so on. The reason gold appears so shiny and alluring to us is because it’s chemically resilient to physical conditions that might otherwise tarnish other materials, for example, heat, pressure, oxidation and other detriments. Paradoxically, however, at nanoscopic scales, tiny particles of gold reverse this trend and become very reactive, so much so that for a long time now they have been essential to realize different kinds of catalysts, intermediary substances which accelerate or in some way enable a chemical reaction to take place. In other words, they’re useful or necessary to turn one substance into another, hence their widespread use in synthesis and manufacture.
“Gold is a wonderful metal and is rightly praised in society, and especially in science,” said Associate Professor Kosuke Suzuki from the Department of Applied Chemistry at the University of Tokyo. “It’s great for catalysts and can help us synthesize a range of things, including medicines. The reasons for this are that gold has a low affinity for absorbing molecules and is also highly selective about what it binds with, so it allows for very precise control of chemical synthesis processes. Gold catalysts often operate at lower temperatures and pressures compared to traditional catalysts, requiring less energy and reducing environmental impact.”
As good as gold is, though, it does have some drawbacks. It becomes more reactive the smaller particles are made of it, and there is a point at which a catalyst made with gold can begin to suffer negatively from heat, pressure, corrosion, oxidation and other conditions. Suzuki and his team thought they could improve upon this situation and devised a novel protective agent that could allow a gold catalyst to maintain its useful functions but across a greater range of physical conditions that usually hinder or destroy a typical gold catalyst.
“Current gold nanoparticles used in catalysts have some level of protection, thanks to agents such as dodecanethiols and organic polymers. But our new one is based on a cluster of metal oxides called polyoxometalates and it offers far superior results, especially in regard to oxidative stress,” said Suzuki. “We are currently investigating the novel structures and applications of polyoxometalates. This time we applied the polyoxometalates to gold nanoparticles and ascertained the polyoxometalates improve the nanoparticles’ durability. The real challenge was applying a wide range of analytical techniques to test and verify all this.”
The team used a variety of techniques collectively known as spectroscopy. It employed no less than six spectroscopic methods which vary in the kinds of information they reveal about a material and its behavior. But generally speaking, they work by casting some kind of light onto a substance and measuring how that light changes in some way with specialized sensors. Suzuki and his team spent months running various tests and different configurations of their experimental material until they found what they were seeking.
“We’re not just driven by trying to improve some methods of chemical synthesis. There are many applications of our enhanced gold nanoparticles that could be used to benefit society,” said Suzuki. “Catalysts to break down pollution (many gasoline cars already have a familiar catalytic converter), less impactful pesticides, green chemistry for renewable energy, medical interventions, sensors for foodborne pathogens, the list goes on. But we also want to go further. Our next steps will be to improve the range of physical conditions we can make gold nanoparticles more resilient to, and also see how we can add some durability to other useful catalytic metals like ruthenium, rhodium, rhenium and, of course, something people prize even more highly than gold: platinum.”

However, ACC glutamatergic changes in subjects at high-risk for psychosis, and the effects of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on glutamatergic function in adolescents remain unclear. In this study, adolescents recruited from the general population underwent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the pregenual ACC using a 3-Tesla scanner. We explored longitudinal data on the association of combined glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels, measured by MRS, with subclinical psychotic experiences. Moreover, we investigated associations of bullying victimization, a risk factor for subclinical psychotic experiences, and help-seeking intentions, a coping strategy against stressors including bullying victimization, with Glx levels. Finally, path analyses were conducted to explore multivariate associations. For a contrast analysis, gamma-aminobutyric acid plus macromolecule (GABA+) levels were also analyzed. Negative associations were found between Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences at both Times 1 (n= 219, mean age 11.5 y) and 2 (n= 211, mean age 13.6 y), as well as for over-time changes (n= 157, mean interval 2.0 y). Moreover, effects of bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction effects on Glx levels were found (n= 156). Specifically, bullying victimization decreased Glx levels, whereas help-seeking intention increased Glx levels only in bullied adolescents. Finally, associations among bullying victimization, help-seeking intention, Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences were revealed. GABA+ analysis revealed no significant results. This is the first adolescent study to reveal longitudinal trajectories of the association between glutamatergic function and subclinical psychotic experiences and to elucidate the effect of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on glutamatergic function. Our findings may deepen the understanding of how environmental emotional/social stressors induce impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission that could be the underpinning of liability for psychotic experiences in early adolescence. Schizophrenia is a major psychiatric disorder characterized by positive (hallucinations and delusions), negative (blunted affect, social withdrawal, and anhedonia), and cognitive symptoms. The two major theories for the pathology of schizophrenia are the dopamine hypothesis and the glutamate hypothesis. The dopamine hypothesis can explain the pathology of positive symptoms, because dopamine 2 (D2) receptor (D2DR) antagonists reduce the severity of positive symptoms. However, D2DR antagonists do not improve negative or cognitive symptoms. Since N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine, ketamine, and dizocilpine induce positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms, the glutamate hypothesis has been established [1,2]. The causes of NMDA receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia are thought to be varied, including reduced levels of co-agonists such as D-serine and glycine, increased antagonist levels, and reduced NMDA channel expression and trafficking [3]. In addition, it should be noted that, even if none of these possible causes exist, decreased synaptic levels of glutamate would theoretically result in receptor hypofunction because the NMDA receptor is a glutamate receptor. NMDA receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia spectrum disorders has been revealed by genetic [4,5], neuroimaging (e.g., magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy [MRS], positron emission tomography [PET], and single photon emission computed tomography) [6,7,8], neurophysiological (e.g., mismatch negativity) [9], postmortem [10,11], and animal studies [12,13]. In addition, glutamate modulating treatments for schizophrenia have been explored [14]. However, so far, there is limited support from neuroimaging studies including MRS for the hypothesis that glutamatergic abnormalities may be a major neural substrate of schizophrenia [2]. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role not only in higher cognitive function, including working memory and decision making [15,16], but also in adaptation to complexity and uncertainty [17]. Additionally, the ACC serves as part of the limbic system and is involved in emotional processing [18,19]. Furthermore, the ACC is involved in social cognition and sociality [20,21]. The ACC is subdivided into dorsal and ventral areas, which are mainly involved in cognitive function and emotional processing, respectively [22]. Psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, can impair various aspects of psychological function. Several previous MR imaging (MRI) studies have reported structural and functional changes in the ACC in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, including first-episode psychosis (FEP). For example, a meta-analytic study revealed that gray matter volume decreased in the dorsal and ventral ACC in FEP [23]. In addition, a meta-analytic resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) study reported the default mode network’s within-network hypoconnectivity, including the ventral ACC, in FEP [24]. As for high-risk for psychosis, less cortical gray matter in the ACC was found in individuals at clinical high-risk who later transitioned to psychosis [25]. According to a recent fMRI study, ACC functional connectome is implicated in clinical high risk for psychosis [26]. Several recent MRS meta-analytic studies have reported decreases or increases in ACC glutamate levels in schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and the change direction seems to differ according to clinical staging. Glutamate and combined glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels in the medial frontal cortex and ACC are lower in schizophrenia [27] and glutamate levels in the dorsal ACC are lower in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia [28], whereas Glx and glutamate levels in the dorsal ACC are higher in treatment-resistant schizophrenia [28]. This discrepancy based on different treatment responses may be linked to the finding from a recent meta-analysis that higher-than-normal glutamate variability in patients with schizophrenia is likely to be found in older subjects [29]. In addition, higher Glx levels in the dorsal ACC and structural changes, such as lower cortical thickness and higher mean diffusivity, in some ACC components were associated in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia [30]. The results of ACC glutamatergic levels in FEP were controversial until several years ago [31], whereas recent 7-tesla MRS studies revealed lower glutamate levels in the dorsal ACC in patients with FEP [32,33]. Some meta-analytic studies reported higher frontal and ACC Glx levels in individuals who are at increased genetic [7] or clinical risk of developing psychosis [34], while another meta-analytic study revealed no significant changes in frontal glutamate or Glx levels in clinical high-risk or genetically high-risk groups [35]. As for associations of glutamatergic function with clinical characteristics, Griffiths et al. reported that ACC glutamate and Glx levels were positively associated with memory function in patients with schizophrenia [36]. Another recent study reported that dorsal ACC Glx levels were negatively associated with psychotic symptoms and positively associated with spatial executive function in ultra-high-risk patients [37]. Demro et al. revealed a positive correlation between ACC glutamate levels and grandiosity in adolescents at increased clinical risk for psychosis [38]. In summary, while results regarding ACC glutamate alterations in individuals at high-risk for psychosis are not yet completely conclusive and patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia demonstrate higher glutamate levels in the dorsal ACC, ACC glutamate levels are lower-than-normal and lower glutamate levels are associated with more severe clinical symptoms and lower cognitive function in other clinical stages of schizophrenia spectrum disorders including non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia and FEP. It is important to consider how these findings are associated with the NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis. A recent MRS study reported no acute effects of ketamine administration on ACC Glx levels in healthy subjects [39]. Some previous studies suggested elevated glutamate levels following NMDA receptor hypofunction (e.g., ketamine-evoked glutamate elevation in mice hippocampus) [40]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no direct evidence of increased ACC glutamate levels induced by NMDA receptor hypofunction. As mentioned above, a pre-existing decrease in synaptic glutamate levels could theoretically result in NMDA receptor hypofunction. Thus, we assume that the lower-than-normal levels of ACC glutamate found in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia and FEP should be in favor of the glutamate hypothesis. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that lower ACC Glx levels may be related to psychotic characteristics at an early stage of psychotic disorder. The associations between longitudinal changes in psychotic symptoms and those in ACC glutamatergic function in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are almost unknown so far. Some recent longitudinal MRS studies have explored changes in ACC glutamatergic levels over antipsychotic treatment periods [41,42,43], but they reached different conclusions. For example, Bojesen et al. reported a lower glutamate-to-creatine ratio in the dorsal ACC in antipsychotic-naïve patients with FEP both at baseline and after antipsychotic treatment [43]. In addition, some studies reported different glutamatergic levels over antipsychotic treatment periods between ACC and another region [43]. Kubota et al. conducted a meta-analysis and reported decreased frontal Glx levels after treatment in patients with schizophrenia [44]. The different results across studies may be because of differences in brain regions of interest, in antipsychotic compounds used at baseline and during treatment, and in stages of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. To the best of our knowledge, there is no medium- or large-scale longitudinal study of ACC glutamatergic function in subjects at high-risk for psychosis, despite there being a previous small-scale study [45]. In addition, there is no longitudinal study of the association between psychotic symptoms and ACC glutamatergic function in subjects who keep antipsychotic-naïve throughout the studied period. Subclinical psychotic experiences, also called psychotic-like experiences, can be found in the general population as a subthreshold phenotype, implying an underlying continuum of psychosis from subclinical to clinical levels. Longitudinal birth cohort studies have revealed that subclinical psychotic experiences in early adolescence are a risk factor for the later onset of schizophrenia [46]. Fisher et al. reported that children with psychotic symptoms at age 11 were at an elevated risk of developing schizophrenia by age 38 (relative risk 7.24) when compared to those without [47]. In addition, according to Zammit et al., the risk of psychotic disorders even at age 18 was greater in those with suspected as well as definite psychotic experiences at age 12 [48], suggesting that subclinical psychotic experiences in early adolescence can be representative to psychotic experiences around the time of the first episode. Furthermore, a recent study on data from Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development℠ study reported that early adolescents with persistent distressing subclinical psychotic experiences were likely to show large psychopathological and cognitive impairment [49]. Although a previous meta-analysis showed a 5% prevalence rate of subclinical psychotic experiences in the general population [50], the rate of subclinical psychotic experiences may be much higher among early adolescents. According to Kelleher et al., psychotic symptoms were reported by 21% of the early adolescents (ages 11–13 years) and 7% of the mid-adolescents (ages 13–16 years) [51]. Thus, it is rational to focus on subclinical psychotic experiences in a general early adolescent population. However, as far as we know, no previous study has explored the association between ACC glutamatergic levels and subclinical psychotic experiences in early adolescents. Early life stress is a risk factor for schizophrenia onset. Increased emotional and social stress is associated with psychosis and subclinical psychotic experiences [52]. Bullying is a major social problem affecting adolescents all over the world. Being bullied in adolescence is associated with adverse mental health outcomes including psychotic symptoms [53,54]. On the other hand, help-seeking behavior of adolescent bullied victims has a positive effect on their outcomes, which means that help-seeking is a protective coping strategy against stressors such as being bullied [55,56]. However, it remains unclear how environmental emotional/social stressors biologically cause subclinical psychotic experiences in adolescents. Previous studies reported associations between stress-related factors and ACC glutamatergic function. Ho et al. reported a positive correlation in depressed adolescents between dorsal ACC glutamate levels and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, that may be induced by psychological stress [57]. Naismith et al. revealed a positive correlation in young adults with affective disorders between ventral ACC Glx levels and delayed circadian phase, which may be related to psychological distress [58]. Other previous studies reported associations between environmental emotional/social stressors and ACC glutamatergic function. Ventral ACC glutamatergic levels are lower-than-normal in youths traumatized by a natural disaster [59] and a terror attack [60], which are rare but not common environmental stressors. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has explored the effects of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on ACC glutamatergic function in human adolescents. In addition, no previous study has explored its moderating effects of a help-seeking strategy, while the effect of a help-seeking strategy may be different with and without stressors. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized from glutamate by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). GABA functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, while glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter. GABAergic neurons, including parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, orchestrate gamma-band oscillation [61], contributing to higher cognitive function. Expression of GAD67 messenger ribonucleic acid and other GABA-related transcripts is decreased in the postmortem ACC of patients with schizophrenia [62,63,64]. Recent MRS meta-analytic studies indicate lower-than-normal GABA levels in the dorsal ACC but not the ventral ACC in schizophrenia [65] and FEP [28]. Additionally, GABA levels are reported as normal in the ventral ACC in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis [65]. However, as far as we know, no previous study has investigated the association between ACC GABA levels and subclinical psychotic experiences in early adolescents. Previous MRS studies explored associations of psychological stressors with ACC GABA levels in adults, but the results were inconclusive [66,67,68,69]. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of exploration into the effects of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on ACC GABAergic function in early adolescents. In this context, we hypothesized an association over time between ACC glutamatergic levels and subclinical psychotic experiences in the general adolescent population. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the association of these two variables should be consistent over time and that the association between differences over time in these two variables should be present. In addition, we hypothesized an effect of bullying victimization on ACC glutamatergic levels and its moderating effect of help-seeking intentions in the general adolescent population. We thought that the ventral (pregenual) ACC was a better region to focus on compared to the dorsal ACC to test our hypotheses. This was because both being bullied and having psychotic experiences, especially the former, are related to emotional dysregulation [22,70], and because several previous neuroimaging studies reported the roles of the ventral ACC both in psychosis [71,72,73] and in emotional social stress [74,75,76]. Thus, in this study, we explored the association of pregenual ACC glutamate levels with subclinical psychotic experiences over time using a two-time-point longitudinal dataset with more than 200 adolescents recruited from the Tokyo TEEN Cohort (TTC) study [77,78]. We measured pregenual ACC Glx levels using MRS technique. Additionally, we investigated the association between emotionally and socially stressful events and glutamatergic function. Specifically, we explored the effects of bullying victimization as well as of help-seeking intentions on pregenual ACC Glx levels. For a contrast analysis, GABA levels were also analyzed under our hypothesis that there is no association of GABAergic function in the pregenual ACC with subclinical psychotic experiences or bullying victimization/help-seeking intentions in the early adolescents. We expected this study to elucidate neural substrates of adolescent psychotic experiences according to the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. This study was conducted as part of the population-neuroscience study of the TTC (pn-TTC) study, in which early adolescents were recruited from the general population [78]. The participants in the pn-TTC study were subsampled from a larger participant group in the TTC study, a large-scale longitudinal population-based cohort survey involved 3,171 early adolescents living in the Tokyo metropolitan area [77]. Written informed assent and consent were obtained from each participant and her/his primary parent, respectively, before participation. All protocols were approved by the research ethics committees of the Graduate School of Medicine and Faculty of Medicine at the University of Tokyo (approval nos. 3150, 10057, and 10069), Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science (approval no. 12–35), and the Graduate University for Advanced Studies (SOKENDAI) (approval no. 2012002). The details of the overview and recruitment are described in Supplementary Method1and elsewhere [20,21]. Age and sex of each participant were identified by self-report. In addition, trends in gender dysphoria were identified by self-report, although they were not analyzed in this study. Race or ethnicity was not asked in the TTC study, because most participants in the TTC study had the same ethnic and racial origin. The pn-TTC data were collected from October 2013 to February 2016 for Time 1 and from April 2016 to March 2018 for Time 2. The interval between the two visits in the pn-TTC study was set to approximately two years. MRS data were obtained from 253 adolescents (134 boys and 119 girls, mean 11.5 y) at Time 1 and 237 adolescents (128 boys and 109 girls, mean 13.6 y) at Time 2. We had previously published studies including MRS data also used in this study [20,21]. Data were analyzed from January 2019 to September 2023. MRI scanning was conducted on a Philips Achieva 3T system (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with an 8-channel receive head coil. Most participants visited twice, at Times 1 and 2, with an interval of approximately two years. Each participant underwent a series of MRI scans including fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), a T1 three-dimensional (3D) magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (3D-MPRAGE), MR angiography (MRA), and MRS sequences. However, not all participants underwent all the above-mentioned sequences for various reasons, such as interruption of scanning due to participant fatigue. Similar to our previous studies, subjects with any abnormal brain organic findings detected by radiologists using 3D-MPRAGE, FLAIR, and MRA data were excluded from the current study. For MRS, 1H-MRS spectra were collected from a 30 × 30 × 30 mm3voxel of interest (VOI) in the pregenual ACC with the MEGA-PRESS method [79]. The reason the MEGA-PRESS method was chosen is that, while glutamate was the primary target metabolite in this study, it was deemed meaningful to explore not only glutamate but also GABA. The pregenual ACC VOI was positioned anterior and close to the corpus callosum genu tip and centered on the interhemispheric fissure (Fig.1a, b). Spectral data were obtained using the following parameters: repetition time/echo time, 2000 ms/68 ms; 320 acquired transients; 2048 sample points; bandwidth, 2000 Hz; and 16-step phase cycle. Acquisition time was approximately 10 min 42 s. MEGA-editing was achieved with 15-ms Gaussian editing pulses applied at 1.90 ppm (ON) and 7.46 ppm (OFF) in alternate spectral lines. Water suppression was achieved using the multiply optimized insensitive suppression train (MOIST) water suppression techniques (for Philips scanners). Voxel-of-interest (VOI) placements for the participant at Time 1 (a) and Time 2 (b) are demonstrated. A VOI for1H MRS was placed at the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in 3D-T1 anatomical images (left, axial plane; middle, sagittal plane; right, coronal plane). VOIs were highlighted for visual purposes. The analysis results of1H MRS spectra of the participant collected at Time 1 (c) and Time 2 (d) are shown. MEGA-editing was achieved with 15-ms Gaussian editing pulses applied at 1.90 ppm (ON) and 7.46 ppm (OFF) in alternate spectral lines. Actual spectra (the difference between edit ON and OFF spectra) (gray line) and their LCModel fits (red line) are displayed, where co-edited Glx signal peaks (~3.75 ppm) are clearly detectable. All MRS data were at first processed using the Gannet 3.2 toolbox [80]. MRS VOIs were coregistered to the corresponding T1-weighted images using GannetCoRegister. Regarding the longitudinal analysis, displacement over time of the center of the MRS VOI was calculated based on the coordinate of the MRS VOI’s center originating at the center of the anterior commissure after the coregistration of T1-weighted images to the MNI-ICBM152 template. In addition, using GannetSegment, T1-weighted images were segmented by Statistical Parametric Mapping 12 (SPM12,www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), and then the tissue fraction (f) of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the VOI was quantified (Supplementary Fig.1). Regarding the longitudinal analysis, the changes in the tissue fraction of GM, WM, and CSF for the VOI were calculated. Visual inspection was performed for coregistration and segmentation (Supplementary Fig.2). Next, MEGA-PRESS difference spectra were analyzed to obtain Glx levels with the LCModel package version 6.3 [81], a frequency domain spectral fitting program (Fig.1c, d). A recent study reported that Glx levels estimated from MEGA-PRESS difference spectra explained 96 percent of the variance of the known Glx concentration of phantoms [82]. This fitting method provides the concentrations [institutional units (i.u.)] of the metabolites including Glx. The control parameter sptype for the LCModel analysis was set to mega-press-3. The LCModel software automatically performs frequency-and-phase correction based on the water-suppressed and unsuppressed reference spectra and automatically conducts water scaling and fitting to calculate neurometabolite levels by referencing to the unsuppressed water peak. For partial volume correction, the 1H-MRS visible water concentration (mM) in the VOI was calculated according to the formula [(43300fGM+ 35880fWM+ 55556fCSF)/(1 −fCSF)] provided by the LCModel manual (http://s-provencher.com/pub/LCModel/manual/manual.pdf), and subsequently inputted into the LCModel analysis. The concentrations of water (mM) in GM, WM, and CSF are 43300, 35880, and 55556, respectively. Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) were used to express uncertainties in quantifying metabolite levels. Only metabolite spectra with an LCModel-estimated uncertainty of <20% standard deviations (SDs) were included in this study to reject low-quality spectra. Moreover, for a contrast analysis, all MRS data analyzed in the Glx analysis were processed for analysis of GABA plus macromolecule (GABA+) using GABA analysis toolkit ‘Gannet’ (Supplementary Fig.3). Using GannetFit, edited GABA signals were fitted and GABA+ levels were assessed. GannetCoRegister and GannetSegment were used as described above. To correct for partial volume effects, data were processed using GannetQuantify, which combines modeled peak areas from GannetFit and voxel tissue fractions from GannetSegment with preset values for GABA and water relaxation and visibility [83]. Only metabolite spectra with Gannet fit error of <20% SDs were included in this study to reject low-quality spectra. Data of subclinical psychotic experiences were obtained longitudinally at Times 1 and 2. Four questions administered in the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC-C) were used in the current study to assess subclinical psychotic experiences [46]. A total score of subclinical psychotic experiences can range from 0 (low) to 8 (high). Bullying victimization data were obtained at Time 1 using two self-administered questions and one parent-administered question [77,84]. Participants were dichotomized into non-bullied victims (0) and bullied victims (1). Help-seeking intention data were obtained at Time 1. Help-seeking intentions were assessed using the same method as in our previous study [85]. Participants were dichotomized into those without help-seeking intentions (0) and those with help-seeking intentions (1). Information on socioeconomic status (SES) was obtained longitudinally (Times 1 and 2). SES was classified based on the annual household income and SES scores can range from 1 (low income) to 11 (high income) [77]. In principle, the averaged SES scores were included in the analysis models. In the present analysis, two subtests (information, picture completion) of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Third Edition (WISC-III) were collected and used for calculation of intelligence quotient (IQ) at Time 1. Our rationale for only using the two subtests of WISC-III is as follows. The full version of the WISC-III was conducted for 28 children one year after the initial survey using the two subtests. Using multiple regression analysis with full IQ as a dependent variable and the results of the two subtests as independent variables, a formula for estimating IQ from the two subtests was created and the estimated IQ explained 78% of the variance of the full IQ [77]. Detailed explanations regarding psychological and environmental evaluation are described in the Supplementary Method2. Power analyses were conducted (Supplementary Method3). All statistical analyses, except where noted, were performed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 27 (IBM Corp.). The statistical significance level was set top< 0.05 (two-tailed). In principle, subjects with both Glx and subclinical psychotic experience data were included in our current analyses. Mean imputation was performed for missing covariates data. First, we investigated the association of Glx levels with subclinical psychotic experiences at each time point. Partial Spearman’s correlation between Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences was assessed, adjusted for age at MRI scanning, sex, SES, and IQ. In addition, we investigated whether the Glx level changes and changes in subclinical psychotic experiences between the two time points were associated. Partial Spearman’s correlation between Glx level changes and changes in subclinical psychotic experiences between the two time points was assessed, adjusted for MRI scan interval, sex, SES, and IQ. Multiple testing correction with the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) method was performed using p.adjust in R 4.0.5. Second, the effects of bullying victimization and help-seeking intention on Glx levels at Times 1 and 2 were investigated. Glx levels were adjusted for age, sex, SES, and IQ in a linear regression model. After checking whether all the assumptions were met, a three-factor mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with age-sex-SES-IQ-adjusted Glx levels as the dependent factor, bullying victimization and help-seeking intention as between-subjects factors, and time as a within-subjects factor. Finally, we performed path analysis to determine the relationships among variables including bullying victimization, help-seeking intention, age-sex-SES-IQ-adjusted Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), which is a non-parametric analysis technique. All subjects enrolled in the ANOVA study were included. Basically, in this analysis, paths from bullying victimization to Glx levels and paths from Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences were regarded as the main connections, and the moderating effects of help-seeking intention on paths from bullying victimization to Glx levels were also investigated. We created a time lagged model, where latent variables at two time points were separately included, and a latent change score model, where latent baseline (intercept) variables and latent change (slope) variables were included. The PLS-SEM analyses were implemented using the SmartPLS 4.0 software, which allows us to estimate direct and moderating (interaction) effects. Bootstrapping method with 5,000 random resamples was used. The fit of the PLS-SEM model was evaluated using standardized root mean residual (SRMR), which is provided by the SmartPLS 4.0 software. An SRMR value of less than 0.10 indicates an acceptable fit to the model [86]. Indirect effects were also assessed using PLE-SEM models. For a contrast analysis, GABA+ levels were statistically analyzed in ways similar to those used in Glx analysis. The details are described in the Supplementary Method4. The flow chart of subject inclusion and exclusion is shown in Supplementary Table1. Demographics and basic results in this study are presented in Table1. For the longitudinal dataset analyzed (n= 157), the mean displacement of the center of the MRS VOI was 5.2 mm, equal to the diagonal of a 1.7 mm cube, and the mean changes in the tissue fraction of GM, WM, and CSF for the VOI were −2.7%, 1.7%, and 1.0%, respectively. Bullying victimization was not significantly associated with help-seeking intention (Supplementary Table2). Associations over time between Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences were investigated. Subclinical psychotic experiences were significantly negatively associated with Glx levels at both time points (Time 1,n= 219,ρ= −0.14, FDR-correctedp= 0.045, uncorrectedp= 0.042; Time 2,n= 211,ρ= −0.14, FDR-correctedp= 0.045, uncorrectedp= 0.045) (Fig.2a, b), and changes in subclinical psychotic experience over time were significantly negatively associated with Glx level changes (n= 157,ρ= −0.21, FDR-correctedp= 0.026, uncorrectedp= 8.5 × 10−3) (Fig.2c). aThe association at Time 1,bthe association at Time 2, andcthe association between longitudinal changes are illustrated. Significant negative associations between Glx levels in the pregenual ACC and subclinical psychotic experiences at both Times 1 (a) and 2 (b) as well as between over-time changes in the two variables were found (c). Glx combined glutamate-glutamine, SPE subclinical psychotic experience, i.u. institutional units. The effects of bullying victimization and help-seeking intention on Glx levels were investigated. All the assumptions of an ANOVA, such as the normal distribution of age-sex-SES-IQ-adjusted Glx levels, were met. The main effects of bullying victimization (F= 13,p= 4.1 × 10−4) and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction effects (F= 8.4,p= 4.3 × 10−3) on age-sex-SES-IQ-adjusted Glx levels were significant (n= 156) (Fig.3), while there were no significant effects of help-seeking intention (F= 1.3,p= 0.26), time (F= 0.31,p= 0.58), time × bullying victimization interaction (F= 0.038,p= 0.85), time × help-seeking intention interaction (F= 2.1,p= 0.15), or time × bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction (F= 1.7,p= 0.19). Specifically, the bullied group showed lower ACC Glx levels than the non-bullied group for all participants. Post hoc Bonferroni tests revealed that while the help-seeking and non-help-seeking groups showed similar Glx levels within the non-bullied group (F= 2.5,p= 0.12), the help-seeking group showed higher Glx levels than the non-help-seeking group within the bullied group (F= 6.0,p= 0.016). Light blue-colored bars represent Glx levels at Time 1, and pink-colored bars represent Glx levels at Time 2. Bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction had significant effects on Glx levels. The bullied group showed lower ACC Glx levels than the non-bullied group for all participants. Post hoc tests revealed that while the help-seeking and non-help-seeking groups showed similar Glx levels within the non-bullied group, the help-seeking group showed higher Glx levels than the non-help-seeking group within the bullied group. BV bullying victimization, HSI help-seeking intention, Glx combined glutamate-glutamine, i.u. institutional units. Path analyses were performed to determine the relationships among variables including bullying victimization, help-seeking intention, age-sex-SES-IQ-adjusted Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences using PLS-SEM. First, a time lagged model was created, and the PLS-SEM test revealed that the current model fitted the data well (n = 156, SRMR = 0.000) (Fig.4a). Specifically, the path coefficient (PC) from bullying victimization to Glx levels at Time 1 (PC = −0.92,p= 0.045), PC from bullying victimization to Glx levels at Time 2 (PC = −1.16,p= 0.036), PC from Glx levels at Time 1 to Glx levels at Time 2 (PC = 0.18,p= 0.019), PC from Glx levels at Time 1 to subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 1 (PC = −0.23,p= 0.002), and PC from subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 1 to subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2 (PC = 0.303,p= 0.000) were significant, whereas the PC from Glx levels at Time 2 to subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2 was trend-level significant (PC = −0.17,p= 0.072). The PC from Glx levels at Time 1 to subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2 was not significant (PC = −0.11,p= 0.14). In addition, help-seeking intention significantly moderated the path from bullying victimization to Glx levels at Time 2 (PC = 1.2,p= 0.033) but not the path from bullying victimization to Glx levels at Time 1 (PC = 0.63,p= 0.21). As for total indirect effects, Glx levels at Time 1 had a significant impact on subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2 (PC = −0.10,p= 0.005), and bullying victimization had a trend-level significant impact on subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2 (PC = 0.39,p= 0.057). As for specific indirect effects, subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 1 significantly mediated the association between Glx levels at Time 1 and subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2 (PC = −0.071,p= 0.018). No further indirect effects were observed. Path analyses were performed to determine the relationships among variables including bullying victimization, help-seeking intention, age-sex-SES-IQ-adjusted Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences using PLS-SEM. Results ofathe time lagged model and ofbthe latent change score model are illustrated here. Squares represent observed variables and circles represent latent variables. Solid arrows represent direct effects and dashed arrows represent moderation effects. Path coefficients (pvalues in parentheses) are shown on corresponding arrows. Indirect effects were also assessed. In the time lagged model (a), Glx levels at Time 1 had a significant total indirect effect on subclinical psychotic experience at Time 2, and bullying victimization had a trend-level significant total indirect impact on subclinical psychotic experience at Time 2. In the latent change score model (b), bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction had significant total indirect effects on differences in Glx levels. BV bullying victimization, HSI help-seeking intention, GLX combined glutamate-glutamine, SPE subclinical psychotic experience, T1 Time 1, T2 Time 2 BASE baseline, DIFF difference. Next, a latent change score model was created, while the PLS-SEM test revealed that the current model fitted the data slightly poorly (n= 156, SRMR = 0.11) (Fig.4b). Specifically, the PC from bullying victimization to baseline Glx levels (PC = −1.4,p= 0.008), PC from baseline Glx levels to differences in Glx levels (PC = 0.97,p= 0.000), and PC from baseline subclinical psychotic experiences to differences in subclinical psychotic experiences (PC = 0.97,p= 0.000) were significant, while the PC from baseline Glx levels to baseline subclinical psychotic experiences (PC = −0.17,p= 0.092) was trend-level significant. The PC from bullying victimization to differences in Glx levels (PC = 0.082,p= 0.56), PC from baseline Glx levels to differences in subclinical psychotic experiences (PC = 0.15,p= 0.98), and PC from differences in Glx levels to differences in subclinical psychotic experiences were non-significant (PC = −0.19,p= 0.98). In addition, help-seeking intention significantly moderated the path from bullying victimization to baseline Glx levels (PC = 1.4,p= 0.014) but not the path from bullying victimization to differences in Glx levels (PC = 0.000,p= 1.0). As for total indirect effects, bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction had significant effects on differences in Glx levels (bullying victimization, PC = −1.4,p= 0.007; bullying victimization × help-seeking intention, PC = 1.4,p= 0.012). As for specific indirect effects, baseline Glx levels significantly mediated the association between bullying victimization and differences in Glx levels (PC = −1.4,p= 0.007) and the association between bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction and differences in Glx levels (PC = 1.4,p= 0.012). Baseline subclinical psychotic experiences mediated the association, at a trend level, between baseline Glx levels and differences in subclinical psychotic experiences (PC = −0.17,p= 0.090). No further indirect effects were observed. Analyses of GABA+ levels did not reveal any significant results (Supplementary Results1, Supplementary Figs.4–6). In this study, we revealed a negative association between Glx levels in the pregenual ACC and subclinical psychotic experiences at both Times 1 and 2, as well as for changes over time. Moreover, we found significant bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction effects on Glx levels. Specifically, bullying victimization decreased Glx levels, whereas help-seeking intentions increased Glx levels only in adolescents with bullying victimization. Finally, our PLS-SEM analysis revealed associations among bullying victimization, help-seeking intentions, Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences. We revealed a negative association between Glx levels in the pregenual ACC and subclinical psychotic experiences at both Times 1 and 2 (Fig.2a, b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study of the association between glutamatergic function in the pregenual ACC and subclinical psychotic experiences in the general adolescent population, and the first to reveal a negative association between Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences at two time points. Recent 7-tesla MRS studies have reported lower glutamate and glutamine levels in the dorsal ACC in patients with schizophrenia [87] and FEP [32,33,88] compared to healthy controls. This seems in line with our findings despite different subregions of interest within the ACC and different subclinical/clinical stages. In addition, other recent 7-tesla MRS studies have reported lower glutamate levels in the pregenual ACC in patients with residual schizophrenia [89] and FEP [90] compared to healthy subjects. This seems in line with our findings despite different subclinical/clinical stages, and it is suggested that our findings may extend the already known findings of lower glutamate levels in the pregenual ACC after psychosis onset to those before onset (subclinical psychotic experiences). In contrast, as described above, recent meta-analyses reported higher ACC glutamate levels [91] and higher Glx and glutamate levels in the dorsal ACC (middle cingulate cortex) in treatment-resistant schizophrenia [28]. Combining our findings with the above studies, it is suggested that ACC glutamate substrates in adolescent subclinical psychotic experiences, FEP, and residual schizophrenia may be different from those in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. As mentioned above, the results on ACC glutamatergic levels in genetic high-risk subjects are so far controversial [7,35]. In addition, a recent 7-tesla MRS study has reported no alterations in glutamate levels in the dorsal ACC in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, characterized by an increased risk of psychosis [92]. Taken together, genetic risk factors for psychosis may have a smaller effect on glutamatergic levels in the ACC (especially its pregenual part) compared to environmental factors, examples of which will be discussed below. Future studies will be necessary to reveal in more detail how various risk factors for psychosis affect ACC glutamatergic levels. We revealed a negative association of ACC Glx level changes with changes in subclinical psychotic experiences over a period of two years (Fig.2c). This is concordant with our findings of a negative association between ACC Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences at each time point (Fig.2a, b). Given negative associations between Glx levels and subclinical psychotic experiences at two time points as well as for over-time changes, our findings suggest that Glx levels in the pregenual ACC may in the future be able to help assess the current state of or within-person changes in psychotic experiences, although further studies are needed to verify its utility. We found significant bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction effects on Glx levels (Fig.3). Specifically, the bullied group showed lower ACC Glx levels than the non-bullied group for all participants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to elucidate the association of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors with glutamatergic function in human adolescents. Previous studies have reported lower ACC glutamatergic levels in traumatized youths [59,60]. Recent mouse studies have reported that exposure to social stress decreases Glx levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) [93] and reduces the ratio of vesicular glutamate 1 transporter to vesicular GABA transporter, representing the ratio of glutamate to GABA in the synapse, in the prelimbic cortex of the mPFC [94], homologous to the human pregenual ACC [95]. These studies are in line with our findings. A recent adolescent arterial spin-labeling study has reported increased activation in the ventral ACC during a social exclusion task, which was positively correlated with the extent of previous exposure to bullying victimization [74]. We assume that Glx levels in the ventral ACC may affect the regional blood flow changes in response to social rejection. In summary, our finding regarding the negative effect of bullying victimization on ACC Glx levels suggests a neurobiological basis of the psychosis-inducing effects of bullying victimization. In addition, while the help-seeking and non-help-seeking groups showed similar Glx levels within the non-bullied group, the help-seeking group showed higher Glx levels than the non-help-seeking group within the bullied group. A recent study has reported increased glutamate and Glx levels in the ventral ACC after brief mindfulness training, which is a preventive strategy for psychological well-being [96]. It is suggested that acts of self-care such as help-seeking intentions and meditation may promote psychological well-being through increased Glx levels in the ventral ACC. Our finding suggests a neurobiological substrate for the antipsychotic role of help-seeking intentions against adversity. Combining with our other results discussed above (Fig.2a–c), our findings elucidated neural substrates underlying the association among bullying victimization, help-seeking intention, and subclinical psychotic experiences according to the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. In addition, it should be crucial for supporting healthy adolescent brain development to implement adolescent education to prevent bullying and promote help-seeking behavior in case of being bullied. Our PLS-SEM analysis revealed associations among bullying victimization, help-seeking intentions, Glx levels, and subclinical psychotic experiences. Specifically, with a time lagged model (Fig.4a), Glx levels at Time 1 had a significant indirect total impact on subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2, which suggests that Glx levels affect subclinical psychotic experiences even two years later. In addition, subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 1 significantly mediated the association between Glx levels at Time 1 and subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2, which suggests that lower Glx levels may result in persistent subclinical psychotic experiences. Given that persistent subclinical psychotic experiences are associated with later transition to clinical psychosis [97] and poor psychological outcomes in adolescence [98], it is suggested that lower Glx levels in early adolescence may act as a risk factor for various psychological symptoms through persistent subclinical psychotic experiences. Moreover, bullying victimization had a trend-level significant indirect effect on subclinical psychotic experiences at Time 2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the neurometabolic basis of the phenomenon on the association between bullying victimization and subsequent psychotic symptoms [53,54]. In addition, with a latent change score model (Fig.4b), the PC from bullying victimization to baseline Glx levels was significant and the PC from baseline Glx levels to baseline subclinical psychotic experiences was trend-level significant. This finding is mostly in line with our above-mentioned results (Figs.2a,b,3,4a). However, the PC from differences in Glx levels to differences in subclinical psychotic experiences was not significant, suggesting no relationships between latent change scores of Glx levels and of subclinical psychotic experiences. This finding is not in line with our above-mentioned results on the association of ACC Glx level changes with changes in subclinical psychotic experiences over a period of two years (Fig.2c), which may have to be cautiously interpreted. Moreover, help-seeking intention significantly moderated the path from bullying victimization to baseline Glx levels. Bullying victimization and bullying victimization × help-seeking intention interaction had significant effects on differences in Glx levels. This finding is in line with our above-mentioned results (Figs.3and4a). Our contrast analysis revealed no association of pregenual ACC GABA+ levels with subclinical psychotic experiences (Supplementary Fig.4), which is in concordance with our hypothesis. Our findings are consistent with previous research showing no alterations in pregenual ACC GABA+ levels in patients with schizophrenia, those with FEP, and high-risk individuals [28,65]. Rowland et al. reported lower-than-normal ACC GABA+ levels in older but not younger patients with schizophrenia and their steeper-than-normal age-related decline in schizophrenia [99]. Thus, it may be suggested that pregenual ACC GABA+ levels are likely to be normal in the early stages of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, although further studies are required to confirm this suggestion. An adolescent electroencephalogram study from our group reported a positive association between longitudinal changes in psychological difficulties and those in auditory duration mismatch negativity, a marker for decreased glutamatergic neurotransmission, while no such association was found in the gamma-band auditory steady-state response, reflecting GABAergic interneuron function [100]. It is suggested that this supports our current findings despite different modalities and brain regions of interest. We also found no association of pregenual ACC GABA+ levels with bullying victimization or help-seeking intentions (Supplementary Fig.5). A recent study of healthy adults reported no association between ACC GABA levels and perceived stress [101], supporting our findings. Further studies are required to explore this phenomenon in more detail. This study had several limitations. First, neurometabolite levels measured using MRS include not only synaptically acting neurotransmitters but also pools (not used as neurotransmitters). Thus, the exact synaptic glutamate signaling status could not be assessed using this technique. Second, accurate separate quantification of glutamate and glutamine, whose molecular structures are very similar, is usually challenging with MRS techniques, especially the MEGA-PRESS method, due to the low efficiency in editing signals of the two metabolites [82]. Thus, Glx has often been analyzed instead of each of the two metabolites. In studies that report findings on Glx levels including our current study, Glx levels are usually interpreted as reflecting glutamatergic function. Although this is at least partly correct since Glx is the combined pool of glutamate and glutamine and glutamate is synthesized from glutamine, it should be noted that Glx levels do not perfectly account for the glutamatergic function. Third, our results using Glx estimates from MEGA-PRESS difference spectra should be carefully interpreted as some previous studies reported a positive but relatively low correlation between Glx estimates from MEGA-PRESS difference spectra and Glx estimates from spectra with the widely used PRESS sequence [102]. In contrast, as mentioned above, MEGA-PRESS difference spectra can mostly accurately estimate Glx concentrations of phantoms [82]. Further studies are expected to explore to what extent or how accurately MEGA-PRESS difference spectra can estimate actual Glx levels in the human brain. Fourth, the acquisition of spectra was limited to only one VOI and only one MRS sequence in this study because of time constraints and our desire to avoid participants tolerating undue stress. It would have been ideal to acquire spectra from another VOI as the control region and to add another MRS sequence such as PRESS. Fifth, the sample size of the bullied and non-help-seeking group was small (n= 9). Thus, our results should be cautiously interpreted. Sixth, while our study and some previous studies revealed similar findings of lower Glx levels in subjects with higher psychotic features [32,33,88,90], this similarity should be carefully interpreted. As mentioned above, psychotic experiences at the age of around 12 are a risk factor for psychotic disorders at age 18 [48]. However, it is unclear so far to what extent and how accurately psychotic experiences in early adolescence can be linked to being at clinical high-risk or the onset of FEP. Further studies are expected to solve this question. Finally, adolescent patients with schizophrenia were not examined in this study, as those with evident psychiatric or neurological disorder were excluded. However, all the participants were drug naïve for psychotropic drugs in this study, which should be rather a strong point for adolescent brain imaging research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal a longitudinal trajectory of the association between ACC glutamatergic function and subclinical psychotic experiences in the general adolescent population and to elucidate the effect of commonly experienced environmental emotional/social stressors on glutamatergic function, which can be related to psychosis. Our findings may deepen the understanding of how environmental emotional/social stressors induce impaired glutamatergic neurotransmission that could be the underpinning of liability for psychotic experiences in early adolescence. The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to ethical reasons but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

The finding suggests that this neurotransmitter — a chemical messenger that transmits nerve impulses for communication by a nerve cell — may be a potential target for pharmaceutical interventions aimed at reducing the risk of psychotic disorders.
Psychosis is a mental state characterized by loss of contact with reality, incoherent speech and behavior, and typically hallucinations and delusions seen in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.
Recent studies investigating links between neurological and psychiatric features of certain disorders have found that individuals who experience their first episode of psychosis or have schizophrenia that remains treatable, have lower-than-normal levels of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain’s anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) region. The ACC is known to play a crucial role in regulating emotions, decision-making and cognitive control, while glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in a wide range of functions, including learning, memory and mood regulation.
Alterations in glutamate levels have been implicated in various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression and anxiety, and so measuring ACC glutamate levels can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of the nervous system underlying these disorders and their treatment.
However, until now, changes in glutamate levels in the ACC in those individuals at high risk of psychosis, and the relationship between this and the effects of bullying in adolescents has remained unclear.
And so researchers at the University of Tokyo used magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or MRS, a type of radiological imaging applied to depict brain structure and function, to measure glutamate levels in the ACC region of Japanese adolescents. They then measured the glutamate levels at a later point, allowing them to assess changes over time, and compare these changes to experiences with bullying or lack thereof, as well as with any intention on the part of those experiencing bullying to seek help.
Bullying victimization was tracked via questionnaires completed by the adolescents. The researchers then used formalized psychiatric measurement to assess experiences of bullying victimization based on those questionnaires, such as tallying the frequency and assessing the nature of events involving physical or verbal aggression, and also capturing their impact on overall mental health.
They found that bullying was associated with higher levels of subclinical psychotic experiences in early adolescence — those symptoms come close to psychosis but do not meet the full criteria for a clinical diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. These symptoms or experiences can include hallucinations, paranoia or radical alterations in thinking or behavior and can have a significant impact on well-being and functioning, even in the absence of a psychotic disorder diagnosis.
“Studying these subclinical psychotic experiences is important for us to understand the early stages of psychotic disorders and for identifying individuals who may be at increased risk for developing a clinical psychotic illness later on,” said Naohiro Okada, lead author of the study and project associate professor at the University of Tokyo’s International Research Center for Neurointelligence (a research center under Japan’s World Premier International Research Center Initiative program).
Crucially, the researchers found that higher levels of these subclinical psychotic experiences were associated with lower levels of anterior cingulate glutamate in early adolescence.
“First and foremost, anti-bullying programs in schools that focus on promoting positive social interactions and reducing aggressive behaviors are essential for their own sake and to reduce the risk of psychosis and its subclinical precursors,” said Okada. “These programs can help create a safe and supportive environment for all students, reducing the likelihood of bullying and its negative consequences.”
Another potential intervention is to provide support and resources for adolescents who have experienced bullying victimization. This might include counseling services, peer support groups and other mental health resources that can help adolescents cope with the negative effects of bullying and develop resilience.
While Okada’s group has identified a potential target of pharmacological interventions, he added that nonpharmacological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based interventions may also serve to target this neurotransmitter imbalance.

Our surprising magnetic galaxy,"To ensure we keep this website safe, please can you confirm you are a human by ticking the box below. If you are unable to complete the above request please contact us using the below link, providing a screenshot of your experience. https://ioppublishing.org/contacts/","A team of astronomers including those from the University of Tokyo created the first-ever map of magnetic field structures within a spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy. Previous studies on galactic magnetic fields only gave a very general picture, but the new study reveals that magnetic fields in the spiral arms of our galaxy break away from this general picture significantly and are tilted away from the galactic average by a high degree. The findings suggest magnetic fields strongly impact star-forming regions which means they played a part in the creation of our own solar system.
It might come as a surprise to some that magnetic fields can exist on scales larger than a planet. Most of our daily experience with magnetic fields involves either sticking things to our refrigerator, or perhaps using a compass to point north. The latter shows the existence of magnetic fields generated by our planet. Our sun also creates a vast magnetic field, and this can affect phenomena like solar flares. But magnetic fields that span the galaxy are almost too large to comprehend, and yet they likely have a role in the formation of stars and planets.
“Until now, all observations of magnetic fields within the Milky Way led to a very limited model that was uniform all over and largely matched the disc shape of the galaxy itself,” said Assistant Professor Yasuo Doi from the Department of Earth Science and Astronomy. “Thanks in part to telescope facilities at Hiroshima University capable of measuring polarized light to help us ascertain magnetic signatures, and the Gaia satellite launched by the European Space Agency in 2013, which specialized in measuring the distances to stars, we are able to build a better model with finer details in three dimensions. We focused on a specific area, the Sagittarius arm of our spiral galaxy (we are in the neighboring Orion arm) and found the dominant magnetic field there breaks away from the plane of the galaxy significantly.”
Previous models and observations could only imagine a smooth and largely homogeneous magnetic field in our galaxy; whereas the new data show that although magnetic field lines in the spiral arms do roughly align with the galaxy at large, at small scales the lines are actually spread out across a range of distances due to various astrophysical phenomena such as supernovae and stellar winds. The galactic magnetic fields are also incredibly weak, around 100,000 times weaker than Earth’s own magnetic field. Despite this, however, over long time spans, gas and dust in interstellar space are accelerated by these fields which explains the presence of some stellar nurseries — star-forming regions — that cannot be explained by gravity alone. This finding implies further mapping of the magnetic fields within our galaxy could help better explain the nature and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies too.
“I am personally intrigued by the foundational process of star formation, pivotal to the creation of life, including ourselves, and I aim to grasp this phenomenon in its entirety with time,” said Doi. “We aim to further our observations and build better models of galactic magnetic field structures. This endeavor aims to provide observational insights into the accumulation of gas fueling active star formation within our galaxy and its historical development.”

While bilaterians have diversified blastema formation methods, its mechanisms in non-bilaterians remain poorly understood. Cnidarian jellyfish, or medusae, represent early-branching metazoans that exhibit complex morphology and possess defined appendage structures highlighted by tentacles with stinging cells (nematocytes). Here, we investigate the mechanisms of tentacle regeneration, using the hydrozoan jellyfishCladonema pacificum. We show that proliferative cells accumulate at the tentacle amputation site and form a blastema composed of cells with stem cell morphology. Nucleoside pulse-chase experiments indicate that most repair-specific proliferative cells (RSPCs) in the blastema are distinct from resident stem cells. We further demonstrate that resident stem cells control nematogenesis and tentacle elongation during both homeostasis and regeneration as homeostatic stem cells, while RSPCs preferentially differentiate into epithelial cells in the newly formed tentacle, analogous to lineage-restricted stem/progenitor cells observed in salamander limbs. Taken together, our findings propose a regeneration mechanism that utilizes both resident homeostatic stem cells (RHSCs) and RSPCs, which in conjunction efficiently enable functional appendage regeneration, and provide novel insight into the diversification of blastema formation across animal evolution.

Common regenerative processes include wound closure immediately after injury; formation of the cellular source, or blastema, that reconstitutes the lost tissue; and regrowth of the tissue that integrates different cellular behaviors such as proliferation and differentiation [1]. Among these regenerative responses, blastema formation is a critical step that can distinguish regenerative and non-regenerative systems. Indeed, most mammalian and avian species do not form blastema upon injury while wound closure occurs normally [2]. Understanding blastema formation mechanisms in highly regenerative animals may therefore help us identify the necessary elements to potentially improve our regenerative abilities. Blastema can be defined as an undifferentiated cellular mass that contains cells with mitotic capacity and appears after damage such as amputation [3,4]. Accumulating evidence has suggested that methods of blastema formation vary among animals with high regenerative abilities [5]. For example, in planarians, pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts that are distributed throughout the body are recruited to the injury site to produce blastema [6]. Salamanders can regenerate adult limbs upon amputation via blastema formation, but the underlying cellular mechanisms vary among species: in the axolotl, tissue-specific stem cells contribute to blastema, while in the newt, muscle fibers dedifferentiate into proliferative progenitor cells to behave as blastema [7]. During zebrafish caudal fin regeneration, both osteoblast-derived dedifferentiated cells and resident progenitor cells migrate to the wound site to form blastema [8,9]. These studies support the idea that the supply of blastema has diversified across the animal kingdom, whose members utilize resident stem/progenitor cells and/or repair-specific de novo proliferative cells to reconstruct lost body parts. While mechanisms of blastema formation have been studied extensively in a limited number of regenerative animals, little is known about their evolutionary characteristics: Which elements are acquired as lineage-specific novelties and which are widely conserved within highly regenerative species? In particular, the current understanding of blastema formation largely relies on bilaterian models, and thus the mechanisms of blastema formation outside of bilaterians remain poorly understood. Among various regeneration contexts, appendage regeneration is widely observed in bilaterians (e.g., amphibian limbs and fish fins) and is suitable for understanding the evolution of regenerative processes [3,10]. The bilaterian program of blastema formation during appendage regeneration is associated with repair-specific stem/progenitor cells [7,9,11]. Yet, to elucidate the evolutionary history of blastema formation programs, their mechanisms must be studied in early-branching metazoans in addition to bilaterian models. Cnidarians (corals, sea anemones, hydroids, and jellyfish) are among the earliest branching metazoans, composed of 2 major groups Anthozoa and Medusozoa, forming a diverse phylum that contains over 10,000 species, and stand at a unique phylogenetic position as the sister group to bilaterians (Fig 1A). While cnidarians display considerably divergent morphologies and life cycles, represented by the polyp and medusa stages; their common traits are a diploblastic radially symmetric body along with tentacles as the well-defined appendages that bear the stinging cells, nematocytes (cnidocytes) [12,13]. Although regenerative potential may vary among the group, most documented cnidarian species are capable of regenerating lost tissues and organs, and some can even regenerate their entire body [14,15].

After mid-gastric bisection inHydra, cell proliferation of the stem cells, or i-cells, around the wound site is accelerated by Wnt3a produced from dying cells to generate blastema [19]. Upon decapitation of the colony polypHydractinia, i-cells remotely located in the body column migrate to the injury site to form blastema [20]. During head regeneration of the sea anemoneNematostella, 2 adult stem-like cell populations, fast-cycling cells in the body wall epithelium and slow-cycling cells in the mesenteries, migrate toward the amputation site to form blastema [21]. These studies suggest that the recruitment of resident stem cells to the injury site is a prerequisite for blastema formation after amputation of the body. However, it remains unclear whether repair-specific proliferative cells (RSPCs) constitute the cellular source of blastema during cnidarian regeneration. In contrast to the sessile polyp stage, medusae, commonly called jellyfish, exhibit a more complex body structure that includes multiple types of muscle such as smooth and striated muscles, developed neural networks, and distinct organs and appendages, which together enable free swimming and avoidance behaviors [22,23]. While most sexually reproducing medusae do not clonally propagate like polyps, medusae can still regenerate various organs and appendages (e.g., manubrium, tentacle, umbrella, gonad, eye) after injury and reconstitute de novo structures after their removal [24–30]. A recent report using the hydrozoan jellyfishClytiahas suggested that, upon removal of the entire manubrium, i-cells and differentiated cells localized in neighboring organs migrate to the damage site through the canals, contributing to de novo manubrium regeneration [27]. Despite the importance of proliferating blastema cells in highly regenerative animals, the detailed mechanisms of organ and appendage regeneration in medusae, particularly the mechanism of blastema formation and its specific role are largely unknown. The hydrozoan jellyfishCladonema pacificumis an emerging jellyfish model that has been utilized to study development and physiology [31–33]. BecauseCladonemaallows for easy lab maintenance with its high spawning rate, it enables monitoring all life cycle stages and exploring organismal responses to different stimuli. The genusCladonemais morphologically characterized by branched tentacles at the medusa stage (Fig 1B) [31,34–36]. TheCladonemamedusa tentacle is primarily composed of bilayered epithelial tissues (epidermis and gastrodermis) that include muscle fiber, also called epitheliomuscular cells [23]: i-cells, neurons, and nematocytes are located in the epidermal layer while neurons and gland cells are located in the gastrodermal layer. Resident stem cells, i-cells, are localized at the basal side of the tentacle (tentacle bulb), and are thought to give rise to progenitors and differentiated cells during normal development and homeostasis [24,37]. The continuous growth and branching potential of the medusa tentacle makes it an attractive model to understand the mechanisms of appendage morphogenesis, growth, and regeneration in cnidarians. In this study, we investigate the cellular mechanism of appendage regeneration using theCladonemamedusa tentacle. Establishing theCladonematentacle as an organ that can efficiently and functionally regenerate upon amputation, we show that highly proliferative cells accumulate at the injury site within 24 h to behave as blastema. Pulse-chase experiments using nucleoside analogs as well as dye labeling reveal that most blastema cells are not derived from resident stem cells but rather appear locally after damage. We further identify the role of blastema cells as the principal cellular source of the epithelium in the newly formed tentacle, while resident stem cells contribute to nematogenesis and tissue elongation during both homeostasis and regeneration. These results suggest the existence of 2 distinct proliferative cell populations: blastema as RSPCs and resident stem cells as homeostatic stem cells, both of which collectively enable functional tentacle regeneration. In a broader context, our findings highlight the diversification of blastema formation in non-bilaterian systems, providing an evolutionary insight into animal regeneration. Cladonema pacificum(female strain 6W) medusae were used for this research. The medusae were maintained in plastic containers (V-type container, V-7, V-8, and V-9; AS ONE) at 22°C in artificial sea water (ASW). ASW was prepared using SEA LIFE (Marin Tech) dissolved in tap water with chlorine neutralizer (Coroline off; GEX Co.) (24 p.p.t). The medusae were fed Vietnamese brine shrimp (A&A Marine LLC). Before surgical manipulation, the medusae were anesthetized with 7% MgCl2in deionized water for 2 min in a petri dish (Falcon, 351008). Surgical manipulations were performed with micro scissors (Teraoka, NY33408). After manipulations, the medusae were quickly returned to ASW. When the tentacle was amputated with the bulb left intact, the medusae were fed 1 day before manipulation and were starved after amputation. When the tentacle was amputated along with the bulb, the medusae were fed 1 day before manipulation and were fed 3 times a week afterward. Bright field pictures of medusae were taken with a LEICA S8APO microscope with a Nikon digital camera (D5600) or a Zeiss AXIO Zoom.V16. The medusae were anesthetized with 7% MgCl2in deionized water for 5 min and fixed at room temperature (RT) for 1 h or overnight at 4°C with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in ASW. After fixation, the samples were washed 3 times (10 min each) with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (0.1% PBT). The samples were incubated in primary antibodies in 0.1% PBT overnight at 4°C. The antibodies used were mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich, T6793), rabbit anti-FMRFamide (1:1,000; ImmunoStar, 20091), rabbit anti-Phospho-Histone H3 (Ser10) (1:500; Upstate, 06–570), mouse anti-β-catenin (8E4) (1:100; Enzo, ALX-804-260-C100), and rabbit anti-PKC ζ C20 (1:100; Santa Cruz, sc-216). After primary antibody incubation, the samples were washed 3 times (10 min each) with 0.1% PBT. The samples were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500; ALEXA FLUOR 488, 555, 647 Donkey or Goat anti-mouse IgG, ALEXA FLUOR 488, 555, 647 Donkey or Goat anti-rabbit IgG; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Hoechst 33342 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, H1399) in 0.1% PBT for 1 h in the dark. After 3 washes (10 min each) in 0.1% PBT, the samples were mounted on slides with 70% glycerol. Nuclear and poly-γ-glutamate were stained with DAPI (1:250; Invitrogen, D1306), and actin fibers were stained with Alexa 546 phalloidin (1:400; Invitrogen, A22283) in 0.1% PBT for 1 h. Confocal images were collected through a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. Image processing (color display) and quantification were performed using ImageJ/Fiji software. The medusae were incubated with 150 μm 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) (EdU kit; Invitrogen, C10337) in ASW for 1 h or 24 h. In chase labeling, the medusae were washed with ASW at least twice (up to 3 times, depending on amount). In pulse labeling, after EdU treatment, the medusae were anesthetized with 7% MgCl2in deionized water and fixed 4% PFA in ASW. After fixation, the samples were washed and incubated with an EdU reaction cocktail (1× reaction buffer, CuSO4, Alexa Fluor azide 488 or 647, and 1× reaction buffer additive; all included in EdU kit; Invitrogen, C10337 or C10340) for 30 min in the dark. After the EdU reaction, the samples were washed and incubated with Hoechst 33342 in 0.1% PBT for 30 min. In combination with antibody staining, EdU reaction was performed after incubation with the secondary antibody. To combine EdU labeling with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), the EdU reaction was performed after the incubation with Cy5-tyramide solution. The medusae were incubated with 150 μm EdU in ASW for 1 h or 24 h before amputation, depending on the experiments. Just after incorporation of EdU, the medusae were washed in ASW 3 times, and tentacles were amputated. At 24 hpa, the medusae were incubated with 2.5 mM BrdU (abcam, ab142567) in ASW for 1 h. The medusae were washed out in ASW 3 times. The medusae were anesthetized with 7% MgCl2for 5 min and fixed with 4% PFA in ASW. The samples were washed 3 times with 0.1% PBT and incubated with an EdU reaction cocktail for 30 min in dark. The samples were washed 3 times and treated with 2N HCl for 30 min and then washed 3 times and incubated in primary antibodies in 0.1% PBT overnight at 4°C. The primary antibody used was mouse anti-BrdU (1:100; BD, 347580). The samples were washed 3 times and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500; ALEXA FLUOR 555 Goat anti-mouse IgG) and Hoechst 33342 in 0.1% PBT for 1 h in the dark and washed 3 times. The following FISH protocol was created from the published protocol [38]. The sequences ofNanos1,Nanos2, andPiwihave been previously described [39], the presumptive sequence ofMinicollagen1(Mcol1) andVasa1were acquired from the annotation of an RNA-seq result [33]. Purified total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by PrimeScript II 1st strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, 6210A) or SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech). A cDNA library was used as a template for PCR (Nanos1,Nanos2,Piwi, andMcol1) and 3′ RACE (Vasa1). The primer sets used for PCR cloning are as follows:Nanos1: 5′-AAGAGACACAGTCATTATCAAGCGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCACGTAAAATTGGACACGTCG-3′ (reverse),Nanos2: 5′- ACTTCTCCAAAACCTCATGCCGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′- GAATGGCGGGCGATTTGACATCC-3′ (reverse),Piwi: 5′- CACACAAGAGTTGGACCGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′- ACCGGCTTATCGATGCAACA-3′ (reverse),Vasa1: 5′-GCCACCCAAAGAAGACAGACAGACAC-3′ (forward for 3′RACE) and 5′-CGAAACGACTTGCTGATTTTCTCGCCAG -3′ (nested forward for 3′RACE),Mcol1: 5′-CTCGTCGGTATTGCCCTCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAACCTATCGTGGACGTGT-3′ (reverse). PCR products were subcloned into the TAK101 vector (TOYOBO) and RACE product was subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The resulting plasmids were used for RNA probe synthesis with digoxigenin (DIG) labeling mix (Roche, 11277073910) or fluorescein (FITC) labeling mix (Roche, 11685619910), and T7 (Roche, 10881767001) or T3 RNA polymerase (Roche, 11031163001) was used, according to the insert direction. Medusae were anesthetized 7% MgCl2for 5 min and fixed overnight at 4°C with 4% PFA in ASW. Briefly, fixed samples were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), followed by pre-hybridization in hybridization buffer (HB buffer: 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% Tween-20, 50 μg/ml tRNA, 50 μg/ml heparin) at 55°C for 2 h. The samples were hybridized with HB buffer containing the antisense probes (final probe concentration: 0.5–1 ng/μl in HB buffer) at 55°C overnight. The samples were washed twice each with wash buffer 1 (5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% Tween-20), wash buffer 2 (2 × SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% Tween-20), and 2 × SSC. The samples were then washed with 0.1% PBST and incubated in 1% blocking buffer (1% blocking reagent [Roche] in Maleic acid) for 1 h. The samples were incubated with anti-DIG-POD antibodies (1:500; Roche, 11207733910) in 1% blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The samples were then washed with Tris-NaCl-Tween Buffer and incubated with Cy5-tyramide solution (TSA Plus Cyanine 5; AKOYA Biosciences, NEL745001KT) for 10 min. Finally, the samples were washed with 0.1% PBST and incubated with Hoechst 33342 in 0.1% PBST for 30 min in the dark and washed 3 times. For double FISH, DIG for low expression genes and FITC probes for high expression genes were used (S3E Fig;Nanos1-DIG andNanos2-FITC,S3F Fig;Mcol1-DIG andNanos2-FITC). The samples were then washed with Tris-NaCl-Tween Buffer after incubation with anti-DIG-POD antibodies and incubated with Cy3-tyramide solution (TSA Plus Cyanine 3; AKOYA Biosciences, NEL744001KT) for 10 min. The samples were washed with 0.1% PBST and incubated with 3% H2O2for 15 min. The samples were washed with 0.1% PBST and incubated with anti-Fluorescein-POD antibodies (1:500; Roche, 11426346910) in 1% blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The samples were then washed with Tris-NaCl-Tween Buffer and incubated with Cy5-tyramide solution for 10 min. Finally, the samples were washed with 0.1% PBST and incubated with Hoechst 33342 in 0.1% PBST for 30 min in the dark and washed 3 times. Medusae were relaxed in 7% MgCl2on a petri dish, and 10 mM CellTracker CM-DiI (Invitrogen, C7001) was injected into the epidermal layer of the tentacle bulb or the center of the tentacle, using a micro injector (Eppendorf, Femtojet 4i). The quartz capillary (Sutter Instrument, QF100-70-10) was pulled by Laser-Based Micropipette Puller P2000 (Sutter Instrument). After injection, injected tentacles were amputated. To identify DiI-labeled cells, medusae were incubated with 150 μm EdU for 1 h before DiI injection or antibody staining was performed after DiI injection using anti-β-catenin. To monitor DiI-labeled cells during blastema formation, at 24 hpa, the injected medusae were incubated with 150 μm EdU in ASW for 1 h. The medusae were relaxed in 7% MgCl2and fixed in 4% PFA. After washing in 0.1% PBT, the medusae were incubated with an EdU reaction cocktail for 30 min in the dark. After the EdU reaction, the samples were washed and incubated with Hoechst 33342 in 0.1% PBT. The medusae were placed in a V7 plastic container with 6 to 8 ml of ASW, the minimum required for their maintenance. X-ray irradiations were performed using an X-ray machine (mediXtec, MX-160Labo). Medusae were positioned 19 cm from the X-ray source, and a dose of 30 Gy (19.3 min at 160 kV 3 mA), 50 Gy (32.2 min at 160 kV 3 mA), or 75 Gy (48.3 min at 160 kV 3 mA) was delivered. After irradiation, the medusae were moved to a plastic container with fresh ASW. The medusae were incubated with 10 mM hydroxyurea (HU) (085–06653; Wako, Osaka, Japan) or 30 μm Mitomycin C (139–18711; Wako, Osaka, Japan) in ASW (ASW only for control). Drug incubation was sustained over 3 days. Medusae were fed every other day, and the drug solutions were renewed after feeding. Total RNA was purified from the whole tentacles of 3 medusae with RNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen). Lysate was treated with Dnase I (Qiagen, 79254) for 15 min at RT. cDNA was synthesized from 200 ng of total RNA by Prime script RT master Mix (Takara, RR036A). RT-qPCR was performed using TB Green Premix Ex TaqII (Tli RnaseH Plus) (Takara, RR820L) and a Quantstudio6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher) usingF-actin capping protein subunit beta(CpCapZbeta) as an internal control [32]. The qPCR primer sets are as follows:CpCapZbeta: 5′-AAAGAAAGCTGGAGACGGTTCA-3′ (Forward), 5′-GTAGTGGGCATTTCTTCCGC-3′ (Reverse),Nanos1: 5′-TTCGTCAAGTGGCAGTCGTG-3′ (Forward), 5-CAAGCCCTGGTACAAACGGA-3′ (Reverse). Tentacles were amputated at 1 day before UV exposure. At 24 hpa, the medusae were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (1:250) for 20 min and washed 3 times in ASW. After washing, the relaxed medusae were placed on slides with 7% MgCl2and enclosed with cover glass. UV laser was exposed to the blastema region of the amputated tentacle using the photo bleaching application (50 cycles at 100% 405 laser power) of the Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope. The bleached region is shown with a white dot square (400 × 400 pixels, W × H) inS11B Fig. After UV exposure, the medusae were moved to ASW in plastic containers and monitored to examine the effect on regeneration. Three areas were defined (the basal, middle, and distal regions) by dividing the tentacle into 3 equal lengths in confocal images (Figs2A, 2B,3C, 3D,S2A and S2B). The number of PH3+, EdU+, orNanos1+cells was counted manually in each area using the multipoint tool of ImageJ/Fiji. The PH3+, EdU+, orNanos1+cell ratio (Figs2D–2F,4I,4J,S7B,S7C, S7E and S7F) was measured by counting the total number of cells as well as the PH3+, EdU+, orNanos1+cells using ImageJ/Fiji. Each signal+cell was counted manually using the multipoint tool of ImageJ/Fiji. Total cell number quantification was performed as follows: (1) Binarize the signal of Hoechst staining using the “Threshold” command. (2) Divide continuously adjacent multiple nuclei using the “Watershed” command. (3) Measure the number of nuclei using the “Analyze Particles” command. Other cell number counting (Figs3A, 3B, 3E, 3F,4C–4F,5B, 5C, 5F, 5G,6B, 6C, 6E, 6F,S2C,S2E,S4C–S4E,S5A–S5D,S6B, S6C,S8A, S8B,S10,S11C and S11D) was performed manually using the multipoint tool of ImageJ/Fiji. The tentacle length (Fig 5Kand6I) was measured using the segment line tool of ImageJ/Fiji. The tentacle area (S5C–S5E Fig) was recorded as the ROI with the polygon selection tool and measured by ImageJ/Fiji. The quantification area was marked with rectangle tool, and the signal intensity was measured by ImageJ/Fiji (S2D Fig). Statistical analyses were performed using Excel and Graphpad Prism9. Two tailedttests were used for comparisons between 2 groups. Significance is indicated in the figures as follows: *P≤ 0.05, **P≤ 0.05, ***P≤ 0.001, Not Significant (NS):P> 0.05. Bar graphs show mean ± standard error. Dots in bar graphs and boxplots indicate individual values. For cnidarians, tentacles are essential and common appendages for capturing prey and defending against predators. Cnidarian polyps such asHydra,Hydractinia, andNematostellahave tentacles in the head region, near the hypostome, which can restore functional tentacles during head regeneration [18,20,40]. Similarly, studies using hydrozoan jellyfish have shown that medusae tentacles can regenerate upon amputation [24,27]. Although cnidarians commonly exhibit high regenerative capacity for tentacles, the exact cellular processes and the limitation of regeneration are poorly understood. To monitor the process of tentacle regeneration and to explore its responses to different dissections, we utilized the medusa tentacle of the hydrozoan jellyfishCladonema(Fig 1). InCladonematentacles, proliferative cells including stem cells, or i-cells, are localized on the basal side, called the tentacle bulb, while nematocytes are distributed as clusters on the distal side, similar to the jellyfishClytia(Figs1C,2Ai, 3Ci,S1A,S3A–S3D,S4Ai, andS4Bi) [24,37,39]. The existence of localized stem cells at the bulb prompted us to examine tentacle regeneration as a model for appendage regeneration in non-bilaterians. When the tentacle was amputated with the bulb left intact (Fig 1D and 1E), wound closure finished by 24 hours post-amputation (hpa) (S1B and S1C Fig), at which point the injury site became smooth surface (Fig 1Di and 1Dii). Subsequently, tentacles began to elongate distally, and nematocyte clusters, the spherical structures stained with the mature nematocyte marker poly-γ-glutamate, formed at the tip of the regenerating tentacle at 48 hpa (Figs1Diii, 1Fiii, andS1A). The number of nematocyte clusters increased during tentacle elongation, and these clusters were localized along the distal side at 72 hpa, which is when the regenerating tentacle branched, a characteristic feature of the genusCladonema(Fig 1Div and 1E). Notably, these regeneration processes occurred without feeding, suggesting that tentacle regeneration is an immediate response for the organism to re-construct the organ that is required for capturing food. To investigate the subtleties of tentacle morphology at cellular resolution during regeneration, we visualized the muscle fibers, mature nematocytes, and neurons by staining F-actin, poly-γ-glutamate, and FMRFamide and acetylated tubulin, respectively (Figs1F, 1G,S1D, andS1E). During the early stages of regeneration (0 to 24 hpa), wound closure occurred progressively via the accumulation of supra-cellular actin fibers (Fig 1Fiand 1Fii). Accordingly, muscle fibers regenerated during tentacle elongation (Fig 1Fiii and 1Fiv). While mature nematocytes were rarely found in the bulb or the injury site until 24 hpa (Fig 1Fi and 1Fii), nematocytes began to accumulate at the tip of the regenerating tentacle at 48 hpa and formed clusters at 72 hpa (Fig 1Fiii and 1Fiv). The re-formation of neurons on the distal side occurred at 48 hpa and completed at 72 hpa (Figs1G,S1D, andS1E). These results suggest that the regenerating tentacle is fully functional after 48 hpa. To test this possibility, we examined whether the regenerating tentacle is capable of feeding. While the regenerating tentacle was not functional until 24 hpa, more than half of the regenerating tentacles captured prey at 48 hpa (55%), and this ratio reached 100% at 72 hpa (Fig 1H and 1I). These results indicate thatCladonemamedusae can fully regenerate a functional tentacle within 2 to 3 days of amputation. While theCladonemamedusa tentacle can almost always regenerate with the bulb left intact, it is unclear whether the tentacle can still regenerate even after the bulb has been removed (Fig 1Ji). We thus ablated the entire tentacle, including the bulb, and monitored the regeneration process. After amputation, the ring canal and the radial canal adhered, and the wound closure completed at 1 day post-amputation (dpa) (Fig 1Jii). The injured area began to bulge as early as 5 dpa, and the transparent wound site turned orange, which reflects the color of its food,Artemia(Fig 1Jiii). The de novo tentacle bulb reformed within 1 to 2 weeks with a nematocyte cluster at the tip, and the small tentacle gradually elongated (Fig 1Jiv and 1K). Because the rate of successful regeneration varied dramatically while rearing medusae under the same conditions and feeding frequency, tentacle bulb regeneration likely depends on the health condition of the individual medusa (S1F Fig). We also examined the regenerative potential of isolated tentacles. While the whole body cannot be regrown from isolated tentacles inHydraorNematostella[21,41], polyps in the jellyfishAurelia auritacan regenerate from isolated tentacles [42]. To examine the regeneration capacity of the isolated tentacle inCladonema, we culturedCladonemamedusa tentacles either with or without the bulb left intact. Although wound closure successfully occurred regardless of the existence of the bulb, tissues, and organs located to the proximal side of the tentacle including the umbrella, the radial canal, and the bulb, did not regenerate, and the isolated tentacle gradually degenerated (S1G and S1H Fig). These observations together show that theCladonemamedusa tentacle can functionally regenerate after amputation, but that its organ repair capacity is restricted to the organism that recognizes the missing tentacle, likely through the canals, as previously shown in theClytiamedusa [27]. For our remaining studies, we focused our attention on the process of tentacle regeneration with the bulb intact, which provides a highly reproducible and tractable system. During organ regeneration, blastema forms at the regenerating tip after wound closure and contributes to reconstruction of the new tissue as a source of cell proliferation and differentiation [1,2]. In order to investigate the timing of blastema formation duringCladonematentacle regeneration, we performed pulse labeling of EdU, an S-phase marker (Fig 2A) [43]. To understand the spatial pattern of cell proliferation, we defined 3 areas in the regenerating tentacle (the basal, middle, and distal regions) and quantified the distribution of proliferating cells. Consistent with the localization of stem cells (Figs3Ci,S4Ai, andS4Bi) [39], cell proliferation in the intact tentacle was mainly detected on the basal side (Fig 2Ai and 2B). By contrast, cell proliferation in the regenerating tentacle was frequently observed on the distal side near the wound area at 24 hpa (Fig 2Aii and 2B). At 72 hpa, unlike at 24 and 48 hpa, cell proliferation was detected in the middle and on basal side, not on the distal side (Fig 2Aiv and 2B). To investigate the exact timing of the cell proliferation increase at the injury site, we examined the localization of EdU+cells every 4 h immediately after amputation to 24 hpa (S2C Fig). We found that the number of proliferating cells significantly increased at 20 hpa and peaked at 24 hpa (S2D and S2E Fig). We further confirmed the pattern of proliferating cells using the M-phase marker, anti-Phospho-Histone 3 (PH3) antibody. While PH3+cells were distributed across the basal side before amputation, in the regenerating tentacle, PH3+cells accumulated on the distal side at 24 hpa, and gradually localized on the basal side starting at 48 hpa (Figs2D,S2A, andS2B), which is consistent with the results of EdU+cell distribution (Fig 2A–2C). These results also reflect the fact that differentiated nematocytes accumulate on the distal side at 48 hpa and 72 hpa (Fig 1D and 1F). Together, these observations suggest that cell proliferation is accelerated near the injury site at 24 hpa.

We thus investigated proliferative activity in detail during the early phase of tentacle regeneration (Fig 2D–2F). In the regenerating tip, the number of PH3+and EdU+cells was about 4 and 20 times greater, respectively, than the corresponding area (amputation site) in the intact tentacle (Fig 2D–2F). Moreover, these PH3+and EdU+cell numbers at the regenerating tip were significantly greater than those in the bulb of the intact tentacle where resident stem cells are localized (Fig 2D–2F). Notably, nearly half of the cells in the regenerating tip are EdU+cells (Fig 2Dii and 2F). Altogether, these results indicate that proliferative activity in the regenerating tip is much higher than that of cells not in the regenerating tip, which provides evidence that blastema cells appear during tentacle regeneration. To determine whether blastema formation is specific to the location of amputation, we examined the localization of proliferating cells after dissecting tentacles in different ways. When the distal side of the tentacle is amputated, ectopic cell proliferation was observed near the injury site at 24 hpa (Fig 2G). Similarly, when the tentacle was amputated with the bulb, cell proliferation occurred around the injury site where the canals merged at 24 hpa (Fig 2H). These results suggest that blastema is formed around the injury site regardless of the location of amputation. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that blastema is a prerequisite for proper regeneration of the tentacle. To test this possibility, we examined whether blastema formation occurs in the isolated tentacle, which fails to regenerate basal tissue (S1G and S1H Fig). In the isolated tentacle, EdU+cells were not detected at the injury site at 24 hpa (Fig 2I). These results together suggest that blastema formation is associated solely with the regenerating tentacle. What cell types constitute blastema? In hydrozoans, i-cells behave as pluri-/multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into progenitors and differentiated lineages [45]. Indeed, i-cells in hydrozoan jellyfish includingClytiaandCladonema, which are mainly localized at the tentacle bulb, are defined by (1) morphological features like a large nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio with prominent nucleoli; (2) the expression of stem cell marker genes such asNanos1andPiwi; and (3) the ability to self-renew and differentiate into multiple cell types [39,46,47]. It is thus possible that undifferentiated stem cells like i-cells contribute to blastema. In order to confirm the cell types that form blastema, we utilized the combination of β-catenin antibody staining and nuclear staining, which can distinguish i-cells (including i-cells and early nematoblasts), nematocytes, and epithelial cells (Fig 3A). In bothHydractiniaandCladonema, i-cells were identified by cytoplasmic signals of β-catenin, together with the large nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and prominent nucleoli [39,48]. While nematocytes exhibit crescent-shaped nuclei, epithelial cells show a polygonal shape delineated by the membrane-localized β-catenin (Fig 3Aiii). Through the quantification of cell types, we found that around 80% of blastema cells were i-cells, 10% were epithelial cells, and 10% were nematocytes (Fig 3A and 3B), indicating that most cells in blastema are morphologically i-cells.

FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization; hpa, hours post-amputation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3002435.g003 To molecularly characterize these blastema cells, we examined the expression of the stem cell markers,Nanos1,Piwi, andVasa1by FISH. Note that, whileCladonemapossess 2Nanosgenes,Nanos1andNanos2,Nanos2+cells co-express a nematoblast markerMcol1, suggesting thatNanos2is a nematoblast marker rather than a stem cell marker inCladonemamedusa (S3E and S3F Fig), similar toHydractinia[49]. In the intact tentacle,Nanos1+,Piwi+, orVasa1+cells, are primarily distributed in the bulb and branching site (Figs3Ci,S3A–S3D,S4Ai, andS4Bi) [38,39]. By contrast, at 24 hpaNanos1+cells accumulated around the injury site where blastema formed (Fig 3Cii), andPiwi+andVasa1+cells were also localized in the blastema region (S4Aii and S4Bii Fig). WhileNanos1+cells accumulated to the new branching bud after 48 hpa (Fig 3Ciii, white arrow) [38,39],Nanos1expression was no longer detected at the regenerating tip and was restricted to the middle and basal side of the tentacle (Fig 3Ciii). We further quantified the distribution ofNanos1+cells and found a gradual transition of their distribution from the distal to the basal side of the regenerating tentacle (Fig 3D). These results are consistent with the distribution pattern of proliferative cells (Figs2A–2C,S2A, andS2B), further supporting the idea that proliferative cells in blastema exhibit characteristics of stem cells. Previous reports on cnidarian regeneration have suggested that undifferentiated blastema cells are supplied by the migration of resident stem/progenitor cells in response to injury [20,21,27]. To test whether resident stem cells, or originally localized i-cells, in the bulb migrate to the injury site to form blastema, we performed EdU-chase experiments duringCladonematentacle regeneration. We leveraged the fact that short-time incubation of EdU labels proliferating i-cells in the intact tentacle, and, after incubating, amputated and visualized the regenerating tentacle at different time points (S5A Fig). Until 24 hpa, most EdU+cells remained localized to the bulb while a small number of EdU+cells were distributed near blastema (S5Ai–S5viandS5B Fig). Following 48 h and 72 h chasing, EdU+cells continued to localize at the basal side, including the bulb, rather than in the regenerating tip, although the population of EdU+cells propagated in the distal direction, likely through cell proliferation and migration (S5Avii and S5Aviii Fig). Considering the minimal contribution of EdU+i-cells to blastema, these observations suggest that resident stem cells localized at the bulb may not be sufficient to form blastema. We further conducted an alternative tracing experiment that specifically labels cells in the bulb region by DiI microinjection followed by amputation and cell tracking, which allows monitoring the labeled cells in vivo during tentacle regeneration (S6 Fig). To confirm the cell-type of DiI+cells in the bulb, we first combined EdU staining or β-catenin antibody staining with DiI injection (S6A–S6C Fig) to show that more than 75% of EdU+cells or i-cells (β-catenin cytoplasm signal) were DiI+in the bulb (S6A–S6C Fig), indicating that the majority of resident i-cells are labeled by DiI injection. After a 24 h chase, DiI+cells were still localized near the bulb, not merged with EdU+cells in blastema (S6D and S6Ei–S6ii Fig). In contrast, when DiI was injected into the central area near the amputation site, DiI+cells overlapped with EdU+cells, participating in blastema formation (S6D and S6Eiii–S6iv Fig). These results, taken together with the EdU chase results, suggest that resident stem cells do not migrate to the blastema region. The above experiments support the presence of 2 populations of proliferative cells during regeneration: one population are the “resident homeostatic stem cells (RHSCs),” composed of cycling i-cells localized at the bulb, and the other are “repair-specific proliferative cells (RSPCs)” that appear as blastema upon amputation. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed chasing experiments by labeling the 2 proliferative cell populations with distinct nucleoside analogs, EdU and BrdU (Fig 4A). This approach has been utilized in different animal systems as a way to track proliferative cell populations and their lineages [50–52]. We labeled RHSCs in the bulb by EdU before amputation and RSPCs in the blastema by BrdU at 24 hpa (Fig 4A). At the time of blastema formation at 24 hpa, EdU+RHSCs were still localized to the bulb, while BrdU+RSPCs accumulated at the blastema (Fig 4Bi). Importantly, only 13.6% of BrdU+RSPCs were EdU+in blastema, supporting the notion that the migration of RHSCs may not be sufficient to form blastema (Fig 4Bi,4Cii and 4D). Indeed, following 24 to 48 h, BrdU+RSPCs were distributed on the distal side of the regenerating tentacle, EdU+RHSCs remained localized on the basal side, although their distribution expanded slightly (Fig 4Bii and 4Biii). Consistent with these observations, when DiI was injected to the center area near the injury site, these DiI+cells initially contributed to RSPCs and were gradually distributed to distal side in the regenerating tentacle (S6H and S6I Fig). These results suggest that RSPCs at the blastema participate in the formation of the new structure while RHSCs expand locally, supporting the existence of 2 distinct proliferative cell populations during tentacle regeneration (Fig 4G).

For this purpose, we quantified the increase in cell numbers of the 2 populations during tentacle regeneration. At 24 hpa, RHSCs increased approximately 2-fold, but no dramatical increase was observed in the following 48 h (Fig 4E; 0 hpa:n= 206 ± 66.6, 24 hpa:n= 441.3 ± 100.6, 48 hpa:n= 493.3 ± 123.2, 72 hpa:n= 593.7 ± 250.3). Notably, the number of these RHSCs also increased during 24 h without amputation (S5C and S5D Fig), suggesting that the increase of RHSCs is not an injury-specific response. In contrast, the number of RSPCs in the blastema tripled at 48 h, which led to an approximate 4-fold increase at 72 hpa (Fig 4F; 24 hpa:n= 275.1 ± 64.2, 48 hpa:n= 929.3 ± 151.9, 72 hpa:n= 1,125 ± 225.1). These results indicate a pronounced difference in proliferative activity between the 2 populations, further implicating their distinct responses to injury. If RSPCs do not derive from RHSCs in the bulb, blastema should form when such stem cells are removed. To test this possibility, we examined blastema formation after RHSCs are eliminated by X-ray irradiation. We first determined a condition that would eliminate resident stem cells after exposure to different doses of X-ray irradiation (30, 50, 75 Gy) by monitoring expression of the stem cell markerNanos1. FISH staining ofNanos1showed thatNanos1+cells decreased in an X-ray dose-dependent manor, and mostNanos1+cells were removed at 75 Gy at 3 days post-irradiation (dpi) (S7A–S7C Fig). qPCR analysis further confirmed a significant reduction ofNanos1mRNA levels at 3 dpi (S7G Fig). We thus amputated the tentacle at 3 dpi and investigated blastema formation by EdU pulse labeling (Fig 4H). At 24 hpa, blastema formed successfully regardless of X-ray irradiation, although the rate of EdU+cells in the blastema decreased slightly (Fig 4I and 4J). In order to support the conclusion derived from X-ray irradiation, we also performed pharmacological treatments using hydroxyurea (HU) or Mitomycin C, both of which are used to eliminate i-cells in other hydrozoan species [20,53,54]. The results of FISH and qPCR confirmed that mostNanos1+cells are removed by HU or Mitomycin C treatment for 3 days (S7D–S7G Fig). We then examined blastema formation after HU or Mitomycin C treatment and found that blastema formed at 24 hpa, consistent with the results of X-ray irradiation (Fig 4I and 4J). Combined, these results suggest that distinct proliferative cell populations appear during tentacle regeneration and that most blastema cells are not derived from RHSCs. In the tentacles of hydrozoan medusae such asClytiaandCladonema, proliferative i-cells in the bulb are proposed to migrate from the basal to the distal side while differentiating into nematocytes, which is known as the belt conveyor model [24,37,55]. Based on this proposed model, we hypothesized that RHSCs in the bulb contribute to nematogenesis during both homeostasis and regeneration. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed EdU and BrdU double chase experiments with some modifications (Fig 5A). We found that long-incubation with EdU for 24 h allows for the labeling of RHSCs in the bulb as well as nematocyte progenitors labeled byMcol1(Figs5BiandS8). After EdU labeling for 24 h, followed by amputation, most EdU+cells remained in the bulb, and 26.9% of the BrdU+RSPCs were EdU+in the blastema, supporting the notion that the majority of RSPCs are of different lineage than RHSCs (Fig 5Bii, 5Biv and 5C). This result is consistent with the results of the chasing experiment using short duration EdU labeling (Fig 4A–4D), further supporting the conclusion that the migration of RHSCs in the bulb is not sufficient to form blastema. At 72 hpa, while EdU+cells were still distributed in the basal region, including the bulb, some EdU+cells were located in the distal nematocyte clusters (Fig 5Bv: yellow arrow), suggesting that one of the lineages of RHSCs are nematocytes during regeneration. We also performed DiI labeling of the bulb to show that these DiI+cells were distributed in nematocyte clusters in the regenerated tentacle (S6F and S6G Fig: white arrow).

We found that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) antibody can be utilized to detect cell types with nuclear staining, which is a method similar to using β-catenin antibody (Figs3A,5D, andS9) [39,48]. The combination of EdU chasing and cell type identification revealed that nearly half of the EdU+cells are nematocytes in the distal side of the tentacle (nematocytes: 45.7%, epithelial cells: 24.2%, i-cells: 30.1%;Fig 5E–5G). These results together indicate that RHSCs in the bulb differentiate into nematocytes during regeneration. Intriguingly, we also noticed that EdU-labeled RHSCs merged with FMRFamide+neurons (S10A and S10B Fig), suggesting that RHSCs can differentiate into neurons during tentacle regeneration. Given that the RHSCs mainly differentiate into both nematocytes and epithelial cells during regeneration (Fig 5F and 5G), it is expected that these cells play a role in supplying new nematocytes as well as in tentacle elongation. We first examined the timing of nematocyte cluster formation as a readout of nematogenesis when RHSCs were eliminated by X-ray or drug treatments using HU or Mitomycin C (Fig 5H–5J) and found that it was delayed, particularly at the early stage of regeneration after elimination of RHSCs (Fig 5I and 5J), indicating that RHSCs migrate from the basal to the distal side while differentiating into nematocytes during regeneration. Next, we measured tentacle length during regeneration with RHSCs cells removed by X-ray irradiation or drug treatments (Fig 5H and 5K). When tentacles were amputated at 3 dpi by which time RHSCs had been eliminated by X-ray, tentacle elongation was severely inhibited compared to the non-irradiated controls (Fig 5K, regenerated tentacle length at 4 dpa, Control: 1.66 mm, X-ray: 0.540 mm). It is possible that X-ray irradiation affects the source of RSPCs to some extent, and indeed when RHSCs were removed with HU or Mitomycin C treatment, tentacle elongation was mildly but still significantly inhibited (Fig 5K, regenerated tentacle length at 4 dpa, HU: 1.14 mm, Mitomycin C: 1.19 mm). Given that EdU+blastema cells appear after X-ray irradiation as well as drug treatments (Fig 4I and 4J), RHSCs contribute to tentacle elongation independently of blastema cells. We speculate that RHSCs, and particularly their decedents, participate in tissue elongation likely through pushing out from the basal side as progenitors and differentiating into epithelial cells. In order to investigate the role of RSPCs during regeneration, we performed EdU chase labeling of the blastema with cell type identification by aPKC antibody staining (Fig 6A–6C). While 94.4% of the RSPCs exhibited i-cell morphology at 24 hpa (Fig 6Bi,6Biii and 6C, consistent with the results of β-catenin antibody staining inFig 3A and 3B), 59.2% of EdU+cells were epithelial cells in the distal portion of the regenerating tentacle at 72 hpa (Fig 6Bii, 6Biv and 6C). Strikingly, in contrast to RHSCs, EdU+cells derived from the blastema did not become nematocytes (Figs5E–5Gand6A–6C). These results suggest that RSPCs preferentially differentiate into epithelial cells in the regenerating tentacle. Of note, we found that a small portion of EdU-labeled RSPCs merged with FMRFamide+neurons, although these populations are significantly smaller than the RHSCs (S10C–S10E Fig). Combined, these findings indicate that RSPCs are multipotent, or at least bipotent, stem cells that preferentially generate epithelial cells during regeneration.

UVA radiation (320 to 400 nm) induces various forms of cellular damage via the production of reactive oxygen species or the impairment of proteasomal function, which blocks cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase in both mammalian cultured cells and fly epidermal progenitors [56–59]. In addition, Hoechst and BrdU are known photosensitizers [60,61], which can facilitate the process of damage induction. To verify the effects of UVA on RSPCs, we performed UV laser illumination around the blastema region at 25 hpa and counted the number of EdU-labeled cells (Figs6D–6F). Following around 24 to 48 h, the number of EdU+cells decreased significantly in the UV-exposed tentacle compared to the control, indicating that UV laser exposure inhibits cell proliferation of RSPCs (Fig 6F). In contrast, we confirmed that cell proliferation and the timing of nematocyte cluster formation by RHSCs were similar to the non-UV exposure controls, suggesting a minimal impact of UV laser exposure on RHSCs (S11 Fig). In order to examine the contribution of the proliferation of RSPCs toward tentacle regeneration, we monitored the length of regenerating tentacles after UV laser exposure (Fig 6G). Upon UV laser illumination, tentacle elongation during regeneration was significantly inhibited (Fig 6H and 6I). These results, together with the distribution of their descendants on the distal side of the regenerating tentacle (Figs4Biiiand5Biii), indicate that proliferation of RSPCs contribute to the reconstruction of new tentacles after amputation. In this study, we uncovered the cellular mechanism underlying blastema formation duringCladonematentacle regeneration. We found that, upon amputation of the tentacle, RSPCs accumulate as blastema, most of which is not derived from RHSCs. While RHSCs contribute to nematogenesis and tissue elongation during both homeostasis and regeneration, RSPCs differentiate into the epithelial cells of the newly formed tentacle. Based on these results, we propose that distinct proliferative cell populations facilitate rapid functional regeneration of the tentacle, which enables critical behaviors of jellyfish organismal physiology such as feeding and swimming (Fig 7A). (A) When aCladonemamedusa tentacle is amputated, wound closure is completed by 24 hpa. After wound healing, RSPCs appear and actively proliferate at the wound tip. Ectopic cell proliferation on the distal side is gradually suppressed, and the cell differentiation phase begins. While RHSCs in the bulb continuously proliferate and supply nematocytes and epithelial cells, RSPCs mainly differentiate into epithelial cells. (B) Blastema formation mechanism during appendage regeneration across animal evolution.

Although i-cells exhibit common features such as their interstitial localization, cellular morphology, and expression of the conserved stem cell markers (Nanos,Piwi,Vasa,PL10); their potency and heterogeneity likely differ across species [45]. Indeed,Hydrai-cells differentiate into most cell types except epithelial cells, whileHydractiniai-cells behave as pluripotent cells that can differentiate into all cell types including somatic and germline cells [16,62,63]. In the intactCladonemajellyfish,Nanos1+,Piwi+, andVasa1+cells are primarily distributed at the bulb (Figs3C,S4A, andS4B), and about 70% of RHSCs in the bulb areNanos1+cells (Fig 3E and 3F). From nucleoside pulse-chase experiments, these RHSCs differentiate into epithelia as well as nematocytes (Fig 5F and 5G), suggesting their role as multipotent stem cells. These observations are consistent with the jellyfishClytia, in which i-cells in the bulb proliferate and differentiate into nematocytes [37,55], indicating that i-cells in the tentacle bulb are commonly involved in organ homeostasis including nematogenesis in hydrozoan jellyfish. In contrast to RHSCs in the bulb, only 17% to 36% of RSPCs at blastema expressNanos1+,Piwi+, andVasa1+(Figs3E, 3F, andS4C–S4E), although more than 80% of blastema cells show i-cell morphology (Figs3A, 3B,6B, and6C). These results imply that the stem-like population of the blastema is likely heterogenous and differs from that of resident i-cells in the bulb. Indeed, RSPCs predominantly differentiate into epithelial cells rather than nematocytes (Fig 6A–6C), suggesting their role as lineage-restricted stem/progenitor cells while maintaining the potential to become neurons in the regenerating tentacle (S10 Fig). Such stem-like cells also accumulate at the newly formed branch starting at 48 to 72 hpa (Fig 4Bii–4iii), consistent with the prediction by the previous report proposing that i-cell population in the branching bud differs from RHSCs in the bulb [39]. While previous studies using other cnidarians have described active cell proliferation upon injuries, these proliferating cells are pluri/multipotent stem cells migrating to the injury site [20,21,27,64], not lineage-restricted stem/progenitor cells like RSPCs. Altogether, our findings support the heterogeneity of stem-like cells inCladonemajellyfish (Fig 7A), which is similar to the subpopulations ofHydrai-cells [54,65]. Our work is the first to provide evidence that RSPCs, which exhibit preferential differentiation into epithelial cells, appear upon injury in cnidarians, but how this cell population is supplied remains unknown. Nucleoside pulse-chase experiments, together with the elimination of RHSCs, show that blastema formation is mostly independent of RHSCs in the bulb (Figs4andS6). When the distal side of the tentacle, where few proliferating cells exist, is amputated, local cell proliferation is still observed around the injury site (Fig 2G). These observations raise 2 possibilities: mitotic re-entry of quiescent/slow-cycling stem cells or dedifferentiation from differentiated cells into stem-like cells. Previous reports have shown that some cnidarian species possess quiescent or slow-cycling stem cells. For example, whileHydrahas 3 types of adult stem cells—i-cells, epidermal stem cells, and gastrodermis epithelial stem cells—the subpopulation of each stem cell is slow-cycling [54]. These slow-cycling cells are resistant to hydroxyurea treatment due to G2 phase arrest and re-enter the cell cycle during head regeneration.Nematostellaalso has slow-cycling/quiescent cells that are predominantly present in the mesenteries and are resistant to X-ray irradiation, and these cells’ cell cycle is activated upon injury, when they migrate toward the wound site [21]. Given that a small number of i-cells exist in theCladonemaintact tentacle, outside the bulb, and branching bud (Figs3C,S3A,S3C, S3D,S4A and S4B) [39]; such a minor population of i-cells may behave as slow-cycling/quiescent cells and re-enter the cell cycle in response to injury. By contrast, although cnidarian dedifferentiation potential is still debated, some species appear to exhibit context-dependent cellular plasticity [66]. For example, classical experiments using the hydrozoan jellyfishPodocoryna carneahave indicated their dedifferentiation potential in vitro: when isolated striated muscles are cultured after collagenase treatment, the muscle cells dedifferentiate into stem-like cells and re-differentiate into multiple cell types [67]. Additionally, in greenHydra, the isolated gastrodermis, which is i-cell free, can reconstitute a complete polyp including the epidermis [68]. In this case, gastrodermal gland cells appear to dedifferentiate into i-cells [69], while gastrodermal digestive cells transdifferentiate into epidermal epitheliomuscular cells [70]. Moreover, a recent report usingHydractiniahas shown that, when the hypostome is isolated from the body, cellular reprogramming triggered by cell senescence occurs in somatic cells, which convert into pluripotentPiwi1+i-cells [71]. Although these reports support the possibility that dedifferentiation produces pluri/multipotent stem cells after isolation from the body, it is also possible that RSPCs are derived from their descendant cell types. During newt limb regeneration, cellular lineage is restricted such that muscle progenitors dedifferentiated from resident muscle fibers produce only muscles [7,72]. Given that RSPCs in theCladonematentacle mainly differentiate into epithelial cells (Fig 6A–6C), epithelial cells may dedifferentiate into progenitors that give rise to epithelial cells in the newly formed tentacle. Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms of animal regeneration have been addressed in detail using representative species such as planaria and salamanders, questions such as the evolutionary history of regeneration and the homology of regeneration mechanisms across species remain largely unknown. Repair-specific stem cells, or RSPCs, provided by quiescent stem cells and/or dedifferentiation are common blastema components in bilaterian appendage regeneration [3,73]. As in vertebrates where lineage-restricted repair-specific stem/progenitor cells participate in appendage regeneration [7,9,11], the protostome ecdysozoaParhyale hawaiensisutilize re-activation of muscle satellite cells during thoracic leg regeneration [74]. By contrast, during echinoderm starfish arm regeneration, dedifferentiated dermal cells form blastema-like structures [75]. Similarly, during insect cricket leg regeneration, the source of blastemal cells is derived from injury-induced dedifferentiation [76,77]. These reports suggest that repair-specific production of blastema cells is relatively conserved throughout bilaterians (Fig 7B). In non-bilaterian metazoans, resident pluripotent stem cells are thought to contribute to both homeostasis and whole-body regeneration. During the regeneration of the demosponge in Porifera, one of the most primitive animals, archeocytes known as homeostatic stem cells contribute to an undifferentiated cell mass beneath the wound as a blastema-like structure [78]. While the regenerating ctenophore cydippids do not apparently form blastema-like structure, slow-cycling stem-like cells are recruited to the injury site [79]. In cnidarians, resident stem cells, which are involved in homeostasis, are recruited to the injury site after amputation of the body and removal of the organs [19–21,27]. By contrast, as shown in this study, the main cellular source of blastemal cells is not RHSCs but rather RSPCs duringCladonematentacle regeneration (Fig 4). Our findings suggest that, in terms of the regeneration processes and blastemal cellular source, the regeneration mechanism of theCladonematentacle is more similar to that of bilaterian species (Fig 7B). One important remaining question is whether bilaterians’ and cnidarians’ most recent common ancestor possessed a system to supply blastema through repair-specific stem/proliferative cells. Although sponges and ctenophores have been proposed to possess dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation potentials that can provide a cellular source of regenerated bodies [66], it is currently unknown whether they are repair-specific cell populations or not. In this study, we identify RSPCs that contribute to the newly generated epithelium duringCladonematentacle regeneration. Intriguingly, recent genomic studies have revealed that jellyfish-specific genes are not conserved among bilaterians or even other cnidarians including corals and sea anemones, and the anthozoanNematostellais the most “bilaterian-like” cnidarian sequenced [80–82]. These findings raise the possibility that medusozoans had evolved the medusa stage after branching from their common ancestor and that bilaterians and cnidarian jellyfish likely independently acquired a similar mechanism of blastema formation upon amputation of appendages. It is thus tempting to speculate that blastema formation by RSPCs is a common feature acquired for complex organ and appendage regeneration during animal evolution. Given the current lack of knowledge concerning the exact cell cycle and the inherent heterogeneity ofCladonemai-cells, it is plausible that a subset of i-cells located at the bulb, not marked by 24 h EdU uptake, may become activated after amputation and contribute to blastema formation. Furthermore, the cellular origins of RSPCs in the blastema remain elusive, with at least 2 conceivable scenarios: mitotic re-entry of quiescent stem cells and/or dedifferentiation of neighboring specialized cells. Due to the current constraints imposed by available tools and techniques, addressing these issues is challenging at this stage. Looking forward, it is essential to introduce genetic tools that allow the tracing of specific cell lineages and the manipulation of genes inCladonema. This approach promises to deepen our understanding of jellyfish development and regeneration at the molecular and cellular levels and also to enhance the utility ofCladonemaas a more useful research model.

PLOS is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, #C2354500, based in San Francisco, California, US","At about the size of a pinkie nail, the jellyfish speciesCladonemacan regenerate an amputated tentacle in two to three days — but how? Regenerating functional tissue across species, including salamanders and insects, relies on the ability to form a blastema, a clump of undifferentiated cells that can repair damage and grow into the missing appendage. Jellyfish, along with other cnidarians such as corals and sea anemones, exhibit high regeneration abilities, but how they form the critical blastema has remained a mystery until now.
A research team based in Japan has revealed that stem-like proliferative cells — which are actively growing and dividing but not yet differentiating into specific cell types — appear at the site of injury and help form the blastema.
The findings were published in the scientific journalPLOS Biology.
“Importantly, these stem-like proliferative cells in blastema are different from the resident stem cells localized in the tentacle,” said corresponding author Yuichiro Nakajima, lecturer in the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Tokyo. “Repair-specific proliferative cells mainly contribute to the epithelium — the thin outer layer — of the newly formed tentacle.”
The resident stem cells that exist in and near the tentacle are responsible for generating all cellular lineages during homeostasis and regeneration, meaning they maintain and repair whatever cells are needed during the jellyfish’s lifetime, according to Nakajima. Repair-specific proliferative cells only appear at the time of injury.
“Together, resident stem cells and repair-specific proliferative cells allow rapid regeneration of the functional tentacle within a few days,” Nakajima said, noting that jellyfish use their tentacles to hunt and feed.
This finding informs how researchers understand how blastema formation differs among different animal groups, according to first author Sosuke Fujita, a postdoctoral researcher in the same lab as Nakajima in the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
“In this study, our aim was to address the mechanism of blastema formation, using the tentacle of cnidarian jellyfishCladonemaas a regenerative model in non-bilaterians, or animals that do not form bilaterally — or left-right — during embryonic development,” Fujita said, explaining that the work may provide insight from an evolutionary perspective.
Salamanders, for example, are bilaterian animals capable of regenerating limbs. Their limbs contain stem cells restricted to specific cell-type needs, a process that appears to operate similarly to the repair-specific proliferative cells observed in the jellyfish.
“Given that repair-specific proliferative cells are analogues to the restricted stem cells in bilaterian salamander limbs, we can surmise that blastema formation by repair-specific proliferative cells is a common feature independently acquired for complex organ and appendage regeneration during animal evolution,” Fujita said.
The cellular origins of the repair-specific proliferative cells observed in the blastema remain unclear, though, and the researchers say the currently available tools to investigate the origins are too limited to elucidate the source of those cells or to identify other, different stem-like cells.
“It would be essential to introduce genetic tools that allow the tracing of specific cell lineages and the manipulation inCladonema,” Nakajima said. “Ultimately, understanding blastema formation mechanisms in regenerative animals, including jellyfish, may help us identify cellular and molecular components that improve our own regenerative abilities.”

Quantum batteries break causality,"In the standard quantum theory, the causal order of occurrence between events is prescribed, and must be definite. This has been maintained in all conventional scenarios of operation for quantum batteries. In this study we take a step further to allow the charging of quantum batteries in an indefinite causal order (ICO). We propose a nonunitary dynamics-based charging protocol and experimentally investigate this using a photonic quantum switch. Our results demonstrate that both the amount of energy charged and the thermal efficiency can be boosted simultaneously. Moreover, we reveal a counterintuitive effect that a relatively less powerful charger guarantees a charged battery with more energy at a higher efficiency. Through investigation of different charger configurations, we find that ICO protocol can outperform the conventional protocols and gives rise to the anomalous inverse interaction effect. Our findings highlight a fundamental difference between the novelties arising from ICO and other coherently controlled processes, providing new insights into ICO and its potential applications.

For the first time, researchers including those from the University of Tokyo take advantage of an unintuitive quantum process that disregards the conventional notion of causality to improve the performance of so-called quantum batteries, bringing this future technology a little closer to reality.
When you hear the word “quantum,” the physics governing the subatomic world, developments in quantum computers tend to steal the headlines, but there are other upcoming quantum technologies worth paying attention to. One such item is the quantum battery which, though initially puzzling in name, holds unexplored potential for sustainable energy solutions and possible integration into future electric vehicles. Nevertheless, these new devices are poised to find use in various portable and low-power applications, especially when opportunities to recharge are scarce.
At present, quantum batteries only exist as laboratory experiments, and researchers around the world are working on the different aspects that are hoped to one day combine into a fully functioning and practical application. Graduate student Yuanbo Chen and Associate Professor Yoshihiko Hasegawa from the Department of Information and Communication Engineering at the University of Tokyo are investigating the best way to charge a quantum battery, and this is where time comes into play. One of the advantages of quantum batteries is that they should be incredibly efficient, but that hinges on the way they are charged.
“Current batteries for low-power devices, such as smartphones or sensors, typically use chemicals such as lithium to store charge, whereas a quantum battery uses microscopic particles like arrays of atoms,” said Chen. “While chemical batteries are governed by classical laws of physics, microscopic particles are quantum in nature, so we have a chance to explore ways of using them that bend or even break our intuitive notions of what takes place at small scales. I’m particularly interested in the way quantum particles can work to violate one of our most fundamental experiences, that of time.”
In collaboration with researcher Gaoyan Zhu and Professor Peng Xue from Beijing Computational Science Research Center, the team experimented with ways to charge a quantum battery using optical apparatuses such as lasers, lenses and mirrors, but the way they achieved it necessitated a quantum effect where events are not causally connected the way everyday things are. Earlier methods to charge a quantum battery involved a series of charging stages one after the other. However, here, the team instead used a novel quantum effect they call indefinite causal order, or ICO. In the classical realm, causality follows a clear path, meaning that if event A leads to event B, then the possibility of B causing A is excluded. However, at the quantum scale, ICO allows both directions of causality to exist in what’s known as a quantum superposition, where both can be simultaneously true.
“With ICO, we demonstrated that the way you charge a battery made up of quantum particles could drastically impact its performance,” said Chen. “We saw huge gains in both the energy stored in the system and the thermal efficiency. And somewhat counterintuitively, we discovered the surprising effect of an interaction that’s the inverse of what you might expect: A lower-power charger could provide higher energies with greater efficiency than a comparably higher-power charger using the same apparatus.”
The phenomenon of ICO the team explored could find uses beyond charging a new generation of low-power devices. The underlying principles, including the inverse interaction effect uncovered here, could improve the performance of other tasks involving thermodynamics or processes that involve the transfer of heat. One promising example is solar panels, where heat effects can reduce their efficiency, but ICO could be used to mitigate those and lead to gains in efficiency instead.

In the present study, we conducted a large-scale, cross-ancestry meta-analysis of PUD combining genome-wide association studies with Japanese and European studies (52,032 cases and 905,344 controls), and discovered 25 new loci highly concordant across ancestries. An examination of GU and DU genetic architecture demonstrated that GUs shared the same risk loci as DUs, although with smaller genetic effect sizes and higher polygenicity than DUs, indicating higher heterogeneity of GUs.Helicobacter pylori(HP)-stratified analysis found an HP-related host genetic locus. Integrative analyses using bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiles highlighted the genetic factors of PUD being enriched in the highly expressed genes in stomach tissues, especially in somatostatin-producing D cells. Our results provide genetic evidence that gastrointestinal cell differentiations and hormone regulations are critical in PUD etiology. PUD refers to the acid-induced injury of the digestive tract, occurring mainly in the stomach (GU) or proximal segment of the duodenum (DU) with bleeding, perforation or gastric outlet obstruction as the major complication. PUD is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, with a lifetime prevalence rate of approximately 5–10% in the general population1. The prevalence of PUD has been reported to be substantially higher in east Asians (EAS) than Europeans (EUR)1, with GU being more common than DU in the Japanese population and DU being more common in Europeans2. With HP infection and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being two of the most common causes of GUs and DUs3, genetic factors also play a critical role in the development of PUD4. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of PUD had identified multiple loci, mainly HP related, in Europeans5,6. Given the relatively high prevalence of PUD and HP infection in east Asians and the remarkably limited number of risk loci identified in east Asian populations2,7, GWASs with a larger sample size of EAS ancestry individuals would be required to enhance our understanding of genetic etiology of PUD. As GUs and DUs differ in various aspects, such as the proportion of ulcers that are attributable to HP infection8, the genetic differences across PUD subtypes and the key cell types involved in their etiology should be investigated. Epidemiological studies have suggested that DU is a protective factor against gastric cancer (GC)9. However, whether genetic factors for PUD and GC are concordant and can explain the epidemiological findings remain unclear. Therefore, we anticipated that large-scale genetic studies of PUD could not only expand our understanding of PUD biology but also provide insights into the genetic factors that interact with HP or lead to different outcomes of PUD or GC, potentially enabling a more accurate prediction of individual risk in clinical settings. To address these issues, we conducted a large east Asian-specific and cross-ancestry genome-wide analysis of PUD and PUD subtypes along with four Japanese studies and two European cohorts totaling 52,032 PUD cases and 905,344 controls. We conducted a three-stage genome-wide analysis of PUD and its subtypes. An overview of the workflow is provided in Fig.1and Supplementary Fig.1. PUD cases in the east Asian populations were obtained by combining individuals with any of the two major PUD subtypes (DU and GU), which were classified based on the anatomical sites where peptic ulcers occurred. Individuals with comorbidities of GU and DU were classified as BU (both GU and DU) cases (Methods, Supplementary Fig.2and Supplementary Table1). The 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (1KG Phase 3). BBJ1-180K consists of approximately 180,000 individuals from BBJ1. BBJ1-12K consists of approximately 12,000 individuals from BBJ1. BBJ2-42K consists of approximately 42,000 individuals from BBJ2. TMM-50K consists of approximately 50,000 individuals from Tohoku Medical Megabank. First, we performed GWASs of PUD and PUD subtypes (DU, GU and BU) in the discovery stage on the BioBank Japan first cohort (BBJ1)10-180,000 (180K) dataset (Methods). The dataset included 19,713 cases of PUD and 153,178 controls of east Asian ancestry and was imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (ref.11) (1KG Phase 3) reference panel. A total of 13,846,852 variants (minor allele count (MAC) >20 andR2> 0.3) were tested in east Asians for association with a generalized linear mixed model using SAIGE12, which controls for the case–control imbalance (case-to-control ratios ranged from 1:7.7 to 1:82 in BBJ1-180K; Supplementary Table1). For PUD, ten genome-wide significant loci (P< 5.0 × 10−8) were identified, five of which had not been reported as genome-wide significant loci in previous GWASs of PUD or any subtype. In addition, 14 loci reached the significance threshold for DU, including 7 new loci (3 of which overlapped with new PUD loci). One previously reported locus atPSCA2was identified for GU and BU. A total of 15 nonoverlapping genetic loci (Methods) reached the significance threshold for PUD or any subtype, of which 9 were new (Supplementary Table2and Supplementary Fig.3). Analysis of the X chromosome identified one known locus atGUCY2F7for PUD, DU and GU (Supplementary Table3). Thirteen nonoverlapping significant loci were identified in sex-stratified analysis (thirteen for men and one for women; Supplementary Table3). Replication was conducted in individuals from three independent studies, namely BBJ1-12K (1,001 cases), BBJ2-42K (3,637 cases) and TMM13-50K (a population-based study (5,388 cases); Supplementary Table1andMethods). The replication datasets were imputed using the 1KG Phase 3 panel and tested for associations of autosomal variants with the same settings as in discovery GWASs. Among the nine new lead variants associated with PUD or subtypes, four were nominally associated (P< 0.05) with PUD or its subtypes in the same direction in at least two replication datasets. Notably, five new loci were replicated in the population-based dataset (P< 0.05 in the same direction; Supplementary Table4). Next, we performed an east Asian-specific meta-analysis combining the discovery GWASs and three replication GWASs (ncase= 29,739;ncontrol= 240,675). Fixed-effect meta-analyses using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method were performed for PUD and PUD subtypes. The genomic inflation factors (λgc) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSC)14intercepts ranged from 1.03 to 1.08 and from 1.01 to 1.02, respectively (Supplementary Table5), indicating no substantial bias. In the EAS-specific meta-analysis, we detected 25 nonoverlapping risk loci associated with PUD or any subtype, including 11 additional new loci (Table1, Supplementary Fig.4and Supplementary Table6). Finally, we collected publicly available European GWASs of PUD and its subtypes using samples from FinnGen and UK Biobank (UKB)5,12,15(Supplementary Table7). After quality control (QC) and harmonization (Methods), a fixed-effect, IVW, cross-ancestry meta-analysis (52,032 cases of PUD and 905,344 controls) was performed, combining the Japanese and European studies. Six additional loci for PUD and DU reached the genome-wide significance level (P< 5.0 × 10−8; Table1, Fig.2, Supplementary Table8and Supplementary Fig.5). Furthermore, we performed a cross-ancestry meta-regression utilizing MR-MEGA (Meta-Regression of Multi-AncEstry Genetic Association)16and identified 23 known and described new loci mentioned above in the east Asian-specific and cross-ancestry meta-analyses (Supplementary Table9). In total, we identified 25 nonoverlapping new loci for PUD and its subtypes in the east Asian-specific and cross-ancestry meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig.6), although one new locus identified in the discovery stage was not significant in any of the meta-analyses (Supplementary Table2). Two-sidedPvalues were derived from the cross-ancestry meta-analysis of 52,032 cases and 905,344 controls of EAS or EUR ancestry. Meta-analysis was performed using the IVW method under the fixed-effect model. For variants above the top light-gray dashed line (−log10(P) > 20), values are rescaled. Lead variants are annotated with the nearest gene name(s). New loci are highlighted in red. Variants are plotted against GRCh37 (hg19). The bottom dark-gray dashed line indicates the genome-wide significance threshold (P< 5.0 × 10−8). Variants with −log10(P) < 2 were omitted. With the large available datasets for PUD and its subtypes in EAS, we investigated the shared and distinct risk loci for PUD in EAS and EUR individuals. We compared the per-allele effect sizes of lead variants associated with PUD or any of the subtypes available for both ancestries (Methods). The effect sizes for PUD showed a relatively high correlation (27 variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01 in both populations;r= 0.79) between the two ancestries, although we detected 9 variants (9 out of 27 effect-size differences (difference in log(odds ratio (OR)) > 0.05); Fig.3aand Supplementary Table10). The high correlation remained after the winner’s curse (WC) corrections (Methods, Supplementary Table11and Supplementary Fig.7). To further examine the difference in genetic architecture of PUD between east Asians and Europeans, we conducted a cross-ancestry genetic correlation analysis using Popcorn17(Methods). The genetic impact was significantly different from 1 (null hypothesis:ρgi= 1) for PUD (Fig.3b; genetic impact correlationρgi= 0.65,P= 3.0 × 10−4), indicating the difference in genetic architecture of PUD across ancestries. For the subtypes, effect sizes for DU showed a higher correlation (r= 0.79) across ancestries compared with that for GU (r= 0.63; Supplementary Fig.8and Supplementary Table10). The genetic correlation of GU was relatively low (ρgi= 0.45,P= 7.3 × 10−3), whereas the genetic architecture of DU did not show a significant difference across ancestries (ρgi= 0.72,P= 9.6 × 10−2; Supplementary Table12). a, Per-allele effect-size (logarithm of ORs) comparison using east Asian-specific and European-specific summary statistics for PUD.

Two-sidedPvalues were derived from the ancestry-specific meta-analyses. The most significant associations were shown if overlapping variants existed (interval <500 kb).

To explore the secondary signals at the identified loci, we conducted a stepwise conditional analysis using COJO18with an in-sample LD reference for EAS (Methods). We detected four additional independent signals reaching genome-wide significance (P< 5.0 × 10−8) for PUD and three independent signals at thePSCAlocus for DU (Supplementary Table13). ThePSCAlocus had the largest number of independent associations (three for PUD, four for DU and two for GU and BU). Near theCDX2andGASTloci, two of the previously reported loci in European individuals5, we detected independent signals atPDX1(Fig.4a) andJUP2(Fig.4b) loci, respectively (Supplementary Tables13and14). a, Regional plot atPDX1–CDX2locus for PUD association from east Asian-specific meta-analysis.

We conducted a fine-mapping analysis using SuSiE19to identify the causal variants. We searched for nonsynonymous variants in 95% credible sets to link the disease-associated loci to potential alteration of protein functions. A total of ten nonsynonymous variants at six nonoverlapping loci were identified, six of which were in new loci for PUD and its subtypes (Supplementary Table15). Of those, rs2233580 (PAX4; p.R200H; combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD)20score = 29.8) was also associated with type 2 diabetes. The variant was common (MAF > 0.05) in 1KG EAS but almost monozygotic in non-EAS populations. Rs4745 (EFNA1; p.D159V; posterior inclusion probability (PIP) = 0.05 for DU; CADD score = 15.2) was common in EAS and EUR and associated with GC. This was the lead variant ofcis-splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) forEFNA1in the stomach and was in high LD with rs4072037 (ref.21) (lead sQTL variant forMUC1in the stomach; LDr2= 0.74 in 1KG EAS). In addition to the missense variants, we found rs4390169 in the credible set (upstream ofEFNA1; PIP = 0.06 for DU;in high LD with rs4745, LDr2= 0.99 in 1KG EAS and EUR) to be the lead variant ofcis-protein QTL (pQTL) in plasma forEFNA1(ref.22). In the credible sets of previously reportedABOandFUT2loci for PUD2,5, we identified rs8176719 (lead variant atABOlocus) and rs1047781 (in the credible sets atFUT2locus; PIP = 0.63). Deletion of rs8176719 resulted in the O-allele, whereas rs1047781 (p.I140F) was an EAS-specific common variant (MAF = 0.439 in 1KG EAS) and its A-allele determined the FUT2 secretor status. We performed a logistic regression analysis to investigate the correlation of ABO blood group and FUT2 secretor status with PUD. Blood group O (OR = 1.14,P= 6.0 × 10−14) and nonsecretor status (OR = 1.17,P= 2.9 × 10−11) were significantly correlated with a higher risk of PUD, which was consistent for all PUD subtypes (Supplementary Table16). To investigate the potential interactions between blood group O and nonsecretor status, logistic regression analysis including an interaction term was performed. However, significant interactions (P< 0.05/8, Bonferroni’s correction) were not detected between blood group O and nonsecretor status (Supplementary Table17). To detect the functionally relevant genes, we searched the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v.8 datasets21for overlap of leadcis-expression QTLs (eQTLs) with PUD signals or their LD proxies (LDr2> 0.6 in 1KG EAS or EUR)23. The most significant eQTL hits for a gene within each tissue type were interpreted (Supplementary Fig.9). We identified an overlap of new variants with eQTLs associated withIHH,PLCL2,PTGER4,ZNF322,HIATL1,FAM211BandGGT1in the stomach. We searched five recent large-scale pQTL datasets22,24,25,26,27from serum or plasma for overlap ofcis- ortrans-pQTL with PUD signals or their LD proxies. We observed overlaps with 88 unique significant pQTL associations, most of which (93.1%) weretrans-pQTL and involved the lead SNP at theABOlocus (Supplementary Table18). Thecis-pQTL alleles in LD with PUD risk alleles were associated with increased levels of EFNA1 and OBP2B, and decreased levels of NHEJ1, ABO and GGT1 (thecis-pQTLs overlapped with thecis-eQTLs mentioned above forEFNA1, OBP2B, NHEJ1andGGT1). Fortrans-pQTLs in LD with the lead variants, we observed links with multiple proteins, including F8, F10, PROS1 (blood coagulation related) and trefoil factor family peptides (which play important roles in response to gastrointestinal mucosal injury). Additional analysis suggested plausible proteins and pathways (Supplementary Noteand Supplementary Table19). We conducted cross-trait LD score regression28to evaluate the genetic correlation across PUD-related traits (Fig.5aand Supplementary Table20). DU and GU showed significantly high genetic correlations (rg= 0.79, false discovery rate (FDR) <5%) with each other, as expected. Although not statistically significant (FDR < 5%), GU showed a positive genetic correlation with GC (rg= 0.17), whereas DU was negatively correlated (rg= −0.14). We also investigated the genetic correlation of PUD with dietary habits29and complex traits in BBJ30,31(Methods); no significant genetic correlation was observed between PUD and other complex traits in EAS (FDR < 5%; Supplementary Figs.10–12and Supplementary Table21). a, Genetic correlation among PUD, PUD-related phenotypes and risk factors. *Two-sidedP< 0.05; **FDR < 5%.

GC summary statistics were obtained from previous GWASs conducted in BBJ1. Inb–d, data are presented as effect-size estimates (log(OR)) ± s.e.m. To investigate the pleiotropic effects of distinct variants, we performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) lookup using previous large-scale GWASs in a Japanese population7. Among the 27 available lead variants associated with PUD and its subtypes, 16 reached the genome-wide significance threshold for at least one trait (P< 5.0 × 10−8). From them, 12 variants were associated with at least 2 traits after Bonferroni’s correction (P< 8.6 × 10−6; Supplementary Figs.13–15and Supplementary Table22). Both type 2 diabetes (two atSND1–PAX4locus and one atGASTlocus) and GC (EFNA1,PTGER4andPSCAloci) shared three significant variants after Bonferroni’s correction (P< 8.6 × 10−6) with PUD or its subtypes (Supplementary Fig.16). To examine the differences in genetic architectures between HP-induced and HP-unrelated peptic ulcers, we conducted HP-stratified association tests for PUD in HP+and HP−individuals from TMM-50K (Methodsand Supplementary Table23). For the distinct PUD signals identified in the EAS population (29 variants with MAF > 0.01), per-allele effect sizes for PUD between HP−and HP+status were highly correlated (Fig.5b; slope = 0.84, s.e.m. = 0.07,r= 0.91; Supplementary Fig.17and Supplementary Table24). We identified one lead SNP (rs12792379), specifically associated with HP+PUD, atCCKBR(OR = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05–1.34 for HP+PUD; OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.92–0.11 for HP−PUD) and one HP−GU locus nearZNF169(rs12347577; Cochran’sQtest,Phet< 0.05). On the other hand, the lead variants in the most significant locus atPSCAdid not show significant heterogeneity in effect sizes (Phet< 0.05). Colocalization analysis suggested that HP+PUD and HP−PUD shared the causal variant inPSCA(PP4 > 0.8 for PUD; Supplementary Table25). To further explore the similarities and differences of genetic architecture between GU and DU, we first compared the effect sizes of distinct signals identified in east Asians (lead variants and independent secondary variants) for GU and DU (Fig.5cand Supplementary Fig.18). Notably, the effect sizes for GU showed a strong correlation with those for DU (29 variants with MAF > 0.01,r= 0.92), which was concordant with the high genetic correlations described above. However, the effect sizes for GU were systematically smaller than those for DU (intercept = 0.01, slope = 0.43 and s.e.m.slope= 0.03), with 19 variants (19 of 29 = 65.5%) showing significant heterogeneity (Phet< 0.05) in Cochran’sQtest (Supplementary Table26). To further verify the findings and avoid potential biases for the comparisons, we compared (1) the effect sizes of distinct signals of GWASs in TMM-50K, FinnGen15and UKB12, (2) the effect sizes generated by excluding BU samples in the association tests in BBJ1-180K (that is, no common case in the comparison) and (3) TMM-50K-derived statistics with BBJ1-180K-derived statistics (that is, no common control in the comparison). In any of these comparisons, GU showed high correlation (for variants with MAF > 0.01,r= 0.75–0.90) with DU, although with smaller effect sizes than DU (Supplementary Figs.19–21and Supplementary Tables27–29). Furthermore, we utilized SBasyesS32to estimate the SNP heritability and polygenicity (defined as the proportion of SNPs with nonzero effects) using HapMap3 (ref.33) SNPs from EAS-specific summary statistics (Methods). Approximately 0.22% of the variants were estimated to have nonzero effects for PUD. Compared with DU, GU showed moderately higher polygenicity but lower heritability (PiGU= 0.24%, PiDU= 0.10%; Supplementary Figs.22–23and Supplementary Table30). The results demonstrated that GU and DU showed a high genetic correlation with most risk loci shared and suggested higher heterogeneity of GU34. Finally, using the summary statistics derived from TMM-50K, we generated polygenic risk score (PRS) models with PRS-CS35comprising 1,029,637 variants and tested the PRS in BBJ1-180K for associations with PUD or PUD subtypes to investigate the genetic overlap among PUD and PUD subtypes. Compared with HP+PRS, HP−PRS generally showed stronger associations with PUD or PUD subtypes. The strongest association was between DU PRS and DU (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.20–1.25, ΔR2= 0.94%). DU PRS (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.06–1.10, ΔR2= 0.13%) showed a stronger association with GU than GU PRS (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06, ΔR2= 0.05%; Supplementary Table31). The results further validated that GU shares risk loci with DU while having higher heterogeneity than the latter. Considering that DU appears to be a protective factor against GC, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR)36to evaluate the causality of PUD or its subtypes on GC. Summary statistics for GC in EAS were obtained from a previous study in BBJ1-180K, which included approximately 6,500 cases30(Methods). Summary statistics for PUD and its subtypes were obtained by conducting a meta-analysis combing three replication datasets. Although PUD and its subtypes showed significant (P< 0.05/15, Bonferroni’s correction) protective effects against GC using the IVW method (Supplementary Table32), MR-Egger analysis suggested significant pleiotropy for the instruments (Supplementary Table33). MR-PRESSO37was utilized to correct for the horizontal pleiotropic variants (ranging from six to seven for each exposure). The outlier-corrected MR showed no significant effects of PUD or its subtypes on GC (Supplementary Table34). We note that splitting samples and removing outliers may cause power loss (Supplementary Fig.24). To evaluate the pleiotropic effects of PUD risk variants on GC risk, we compared the effect sizes of distinct signals in EAS between PUD subtypes and GC. For 23 available variants existing in both datasets, we found the effect sizes for DU to be negatively correlated with that for GC (slope = −0.33, s.e.m.slope= 0.10; Fig.5d, Supplementary Table35and Supplementary Fig.25). It was noteworthy that lead variants linked toEFNA1(encoding Ephrin A1, a member of the EFN family),PTGER4(encoding the receptor for prostaglandin E2) andPSCAshowed relatively strong but opposite effects on DU and GC(Supplementary Table35). This suggested that the alleles of these variants, which increased the risk for PUD, could decrease the risk for GC. When removing the three variants from the regression, negative correlation was not observed for the 20 variants (slope = −0.06, s.e.m.slope= 0.10; Supplementary Fig.25), indicating that negative correlation between DU and GC was largely affected by the three variants. Gene-level analysis using MAGMA38,39(Methods) detected 29 genes significantly associated with PUD (P< 6.5 × 10−7; Supplementary Table36), 45 genes associated with DU and 15 genes associated with GU, in the EAS population. In total, 47 distinct genes were associated with PUD or PUD subtypes. Multiple genes identified in gene-level analysis were reportedly related to GC (PTGER4(ref.40),PRKAA1(ref.41),GNAQ42,GNAS43,NHEJ1(ref.44),IHH45andJUP46). Based on the gene-level statistics, we additionally performed pathway enrichment analysis and identified one gene set after Bonferroni’s correction (nikolsky_breast_cancer_8q23_q24_amplicon, including genes within amplicon 8q23-q24 identified in a study of breast tumors47;P< 8.0 × 10−7; Supplementary Table37). We tested the tissue-level specificity employing MAGMA39with GTEx v.8 datasets21in EAS individuals to investigate the tissue types related to PUD and its subtypes. Significant genetic enrichments (FDR < 5%) were observed in the stomach, pancreas, small intestine and kidney for PUD, in the stomach, pancreas and prostate for DU and in the stomach for GU (Fig.6aand Supplementary Table38). a, Associations across PU phenotypes and 30 general tissue types analyzed using MAGMA with east Asian-specific summary statistics and the GTEx v.8 dataset.

Ina,bandc, the red bars imply significant associations after corrections for each analysis (FDR < 5%). Only the ten most significant associations for each phenotype are shown. To further characterize specific cell types associated with PUD in the gastric and duodenal tissues, we utilized publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of the human stomach and duodenum48. We performed cell-specificity analysis using LDSC49and MAGMA in EAS and EUR individuals, respectively (Methods). To increase statistical power, we conducted a fixed-effect meta-analysis combining EAS and EUR results for each method (Methodsand Supplementary Figs.26–31). For PUD, we found that stomach D cells reached the significance threshold (FDR < 5%) in the analyses of both MAGMA and LDSC (Fig.6b,cand Supplementary Tables39and40). In addition, duodenal enterochromaffin cells (EC cells), stomach antral EC cells and stomach tuft cells were significantly (FDR < 5%) associated with PUD, as per MAGMA (Fig.6b). Somatostatin produced by stomach D cells inhibits the secretion of a variety of gastrointestinal hormones, including the gastrin secreted by stomach G cells which stimulates gastric acid secretion. EC cells secrete serotonin (5-HT, a neurotransmitter) with diverse gastrointestinal functions and tuft cells (chemosensory epithelial cells) secrete interleukin-25, driving the type 2 immune response to parasitic infection. Together, the findings suggested the important role of gastrointestinal hormone regulation and immune response in PUD etiology. Our GWAS meta-analyses of PUD and PUD subtypes discovered 33 autosomal susceptibility loci, of which 25 had not been reported in previous GWASs (19 in east Asian-specific analysis and 6 in cross-ancestry analysis). The loci were mostly shared across ancestries with strong correlations of effect sizes. Our cross-ancestry analysis emphasized the high genetic correlation of DU and suggested the heterogeneity of GU across ancestries. The larger effect sizes ofMUC1andMUC6in populations of EUR ancestry are in reasonable agreement with their critical roles in the protection from NSAID-induced injury, given the much lower prevalence of HP infection in western countries compared with that in east Asian populations50. Multiple new loci (PAX4(ref.51),PDX1(ref.52),IHH53andSLC22A3(ref.54)) and reported loci (CCKBR,CDX2andGAST) were found to be related to cell differentiation or gastrin signaling. By integrating scRNA-seq datasets, we identified the association of PUD with certain hormone-secreting cells, including stomach D cells (somatostatin) and stomach antral and duodenal EC cells (5-HT). The potential roles of D cells and EC cells are discussed inSupplementary Note. Our results also showed the signal atCCKBR(encoding the receptor for gastrin) to be HP+specific. The PUD risk allele of the lead SNP (rs12792379) is in LD with the eQTL allele associated with higherCCKBRexpression in multiple tissues21, including esophagus mucosa. It has been widely shown that HP-elicited cytokines stimulate gastrin release55. It is likely that the increased gastrin level induced by HP will interact with altered expression inCCKBR, leading to dysregulated gastric acid secretion and altered susceptibility to apoptosis56,57. Taken together, our results provided genetic evidence of gastrointestinal cell differentiation and hormone regulation being critical in PUD etiology. As expected, we observed high genetic correlation between GU and DU and nominally significant genetic correlations between PUD and its risk factors (Supplementary Note); effect-size comparisons demonstrated that GU shared risk loci with DU, but had smaller effect sizes than DU. Polygenicity of GU was higher than that of DU. SNP-based heritability estimate for DU (liability scaled) was almost twice as high as for GU. In addition, DU PRS showed a stronger association with GU than GU PRS in east Asians. The results revealed the genetic difference between GU and DU and reflected a higher heterogeneity of GU58,59,60. We found three variants (linked toEFNA1,PTGER4andPSCA) to have relatively large pleiotropic effects on DU and GC. EFNA1 suppresses tumor growth whereas PGE2 supports tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis40,61. PUD risk alleles resulted in increased levels of EFNA1 and reduced levels ofPTGER4, whereas GC risk alleles were associated with a decreased level of EFNA1 and an increased level ofPTGER4. This suggested that the risk alleles of variants atEFNA1andPTGER4for GC (nonrisk alleles for PUD) potentially benefited peptic ulcer healing while imposing an increased risk for GC through upregulated cell proliferation and angiogenesis. In addition, we also detected multiple PUD risk, cancer-related genes (for example,IHH,GNAS,NHEJ1,JUPandMECOM), which provided potential targets contributing to the different outcomes of PUD or GC. No causal effects were identified in the outlier-corrected MR in the present study, which may suffer from the power loss caused by sample split and removal of variants. Further research is warranted on the protective role of DU against GC. Although we identified multiple associations, the present study has several potential limitations. First, the phenotypic information of PUD and subtypes was obtained via interviews and reviews of medical records. However, the prevalence rate of PUD was consistent with that in previous epidemiological studies; our study replicated most of the previously identified loci and the new biological findings are feasible, which suggested the relatively high reliability of the results. Second, due to the lack of information about the chronological order of PUD onset and anti-inflammatory drug use at PUD onset in the present study, the specific interaction of NSAIDs with host genetic factors was underexplored. Third, detailed information on the anatomical site of the ulcers or the strains of HP was not available. Fourth, the variants identified by fine-mapping and the overlaps in association signals identified by lookup approaches might result from tagging distinct causal variants, and the meta-analysis fine-mapping using BBJ1-180K as LD reference might be miscalibrated62, which should be interpreted cautiously. Despite the Biobank-scale cohort for HP-stratified analysis, the statistical power is still limited for certain analyses. Even though our subtype analysis revealed the overall similarities and differences in genetic architecture, a large sample size and more detailed classifications are still warranted to elucidate the potential heterogeneity further. In summary, the present study approximately quadrupled the number of risk loci for PUD and its subtypes and improved our understanding of the genetic architecture of PUD. The findings provided insight into the biological pathways involved in PUD pathogenesis and potential links between PUD and GC. We demonstrated that, besides HP-related loci, host genetic factors potentially involved in gastric hormone regulation, cell differentiation and proliferation might play important roles in PUD pathogenesis. Our single-cell analysis further revealed the association of 5-HT-secreting EC cells, somatostatin-secreting stomach D cells and stomach tuft cells with PUD, indicating their key role in PUD etiology. We included four cohorts for east Asian-specific meta-analysis including BBJ1-180K, BBJ1-12K and BBJ2-42K from the BioBank Japan Project10, and TMM-50K from Tohoku University Tohoku Medical Megabank63. Further details on each cohort are described inSupplementary Note. Sample overlap was checked in BBJ1-180K, BBJ1-12K and BBJ2-42K by merging three datasets and estimating the identical-by-descent sharing, and the number of potentially overlapping samples is minimal (<0.06%; Supplementary Fig.32). The clinical characteristics of these cohorts are provided in detail in Supplementary Table1. The research project was approved by the ethics committees at the Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo (application no. 29-74-A0215) and Iwate Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization, Iwate Medical University (application no. HG H25-2). In the present study, we assessed PUD, which is a combination of the two major subtypes, namely DU and GU. Cases with PUD were obtained from the combination of individuals with any of the two major PUD subtypes (DU and GU). Clinical information for cases with GU and DU was obtained via interviews and reviews of medical records using a standardized questionnaire in BBJ1-180K, BBJ1-12K and BBJ2-42K, and by self-administered questionnaires in TMM-50K63. Individuals with comorbidities of GU and DU were additionally categorized into group BU. Individuals without a given diagnosis of peptic ulcers or any HP-related diseases (GU, DU or GC) were used as control samples (Supplementary Table1). The cohorts and phenotypes that were first reported in the present study have been summarized in Supplementary Table41. All samples included in the east Asian-specific analysis are genotyped using commercially available genotyping arrays. QC of autosomal genotypes was performed as described previously. Detailed information on genotyping arrays and QC procedures are provided inSupplementary Note64. Pre-phasing was conducted using Eagle2 (v.2.4.1;https://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/Eagle)65. Imputation was performed with Minimac4 (v.1.0.2;https://github.com/statgen/Minimac4) using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (ref.11) v.5 (1KGp3v5) ALL panel (https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac3#Reference_Panels_for_Download). BBJ1-12K and BBJ2-42K were additionally imputed with the 1KG high-coverage reference panel66(GRCh38). For chromosome X, haplotypes were pre-phased for men and women, and variants were imputed separately in men and women using the same software. Imputed variants withR2< 0.3 were excluded in the association analysis. More than 12 million variants were included in the discovery-stage association analysis. Single-variant association analysis was performed with SAIGE (v.0.44;https://github.com/weizhouUMICH/SAIGE)12, which implements a generalized mixed model with SPA correction controlling for case–control imbalance and cryptic relatedness. The regression included age, sex and the top ten PCs as covariates. For step 1, LD-pruned genotyped variants (PLINK–indep-pairwise 50 5 0.2,https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink)67with MAF > 1% were used to estimate the null models with leave one chromosome out (LOCO). Variants with MAC < 20 were excluded from the association tests (step 2). For sex-stratified analysis, single-variant association analyses were performed with SAIGE, adjusting for the same set of covariates other than sex in men and women. For association tests of the X chromosome, variants were tested separately in men and women using the corresponding null models estimated by autosomes in each sex. Haploid-based dosages of the nonpseudo autosomal region of men were multiplied by 2. The results for each sex were then meta-analyzed using IVW methods implemented in METAL software (v.2011-03-25,http://csg.sph.umich.edu/abecasis/Metal/index.html)68. Genome-wide significant loci were determined by iteratively extending 500-kb flanking regions around the most significant variant until no genome-wide significant variant (P< 5.0 × 10−8) was detected within the extended regions. The most significant variant in each locus was selected as the lead variant. Loci for different traits with lead variants within 500 kb of each other were considered the same, denoted by the most significant lead variant from the locus. Significant variants in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (GRCh37, chromosome 6: 25–34 Mb) were counted as one locus due to the complexity of the region. We performed LDSC (v.1.0.0;https://github.com/bulik/ldsc)14to examine the bias caused by confounding factors, such as population stratification or cryptic relatedness. We employed the LD scores provided by authors for the east Asian population, which were estimated from 1KG EAS individuals. To convert observed-scale heritability to liability-scale heritability, the population prevalence rates in east Asian populations were set to 6.2%, 6.9%, 10.8% and 1.8% for DU, GU, PUD and BU, respectively. The prevalence rates were estimated from the population-based TMM-50K and were similar to those in previous epidemiological studies1. We compared the directions and effect sizes with the replication GWAS sets for the lead variants of significant loci identified in the discovery-stage GWASs. The results of GWASs at the discovery and replication stages were combined using the fixed-effect, inverse-variance method implemented in METAL. Heterogeneity was estimated by Cochran’sQtest. In addition, the random-effects model implemented in GWAMA69was employed to evaluate the heterogeneity (Supplementary Noteand Supplementary Fig.33). We considered the lead variants identified in discovery-stage GWASs as replicated if the variants reached a nominal significance threshold (Prep< 0.05) in the same direction in at least two of the replication GWASs. Summary statistics of PUD and PUD subtypes for European individuals were obtained from FinnGen (release 6 for PUD, DU and GU;https://www.finngen.fi/en/access_results)15, a published GWAS of PUD in UKB (https://cnsgenomics.com/content/data)5and PheWeb UKB-SAIGE12(DU and GU;https://pheweb.org/UKB-SAIGE) (details in Supplementary Table7). Genome coordinates of summary statistics were converted from GRCh38 (hg38) to GRCh37 (hg19) using the University of California Santa Cruz LiftOver tool70if the original summary statistics were based on GRCh38. We performed additional QC, variant normalization71and harmonization for all summary statistics before meta-analyses. Details of QC and harmonization are presented inSupplementary Note. The fixed-effect, inverse-variance method was used to conduct meta-analyses integrating GWAS results in EAS and EUR populations using METAL. We additionally performed fixed-effect meta-analyses to generate EUR-specific summary statistics using the two EUR datasets. Population-specific meta-analyses were used to compare the effect sizes of lead variants identified in cross-ancestry meta-analyses between EAS and EUR populations. To investigate potential associations in GRCh38-specific regions, we further conducted a cross-ancestry meta-analysis combining GRCh38-based datasets (Supplementary Noteand Supplementary Figs.34–35). MR-MEGA (v.0.2:http://www.geenivaramu.ee/en/tools/mr-mega)16was used to perform cross-ancestry meta-regression with four axes of genetic variation derived via multidimensional scaling.Pvalues were recalculated using the χ2statistic due to the lack of support in MR-MEGA forP< 1.0 × 10−14. To assess the genetic correlation between PUD and common binary traits and quantitative traits in east Asian populations, we used cross-trait LDSC28with LD scores estimated from 1KG EAS individuals. East Asian summary statistics were obtained from previous GWASs in BBJ29,30. The MHC region was excluded. To evaluate the cross-ancestry correlations of genetic effect for PUD and subtypes between EAS and EUR, Popcorn (v.1.0:https://github.com/brielin/Popcorn)17was used with pre-computed cross-ancestry LD scores estimated from 1KG EUR and EAS populations. For these analyses, meta-analyzed summary statistics of PUD in EAS and EUR for HapMap3 SNPs (without the MHC region) were used. ABO blood groups for unrelated individuals used in discovery-stage GWASs in BBJ1-180K (KING kingship coefficient72<0.0884,n= 164,613) were inferred from two genotyped variants described previously2. Secretor status was inferred using the best-guess genotype of imputed variants rs1047781 (p.Ile140Phe)73, where AA or AT genotypes are secretors and TT are nonsecretors. Logistic regression was performed to examine (1) the association of blood group or secretor status with PUD and (2) blood group O-secretor status interaction. Details on the logistic regression are described inSupplementary Note. GCTA-COJO (v.1.93.2;https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#COJO)18was employed to perform conditional analysis in each significant locus identified in EAS-specific meta-analysis of PUD and subtypes. We constructed an LD reference panel using the best-guess imputed genotype of 20,000 randomly selected and unrelated individuals of east Asian ancestry from BBJ1-180K. Stepwise model selection was conducted first to select independent association signals (P< 5.0 × 10−8) and a joint analysis of these selected signals was performed next. Variants with MAF > 0.01 were included in the analysis. Fine-mapping was conducted using SuSiE (v.0.11.92;https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR)19with default configurations while allowing ten putative causal variants within each locus. Unrelated individuals (KING kingship coefficient <0.0884,n= 171,085) from BBJ1-180K were used as LD reference, computed by LDstore (v.2.0;http://www.christianbenner.com)74based on the imputed dosages. We defined regions based on the 3-Mb window centered at the lead variants and merged them if the window overlapped. Only variants withR2≥ 0.5 were included in fine-mapping. We reported the missense variants in credible sets, which have a 95% probability of harboring one causal variant. Variants identified in the GWASs were annotated using ANNOVAR (v.2020-06-07; -protocol refGene,avsnp150,clinvar_20200316;https://annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest)75. Chromatin states (core 15-state model) for stomach mucosa and duodenum mucosa were obtained from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project76. Allele frequencies for variants not available in population-specific meta-analysis were obtained from the Genome Aggregation Database77(https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org) or the 1KG. LocusZoom78was used to create the region plot. To investigate the interaction of HP with host genetic factors for the development of peptic ulcers, we performed HP-stratified analyses in HP+and HP−individuals from TMM-50K. HP infection status was determined by anti-HP serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody, measured by the latex agglutination immunoassay. Individuals with anti-HP serum IgG antibody titer ≥10 U ml−1were categorized as HP+. Association tests were performed with the same settings as in the discovery-stage GWASs. Cochran’sQandI² statistics (calculated by R package metafor v.3.4:https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php)79were used to test the effect-size heterogeneity between HP+and HP−GWASs for each subtype. As stratified analysis could reduce power and lead to false-negative results, we estimated the power of GWASs of HP−PUD for the identified HP+-specific variant. (Supplementary Fig.36). Colocalization analysis was conducted using the coloc package (v.5.1.0;https://chr1swallace.github.io/coloc)80for each significant locus identified in EAS meta-analysis under a single causal variant assumption. For loci with multiple independent signals identified in the conditional analysis, coloc was applied to the signals identified by SuSiE81. To estimate the polygenicity (defined as the proportion of SNPs with nonzero effects) and the strength of negative selection (defined as the relationship between MAF and effect sizes, and denoted by S) for PUD, we utilized SBayesS from GCTB software (v.2.0:https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb/#Overview)32. SBayesS employs a Bayesian mixed linear model and reports the posterior means of SNP-based heritability, polygenicity estimates and a metric that indicates negative selection. An LD reference panel for EAS was constructed using the approach described previously32. For a crosstrait comparison of polygenicity estimates in EAS, we included 42 binary traits of BBJ1 in the analysis35. Details of the construction of the LD reference and parameters for SBayesS are provided inSupplementary Note30. PRS models for PUD and PUD subtypes were constructed in east Asians. We used the summary statistics derived from replication GWASs and HP-stratified analysis in the population-based Japanese cohort TMM-50K. PRS-CS (v.2021-Jun-4,https://github.com/getian107/PRScs)35and Python (v.3.8.8) were employed to compute PRS models using HapMap3 SNPs with an EAS-specific LD reference panel from the 1KG. Global shrinkage parameters were obtained from the data by PRS-CS using a fully Bayesian approach (PRS-CS-auto). We applied the models in BBJ1-180K and then tested the associations of PRS with PUD and PUD subtypes using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex and the top five PCs. We evaluated the predictive ability of each PRS model by its improvement of the area under the curve andR2on the liability scale82over a base model that includes age, sex and the top five PCs. MR analysis was performed using TwoSampleMR36to evaluate the causality of PUD or its subtypes on GC. To avoid sample overlap between the exposure and outcome, we conducted an additional meta-analysis combing GWASs for PUD and its subtypes in BBJ1-12K, BBJ2-42K and TMM-50K. A total of 23 available independent variants identified in the EAS-specific meta-analysis were used as instrumental variables. To avoid bias caused by weak instruments, we further estimated per-variantFstatistics for each exposure and removed variants withF< 10 from the instrumental variables for the exposure. MR-PRESSO37was employed to correct for the horizontal pleiotropic variants. The summary statistics for GC were obtained from the previous study conducted in BBJ1-180K30. Statistical power for MR was approximately estimated using methods described previously83. Compared with MR using all available variants, the pleiotropic outlier correction may result in insufficient power (Supplementary Fig.24). Gene-based and pathway analyses were performed using MAGMA (v.1.08:https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma)38implemented in FUMA (v.1.3.8:https://fuma.ctglab.nl)39. An LD reference panel constructed from 1KG EAS population was used. A total of 19,033 protein-coding genes (ENSEMBL84v.92) were tested. The results of the gene-based analysis were then employed to conduct gene-set enrichment analysis with a total of 15,485 curated gene sets and gene ontology terms from MsigDB65v.7.0. We conducted pairwise comparisons of the −log10(P) values generated by MAGMA, using a range of window sizes to evaluate the robustness of the association results in gene-based, tissue-type specificity and cell-type specificity analyses discovered by MAGMA; the effect of window size selection was marginal (Supplementary Figs.37–39). For pairwise effect-size (logarithm of ORs) comparison among PUD, PUD subtypes and GCs in the EAS population, we selected the nonoverlapping (interval between adjacent variants >500 kb) lead variants identified by EAS-specific meta-analysis and the independent signals identified by COJO analysis. For loci associated with two or more phenotypes, we selected the most significant associations (lead variants with the lowestPvalue) for comparison. Effect sizes in EAS-specific meta-analysis were used for PUD and PUD subtypes. Summary statistics for GCs were obtained from a previous study in BBJ1-180K13. For cross-ancestry comparison of variant effect sizes, we included all nonoverlapping lead variants associated with PUD or any subtypes in population-specific meta-analysis or cross-ancestry meta-analysis. Associations, with the lowestPvalues, of loci associated with more than one phenotype were selected for comparison and effect sizes in the population-specific meta-analysis were used. Cochran’sQtest was used to test heterogeneity across the effect sizes. In addition, we compared the WC-corrected effect sizes of the lead variants identified in the EAS meta-analysis in the present study and the variants reported in UKB5using the methods described previously85,86. To investigate whether variants associated with PUD were also associated with other human complex traits in EAS, statistics of the nonoverlapping lead variants and secondary signals for 215 case–control and quantitative traits were obtained from BBJ PheWeb (https://pheweb.jp)7. The LD proxy (LDr2> 0.6) with the highestr2estimated from 1KG EAS was used if a variant was unavailable in the datasets. After multiple-test corrections, the significance threshold was set toP< 8.6 × 10−6. MAGMA38gene-property analysis implemented in the SNP2GENE method of FUMA39was employed for tissue-type specificity analysis with gene expression profile from the GTEx v.8 dataset21. A total of 54 nondiseased tissue types and 30 general tissue types were tested. Tissue types with an FDR < 5% were considered significant. To identify the cell types associated with PUD in the stomach and duodenum, processed scRNA-seq datasets of the human stomach and duodenum were obtained from a previous study48, which filtered for cells with >1,500 transcripts per cell and genes expressed by at least three transcripts in at least one cell. A total of 13,980 genes for 19 cell types in the stomach and 17 cell types in the duodenum were included in the study. The top 10% most specifically expressed genes based on fold-change (defined as the average transcript counts of all cell types except the target cell type divided by the average transcript counts of the target cell type) were extracted for each cell type. SNPs in cell-type-specific genes were used to compute partitioned LD scores in the 1KG Phase 3 EAS or EUR population. The gene coordinates were extended by a window size of 100 kb to capture the effects of regulatory elements. Stratified LDSCs49were performed using the partitioned LD scores of cell-type-specific genes, partitioned LD scores of all available genes in the dataset and the baseline model of 53 annotations for each ancestry on HapMap3 SNPs, excluding the MHC region (downloaded fromhttps://alkesgroup.broadinstitute.org/LDSCORE). We performed gene-set enrichment analysis using MAGMA with the cell-type-specific gene sets described above. We used 1KG Phase 3 EAS and EUR population datasets as reference panels. Variants with MAF < 0.01 or in the MHC region were excluded from the analysis. The gene coordinates were extended by window sizes of 35 kb upstream and 10 kb downstream. IVW meta-analysis was performed using statistics of both ancestries for each method to increase statistical power.Pvalues were calculated using the one-tailed test. Cell types with FDR < 5% within each expression dataset were considered significant. To characterize the effect of variants on gene expression level, we extracted LD proxies (with LDr2> 0.6) in EAS or EUR 1KG Phase 3 with the lead variants and secondary signals in EAS. We extracted only significant SNP–gene pairs with FDR < 5% (pre-computed by the authors) from GTEx v.8 (ref.21). We checked the overlap between the lead variants and secondary signals (including proxies) andcis-eQTL variants in GTEx v.8. The most significantcis-eQTL association for each gene in each tissue was selected for interpretation. To characterize the effect of variants on protein level, we extracted LD proxies (with LDr2> 0.6) in EAS or EUR 1KG Phase 3 with the lead variants and secondary signals in EAS. We extracted genome-wide significant SNP–protein associations from five published, large-scale pQTL studies in recent years22,24,25,26,27, conducted in individuals of mainly European ancestry. We then checked the overlap between the lead variants (including LD proxies) withcis- andtrans-pQTL. The most significant association for each protein was selected for interpretation.

They found 25 new genetic markers linked to ulcers which showed that, though these sores on the walls of the stomach and of the duodenum (the beginning part of the small intestine) share some genetic factors, stomach ulcers have more possible causes. The study also identified a genetic link related to a bacterium calledHelicobacter pylori. The research suggests that the differentiation of stomach cells and the regulation of hormones play a crucial role in the development of ulcers.
Peptic ulcers, caused by the erosion of the lining of the lower esophagus, stomach or upper small intestine, affect around 8 million people each year and have a variety of unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms, some of which can be fatal in extreme circumstances. Naturally, there is a lot of research on this disease; however, up until now, most large-scale studies have focused on European populations, but it’s thought that genetic variation between populations around the world may play a factor in how the disease manifests, as there are different varieties and conditions which vary among regions. For example, in Japan, stomach ulcers are more common than duodenal ones, whereas in Europe, it’s the reverse.
“We performed a large-scale genome study of more than 50,000 peptic ulcer patients and 900,000 controls, or unafflicted people, of East Asian or European ancestries,” said Professor Yoichiro Kamatani from the Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences at the University of Tokyo. “This study combined multiple previous studies, and by doing so, we’ve been able to successfully identify 25 areas on the genome now known to be associated with peptic ulcers. Identifying such sites is a pivotal step in the search for new treatments.”
Kamatani and his team also explored a link betweenHelicobacter pylori(HP) and confirmed the bacteria can infect a host carrying certain genes discovered in this study, with peptic ulcer disease. This particular infection is also more prevalent in East Asian populations than in European populations. However, given the 25 newly identified genetic markers for ulcer susceptibility are common to both European and Asian populations, the team thought the reason for the geographic variation must lie beyond the genes.
“Building upon our previous studies looking at other factors surrounding peptic ulcers, we concluded that the way gastrointestinal cells differentiate from one another during gastric repair and the way gastrointestinal hormones are regulated play a critical role in the formation of peptic ulcers,” said Kamatani. “This knowledge may help provide specific targets for new drugs to reduce symptoms, and the genetic analysis could improve the way medical practitioners rate risks for peptic ulcers, even at the individual level.”
Some of this research proved difficult until recently, partly due to the huge data sets required and the ability to perform analyses on them, but also as it’s only now that the genetic sequencing of single cells from the human stomach and duodenum can occur at scale. The team hopes this kind of large-scale cross-population study can open up more possibilities to explore the way different diseases can affect different populations in different ways.
“Prioritizing ancestry diversity in studies of not only peptic ulcers, but also other complex traits, is critical to understanding the genetic factors at play in a more comprehensive and unbiased manner,” said Kamatani. “This serves as the foundation for translation into clinical interventions that can reduce suffering for millions of people around the world.”

Sign inhere","Carbon capture is essential to reduce the impact of human carbon dioxide emissions on our climate. Researchers at the University of Tokyo and Nagoya University in Japan have developed a method to confirm whether carbon in concrete originates from the raw materials, or from carbon in the air which has been trapped when it reacts with the concrete to form the mineral calcium carbonate. By measuring the ratio of certain carbon isotopes in concrete that had been exposed to the air and concrete that hadn’t, the team could successfully verify that direct air carbon capture had occurred. This method could be useful for the industrial sector and countries looking to offset their carbon emissions.
2023 is on the way to becoming the hottest year on record. Rice crops wilted in Japan and roads melted in the U.S. Despite international agreements and calls to action, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels have continued to increase. If we are to prevent the planet from tipping over the critical threshold of a 2-degree-Celsius temperature rise by 2100 (compared to preindustrial levels), we need to do more. According to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, reducing and preventing further emissions alone is not enough. We must also remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere if we are to hit our target.
Direct air capture (DAC) pulls carbon dioxide from the air using chemicals or physical processes. Increasing the use of DAC technologies is part of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net-zero emissions scenario, a proposed range of methods to enable the global energy sector to remove as much carbon dioxide (CO2) as it emits by 2050. According to the IEA, industry was responsible for a quarter of global energy system CO2emissions in 2022. Cement is the second-most widely used industrial product (after water), and it comes with a high environmental burden.
“As much as 800 kilograms of CO2is emitted per ton of cement during its production, so reducing emissions has become a significant issue in the concrete industry,” explained Professor Ippei Maruyama from the Department of Architecture at the University of Tokyo Graduate School of Engineering. “Concrete has long been known to react with CO2in the air to form calcium carbonate, an undesirable phenomenon because it induces corrosion of the steel bars inside concrete structures. However, the concrete industry is now considering ways to make effective use of this reaction.”
Although problematic for construction, the reaction which causes calcium carbonate to form fixes or traps CO2, removing the gas from the atmosphere. Calcium carbonate is also found naturally in rocks, such as limestone, which are used in concrete manufacturing. “This makes it difficult to distinguish whether or not CO2identified in concrete has been freshly extracted from the air or comes from rocks,” said Maruyama. “So we developed a method to verify this, which could be used to determine whether the concrete produced can be certified as offsetting CO2emissions.”
Researchers carried out the study by making hydrated cement paste samples as a concrete replica. After getting sufficiently hydrated, they ground the paste sample into powder, keeping the nonexposed powder contained and leaving the exposed powder open to the air. After seven and 28 days, they dissolved the powder in acid to collect the gas and using a technique called accelerator mass spectrometry analyzed the ratio of several carbon isotopes (atoms with the same chemical properties but different physical properties), namely carbon-12, carbon-13 and carbon-14. This enabled the team to evaluate where the carbon came from, and whether it was already present in the raw materials, as the carbon ratios reflected the known proportion of carbon isotopes in the air at the time the gas was sealed.
Next the researchers want to apply this lab-based method to real-world locations and test how the varied quantities of raw materials used in local concrete production may affect results. “Fixing carbon dioxide from the air is certified as an act of offsetting CO2emissions, so it is economically valuable in terms of emissions trading. Digging up calcium carbonate for use in concrete is not, so the distinction is very important and this research can help to support a healthy market,” said Maruyama. “We believe that the carbon neutrality and a circular economy in the construction industry are essential to our future, particularly in Japan where this industry has a role in supporting business continuity and recovery from natural disasters.”

However, at present the chemistry of LIBs requires, among other elements, cobalt (Co), which will probably become scarce over time in addition to posing supply chain risks related to its single source, human rights and mining practices. To address this problem, we construct a LIB pairing a Co-free cathode with a silicon suboxide (SiOx) anode that possesses a high cut-off voltage of 4.9 V and sustains unprecedented 1,000 cycles. Underlying this favourable electrode combination is a rational electrolyte design based on 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC featuring a shifted potential, which serves to aid formation of robust passivation layers on the anode and promote electrolyte stability against both reductive and oxidative degradations. Our electrolyte formulation offers a pathway towards both sustainable and high-performing LIBs, while the concept could be applied to other electrochemical energy technologies. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) play an essential role in enabling the transition to a sustainable society with reduced carbon emissions by supporting clean energy generation, green transportation and more efficient energy use. It is widely expected that achieving a lower carbon and greener future will rely on the development of LIBs with high energy density (high capacity and high voltage), high environmental friendliness and low cost (Earth abundance). The chemistry of LIBs, with carbon-based negative electrodes (anodes) and metal oxide-based positive electrodes (cathodes), has remained largely unchanged since their commercialization in 1991 by Sony and Asahi Kasei. In particular, Co has been widely employed in cathode materials because it provides a reasonable reaction potential (Co4+/Co3+; ≥3.8 V versus Li/Li+) and improves the electronic/ionic conductivity and structural integrity of cathodes1,2. For example, layered oxides LiCoO2, LiNixCoyMnzO2and LiNixCoyAlzO2provide high practical capacities (~220 mAh g−1), high rate capabilities and extended cycle life, and, thus, are utilized in diverse batteries for use in mobile phones, electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage systems. However, Co is mined as a by-product of Ni and Cu ores in specific areas (Democratic Republic of Congo), thus raising concerns of an economically and geopolitically constrained supply chain3,4,5. The problem of child labour in the mining of this toxic mineral is also a severe ethical and health concern3. In this regard, considerable efforts have been focused on eliminating Co from cathodes. Among the various Co-free materials developed over the past decades, spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4is one of the favourite candidates due to its high operating potential (average 4.7 V versus Li/Li+)5. However, its theoretical capacity (CT, 147 mAh g−1) is lower than that of Co-based layered oxides currently in use5. To meet the growing demand for high-energy-density batteries, the replacement of a carbon anode (graphite;CT= 372 mAh g−1at ≤0.1 V versus Li/Li+) with a high-capacity and Earth-abundant silicon suboxide (SiOx) anode (CT= 1,965–4,200 mAh g−1with 2 ≥x≥ 0 at ≤0.4 V versus Li/Li+) should also be considered concurrently. This ideal SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4battery system offers low cost, high sustainability and high theoretical energy density (~610 Wh kg−1, based on a negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 1), compared with those of commercial LIBs (~475 Wh kg−1) with graphite anodes and LiCoO2cathodes (theoretically 274 mAh g−1, but practically ~190 mAh g−1with an average operating potential of ~3.9 V versus Li/Li+due to inevitable structural collapse)6,7,8,9. Also, it does not require change of the battery fabrication processes currently used. However, the realization of this promising battery system has been limited by severe electrolyte decomposition at the anode and cathode surfaces because the reaction (lithiation/delithiation) potentials of SiOx(≤0.4 V versus Li/Li+) and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4(≥4.7 V versus Li/Li+) are outside the operating potential windows of existing electrolytes10,11. To address this problem, functional electrolytes and electrolyte additives have been developed over the past decades. These materials provide wide potential windows and form passivation films (solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs)) on the anode surfaces, kinetically retarding electrolyte degradation by blocking direct contact between the electrode and electrolyte. For instance, ether-based (such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) and tetrahydrofuran)12,13and fluorinated solvent-based electrolytes (such as fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC))14,15were applied to improve the reversibilities of SiOxand LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, respectively. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, a stable SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4battery has not been realized due to the absence of electrolytes that provide high redox stabilities. To establish a design strategy, the thermodynamic shift of lithiation/delithiation potential of SiOx, which is dominated by the chemical potential of Li+in the electrolyte, should be highlighted as a critical factor in the reduction stability of the electrolyte16,17,18,19. The reductive decomposition of the electrolyte at the SiOxanode, in particular, can be largely suppressed by upshifting its inherent lithiation/delithiation potential, reducing the thermodynamic driving force of electrolyte reduction and thus unburdening the kinetic support of the SEI20,21. However, this strategy is yet to be applied to high-voltage batteries because the mechanisms behind the potential shift remain unclear, although the redox potential of an electrode depends on the electrolyte16,17,18,19. Recently, our group reported that the chemical potential of Li+increases in an ion-dense (Li+–Li+and Li+–anion) environment22,23. The progressive formation of ion-pair aggregates contributes to an upward shift in the redox potential of an electrode, thus thermodynamically mitigating the electrolyte decomposition at the electrode surface. Critically, the potentials of Li+-related reactions (such as alloying and intercalation) shift by magnitudes that are identical to that of the redox potential of Li/Li+. The substantial parallel shift (~0.6 V) cannot be observed in a typical (two-electrode) battery system and has thus been overlooked in the development and design of electrolytes and batteries22,23. Another critical factor is the protection of the SiOxsurface with a highly Li+-conductive and mechanically/chemically stable SEI24,25. The lithiation/delithiation of SiOxaccompanies a considerable change in volume of up to 200% (ref.7), causing severe damage not only to the SiOxparticles, but also to the surface SEI layer. This accelerates electrolyte degradation by continuously exposing the electrode surface to the electrolyte24,25,26. Therefore, completely covering the SiOxsurface with a robust SEI is essential in ensuring stable cycling with minimal electrolyte decomposition. Considering these two crucial factors (Li/Li+potential upshift and advanced SEI formation), we report on the stable operation of a SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4battery over 1,000 cycles with an upper cut-off voltage of 4.9 V realized by optimizing its overall potential diagram in a strategically designed 3.4 mol L−1(M) LiN(SO2F)2(LiFSI)/methyl (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) carbonate (FEMC) electrolyte. This electrolyte exhibits unique thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics. It features upshifting of the reaction potential of the SiOxanode, which is essential to reduce the thermodynamic driving force of electrolyte reduction. The electrolyte enables formation of a robust anion-derived passivation film on the SiOxanode surface with tuned electronic states of anions. Additionally, high electrochemical stability can be realized for a high-potential LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode, and degradation at high potentials, such as aluminium (Al) corrosion and transition metal dissolution from the cathode, can be suppressed. Figure1represents the optimized potential diagram of a highly sustainable high-energy-density battery system, combined with a high-capacity, Earth-abundant SiOxanode and a high-potential, Co-free spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte. The stabilization mechanisms of the SiOxanode in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC include thermodynamic (upshifted potential) and kinetic (formation of SEI) factors. The upshifted electrode potential of SiOxaids in unburdening the kinetic support of the SEI, and, furthermore, the anion-derived SEI suppresses electrolyte decomposition more effectively. Notably, the upshifts in the electrode potentials of the SiOxanode and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode are identical, thus maintaining the overall battery voltage (Supplementary Note1) while sustaining the electrode potential of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode within the potential window of 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC. For a comparison, the scenario of a SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4battery with a traditional carbonate-based electrolyte is included. To optimize the overall potential diagram of the SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4battery, the electrolyte, 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC, was designed as follows. The LiFSI salt was used due to its high solubility and capacity to form a robust anion-derived SEI27,28. FEMC was used as the solvent because the fluoro moiety increased the potential of solvent oxidation14,29. In addition, it reduced the negative partial charges on the oxygen atoms in the carbonate30,31, weakening Li+(solvent)nsolvation and promoting the formation of more Li+–anion ion pairs32,33. Finally, the salt concentration was increased to realize a peculiar solution structure, wherein Li+and FSI−ions were strongly coordinated and formed a congested ion-pair network, yielding several advantageous features. First, extensive formation of the ion-pair network destabilizes Li+in the electrolyte (increases the chemical potential of Li+) and upshifts the reaction potential of SiOx, reducing the thermodynamic driving force of electrolyte reduction and thus unburdening the kinetic support of the SEI (Fig.1)22,23. Second, the ion-pair-dominated solution structure provides a large amount of anions with modified electronic states34, enabling the formation of a highly Li+-conductive, mechanically/chemically stable anion-derived SEI on the negatively charged SiOxsurface35,36,37. This advanced SEI effectively suppresses further electrolyte degradation at the SiOxsurface (Fig.1). Finally, several technical issues encountered at the positive LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4electrode under a high potential, such as electrolyte oxidation, Al corrosion and transition metal dissolution, are highly suppressed in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC by the increased potential of solvent oxidation and weak solvation capacity of the electrolyte14,29,30,38,39. Overall, high-level redox stabilities should be observed. The design strategy of the electrolyte structure was verified via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The calculated solution structures of 1.0 M LiFSI/ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC and 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC are shown in Fig.2a. The solution structure of the electrolyte changes drastically with the salt concentration and introduction of FEMC. For instance, Li+is surrounded by three or four EMC solvent molecules and one FSI−anion in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC. In contrast, multiple Li+and FSI−ions are coordinated together while forming a closely packed ion-pair network in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC. The position of the primary peak in the radial distribution functiong(r)of Li+–Li+shifts to a lower distance and the intensities ofg(r)for Li+–Li+and Li+–OFSI−are largely increased in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC (Supplementary Fig.1). The solution structures of the electrolytes were also evaluated via Raman spectroscopy (Fig.2band Supplementary Fig.2). The S–N–S stretching vibrational mode of FSI−is considerably upshifted from 728 to 740 cm−1via the replacement of EMC with FEMC, indicating that the coordination states of FSI−change from solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIP, bare FSI−and/or FSI−solvated with solvent molecules) and contact ion pairs (CIP, FSI−coordinated to one Li+) to ion-pair aggregates (AGG-I and AGG-II, where more than two FSI–and Li+ions coordinate while forming an ion-pair network)40. The peak position is further upshifted to 752 cm−1with increasing salt concentration. Thus, the computational and experimental studies suggest that the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte displays an ion-pair aggregate-dominated solution structure. a, Representative solution structures of 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC, 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC and 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC, as calculated via MD simulations.b, Raman spectra of the prepared electrolytes. The peak between 700 and 780 cm−1corresponds to the coordination environment of the FSI−anion. Figure3ashows the charge–discharge curves and cycling stabilities of Li|SiOxhalf-cells in three electrolytes, that is, 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC, 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC and 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC. The studies were conducted using a slow current of 150 mA g−1, requiring >3 months for 80 cycles, to carefully evaluate the reduction stabilities of the electrolytes on the SiOxsurface. A stable cycling of Li|SiOxunder such slow and long duration has been rarely reported because slow cycling exacerbates the electrolyte decomposition on the SiOxsurface7,9. Even under such severe conditions, 93% of the capacity is retained after 80 cycles in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC, which is much higher than the capacity retentions in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC (19% after 80 cycles) and 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC (85% after 80 cycles). A similar trend is observed in the galvanostatic Li plating/stripping test, wherein the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte exhibits a substantially higher Coulombic efficiency (~97%) than that of 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC (≤60%; Supplementary Fig.4). The optimal performance is observed using the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte designed in this study. a, Charge and discharge curves of a Li|SiOxhalf-cell in the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte. The inset shows the capacity retention of cells with various electrolytes as a function of the cycle number. The first charge and discharge curves and Coulombic efficiencies of the Li|SiOxhalf-cells in the prepared electrolytes are shown in Supplementary Fig.3.b, Cyclic voltammograms of the SiOxanode in the prepared electrolytes. The reaction potentials of SiOxwere calibrated based on ferrocene, which is an IUPAC-recommended electrolyte-independent redox complex (Supplementary Fig.5)41,42. The increase in capacity during the initial cycles of the Li|SiOxcells may be ascribed to the stabilization (activation) of the SiOxanodes, involving their bulk and surface reconstruction via complex interactions between the binder, active material and electrolyte50,51. As a crucial factor influencing the reversibility, we focused on the redox potential of Li/Li+(the lowest possible reaction potential of SiOx), which should correlate closely with the degree of reductive electrolyte decomposition22. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed with an International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)-recommended electrolyte-independent redox system (ferrocene, Fc/Fc+) as a reference electrode to estimate the redox potentials of Li/Li+(and thus the reaction potentials of SiOx) in various electrolytes41,42. As shown in Supplementary Fig.5, the respective redox potentials of ferrocene are 3.25, 3.07 and 2.91 V versus Li/Li+in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC, 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC and 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC. Correspondingly, the redox potential of Li/Li+(V versus Fc/Fc+) is considerably upshifted by 0.34 V in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC relative to that in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC (Fig.3band Supplementary Fig.5). This remarkable thermodynamic variation in the redox potential is due to the chemical potential (stability) of Li+in the electrolyte22,23. As shown in Fig.2and Supplementary Fig.1, the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte exhibits a unique solution structure, wherein most Li+and FSI−ions are extensively coordinated to form a dense ion-pair network. This configuration drastically destabilizes Li+in the electrolyte (Supplementary Fig.6), resulting in simultaneous upshifts of identical magnitudes of the redox potentials of the anode and cathode22,23. Notably, the burden of the SEI can be largely mitigated by reducing the thermodynamic driving force of electrolyte reduction with the upshifted reaction potential20,21. Indeed, the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte, which exhibits a redox potential of Li/Li+that is 0.6 V higher (−2.91 V versus Fc/Fc+) than that of 1.0 M LiFSI/diglyme (−3.48 V versus Fc/Fc+), provides a considerably enhanced stability (Supplementary Figs.5and7). Consequently, the considerably upshifted redox potential of Li/Li+(and thus, simultaneously upshifted reaction potential of SiOx) in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC unburdens the kinetic support of the SEI, contributing to the decrease in the reductive decomposition of the electrolyte at the SiOxsurface. In addition to the thermodynamic upshift of the electrode potential, kinetic hindrance of electrolyte decomposition by the SEI should be considered35,43. This is because the reaction potential of the SiOxanode remains outside the thermodynamic potential window of the electrolyte, although the burden of the SEI kinetic support is decreased via the upshifting of the electrode potential in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC. In this respect, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the cycled SiOxelectrodes was performed. Large amounts of various functionalities (Li–F, S–O–F, S=O and S–S) are detected on the SiOxsurface in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC (Fig.4a), indicating that the FSI−anions are progressively decomposed34. This aids in forming an inorganic-rich SEI, which provides a high ionic conductivity and mechanical/chemical stability35,36,37. According to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a low interfacial resistance is maintained upon cycling and the signals representing the damage of SEI on the SiOxsurface are undetected in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC even after 50 cycles (Fig.4b,cand Supplementary Fig.8). Such a substantial stabilization is not observed using 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC. a,b, Li 1s, F 1s, S 2p(a) and Si 2p(b) XPS spectra of the SiOxelectrodes cycled in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC and 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC.c, Schematic diagram of the SEI stability on cycling in electrolytes with different compositions. Overall, stable cycling of the SiOxanode is thermodynamically (upshifted electrode potential) and kinetically (anion-derived SEI) realized using 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC, which is due to its distinct solution structure. After confirming that the unique coordination environments of Li+and FSI−in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC result in the high reversibility of the SiOxanode, we evaluated the oxidative stability of the electrolyte. Most electrolytes developed for use with Si-based anodes are not used with high-potential cathodes because of the poor oxidative stabilities of the electrolytes7,10. However, the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte enables the stable operation of a Li|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4half-cell (≥90% capacity retention after 100 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of ~99%) with an upper cut-off potential of 4.9 V at a low constant C rate of 0.2C, which is impossible in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC (continuous oxidative decomposition at 4.5 V versus Li/Li+) and 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC (78% capacity retention after 100 cycles with a poor Coulombic efficiency of <90%; Fig.5aand Supplementary Fig.9). This indicates that the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte can deliver a wide operating potential window covering those of the Co-free, high-potential LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode and high-capacity, low-potential SiOxanode on the basis of a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic effects. a, Charge and discharge curves of the Li|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4half-cell with 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC. The inset shows the Coulombic efficiencies of the cells with the prepared electrolytes as a function of the cycle number. The first charge and discharge curves are shown in Supplementary Fig.9.b,c, Oxidative stabilities of the electrolytes on Pt (b) and corrosion stabilities of the Al current collector (c) in the three electrolytes. The origin of low initial Coulombic efficiency can be a passivation film (SEI and CEI) formation (Fig.4and Supplementary Fig.10). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed to investigate the anodic limits of the electrolytes and their tolerance against Al corrosion, using Pt or Al as the working electrode. The anodic current flow on Pt was initiated at >5.3 V (versus Li/Li+) in 1.0 and 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolytes, which was higher than that in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC (4.7 V versus Li/Li+), thus including the upper cut-off potential of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode (4.9 V versus Li/Li+; Fig.5a,b). This trend is consistent with an increase in the oxidative stability of the electrolyte upon introducing the electron-withdrawing F groups14,29. Noticeably, Al corrosion is not observed at ≤5.8 V (versus Li/Li+) in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC, whereas it commences at <4.5 V (versus Li/Li+) in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC and 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC (Fig.5c). Al corrosion occurs with the formation of Al3+(solvent)nsolvates and/or Al(anion)ncomplexes, followed by their diffusion into the bulk electrolyte38. However, such solvates are hardly formed in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC owing to the weak solvating power of FEMC30. Moreover, the diffusion of Al3+complexes into the bulk electrolyte is kinetically retarded because of the poor dissolution capacity of the ion-pair-congested electrolyte39. Floating tests with carbon electrodes, which provide the largest surface areas of the cathode composites as conductive additives, also indicate the high oxidative stability of 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC at >5.0 V versus Li/Li+(Supplementary Fig.11). The solvent fluorination, weak solvating power and unique solution structure improve the oxidative stability of the electrolyte and prevent Al corrosion in a thermodynamic (increased potential of solvent oxidation) and kinetic (impeded generation and diffusion of Al3+solvates and complexes) manner. Before assembling full SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4coin-type cells with 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolytes, the SiOxelectrodes were pre-activated to compensate their inherently large irreversible capacities in the initial cycles (Supplementary Fig.12)7. Notably, pre-activation does not mean full lithiation, which provides a large amount of additional Li source to the cell. The cycling stabilities of the pre-activated full SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cells with average operating voltages of 4.3 V under upper cut-off voltages of 4.9 V at low constant C rates of 0.2C in various electrolytes are shown in Supplementary Fig.13. Notably, 85% of the maximum capacity is maintained after 300 cycles in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC, whereas the cell performance declines drastically in 1.0 M LiFSI/EMC (continuous oxidative decomposition upon charging), 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC (56% after 100 cycles) and commercial 1.0 M LiPF6/ethylene carbonate:dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC, 1:1, v/v, 56% after 300 cycles). A negligible capacity decay is observed in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC at a constant C rate of 0.5C over 500 cycles, with a Coulombic efficiency of ~100% (Fig.6). Moreover, the cycling study conducted under harsh conditions of 55 °C reveals a considerably improved cycling stability (72% capacity retention after 300 cycles) in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC compared to that in 1.0 M LiPF6/EC:DMC (1:1, v/v, 52% after 100 cycles; Supplementary Fig.14). The result of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveals negligible amounts of Mn and Ni on the SiOxanode cycled in the full-cell with 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC, indicating that transition metal dissolution from the cathode is highly suppressed due to the unique solution structure and weak solvating power of the electrolyte (Supplementary Fig.15)14,29,30,38,39. This is in contrast to that obtained using 1.0 M LiPF6/EC:DMC (1:1, v/v), which exhibits severe transition metal dissolution. In addition, highly reproducible long-term cycling of full-cells over 1,000 cycles under practical battery conditions (high-loading-level cathodes, limited amounts of electrolytes with standard electrolyte additives) supports the high redox stabilities of 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC (Supplementary Figs.16and17). a, Discharge capacity retention of the pre-activated full SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cell with an upper cut-off voltage of 4.9 V at a low constant C rate of 0.5C in 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC as a function of the cycle number. Every fifth point is plotted, and the inset shows the charge and discharge curves of the full-cell. The capacity was calculated on the basis of the weight of the cathode active materials.b, Comparison of the performance with those of previously reported full-cells with SiOxanodes. The plot shows four parameters: the capacity of the SiOxanodes (xaxis), upper cut-off voltages of the full-cells (yaxis), cycle numbers of the full-cells (colour depth) and capacity retention of the full-cells per cycle (diameter, with capacity retention improving with increasing diameter). The details of the literature data and normalization are described in Supplementary Tables3and4(refs.52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71). Note that most previous reports are based on coin-cell studies, and our experimental conditions are most severe for achieving better cycling performance (high electrode loading, limited electrolyte volume, slow C rates and high cut-off voltages), as detailed in Supplementary Table3. The full-cell and rate performances with high-loading-level cathodes and electrolyte additives are also shown in Supplementary Figs.16–18. In conclusion, 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC provides unusual stabilities at the SiOxanode and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cathode, which are incomparable to those of other electrolytes proposed so far (Fig.6b). Stable long-term cycling of high-energy-density yet sustainable SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4batteries over 1,000 cycles was realized with 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolytes by optimizing the overall potential diagram of the full-cell. The solution structure of 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC was distinct, with most Li+and FSI−ions extensively coordinated to form a dense ion-pair network. This destabilized Li+in the electrolyte and enabled a large amount of the anion with a modified electronic state to approach the negatively charged SiOxanode. This contributed to the stable cycling of the SiOxanode by upshifting the thermodynamic reaction potential of SiOxand forming a highly functional anion-derived SEI. Moreover, several problems induced by the high-potential cathode could be resolved because of the thermodynamically enhanced oxidative stability and the kinetically prevented Al corrosion and transition metal dissolution from the cathode composites. These advanced functionalities were due to the increased potential of solvent oxidation and weakened solvating power with solvent fluorination and poor dissolution capacity of the electrolyte. It is important to note that while the proposed electrolyte strategy in this paper is expected to promote the utilization of economic and green electrode materials, challenges still remain for the commercialization of next-generation battery systems. Further optimization and development of electrode composition and cell design, including thin separators with high oxidation and reduction stabilities, high oxidation-tolerant carbon additives with high electrical conductivity and advanced binders and functional electrolyte additives passivating electrodes, along with devising battery pack designs to improve overall battery safety, will help to enhance battery performance under various operating conditions (low and high temperatures, fast charge, deep discharge and so on), thus facilitating the realization of highly sustainable high-energy-density batteries. The electrolytes were prepared using a LiFSI salt (Nippon Shokubai) and solvents (EMC, Kishida Chemical; FEMC, Halocarbon) and diglyme (Kishida Chemical) in an Ar-filled glovebox. The commercial 1.0 M LiPF6/EC:DMC (1:1, v/v) electrolyte was purchased from Kishida Chemical and used as received. SiOx(BTR New Energy Material), acetylene black (AB, Denka Black Li-400, Denka) and polyamide-imide binder (PAI, Torlon-4000T, Solvay) were dissolved inN-methylpyrrolidone (NMP, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) in a mass ratio of 70:15:15. The prepared slurry was coated onto a Cu foil (Fchikawa Rare Metal) and dried at 80 °C in an oven. The resulting electrode was further heated at 400 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere to strengthen the mechanical stability of the PAI binder44. LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4(Samsung SDI), AB or blended carbons (AB and graphitized Ketjen black (FD7010, Lion Specialty Chemicals)) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or lithiated polyacrylic acid (LiPAA) binder were mixed in NMP or water in a mass ratio of 80:10:10 or 85:10:5 or 80:15:5. The obtained viscous slurry was cast onto an Al (Fchikawa Rare Metal) or carbon-coated Al foil (SDX-PM, Showa Denko) and then dried at 80 °C in an oven. LiPAA was prepared by titrating an aqueous solution of PAA (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) with LiOH (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) until the pH of the solution was 7 (ref.45). The 2032 coin-type cell components were purchased from Hohsen, and all cell components and SiOxand LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4electrodes were dried at 200 or 120 °C under vacuum before use46. The coin-type half- and full-cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox under the supplied conditions. Cellulose (Nippon Kodoshi) and polypropylene membranes (Celgard) and glass fibre filters (Advantec) were used as separators. The galvanostatic charge and discharge studies were performed at various temperatures using a charge–discharge instrument (TOSCAT-3100, Toyo System). The SiOxelectrodes of the full-cells were pre-activated to compensate for Li consumption upon their initial activation7. Initially, a Li|SiOxhalf-cell was fabricated and cycled (lithiated and delithiated) once in the potential range 0.01–1.5 V. Subsequently, it was relithiated for 30–40 min at a constant current of 150 mA g−1in the prepared electrolyte (1.0 M LiFSI/EMC, 1.0 M LiFSI/FEMC, 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC or 1.0 M LiPF6/EC:DMC (1:1, v/v)) to prevent corrosion of the Cu current collector. The capacity ratio of the lithiated pre-activated SiOxelectrode was approximately 5%. Finally, the pre-activated SiOxelectrode was carefully collected from the cell and reassembled with fresh electrolyte. The pre-activated full SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cell, as shown in Fig.6, was fabricated using a LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4electrode (loading level of 5 mg cm−2), pre-activated SiOxand the 3.4 M LiFSI/FEMC electrolyte. A glass fibre filter was used as the separator, and the N/P ratio was controlled at 1.4. The N/P ratio and C rate were calculated using the capacities of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4(147 mAh g−1) and SiOx(1,500 mAh g−1). The cell was cycled ten times at a C rate of 0.2C to stabilize the SEI before applying a C rate of 0.5C. In every half- and full-cell study, 80 μl of electrolyte was used, except those shown in Supplementary Figs.16and17, wherein 40 μl was used to simulate the practical battery condition. The electrode and cell data of other half- and full-cells are provided in the figure captions. Coulombic efficiency is defined as the percentage of the discharge capacity at thenth cycle divided by the charge capacity at thenth cycle (that is, the ratio between the number of electrons transferred from the cathode to the anode during charging and the number transferred back during discharging). Capacity retention is defined as the percentage of the discharge capacity at thenth cycle divided by the maximum discharge capacity over all cycles. Unidentifiably slight side reactions hindered by an electrolyte-rich condition in the coin cell might have led to an observation of better capacity retention than the expected value based on the Coulombic efficiency (Supplementary Figs.16and17)47. Despite this unavoidable minor error, the present results still establish an important benchmark for stable operation of the SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4system, as evidenced by its distinctiveness in the relative comparison provided in Fig.6. The redox potential of Li/Li+was estimated via CV using a three-electrode cell (Pt|Li|Li) in the given electrolytes with ~1 mM of the IUPAC-recommended electrolyte-independent redox system (Fc/Fc+). CV was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. Cyclic voltammograms illustrated in the figure in Supplementary Note1were obtained using a three-electrode cell consisting of a working electrode (SiOxor Li4Ti5O12or LiFePO4or LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4electrode) and Li metal as the counter and reference electrodes with given electrolytes at a scan rate of 0.05 or 0.1 mV s−1. The galvanostatic Li plating/stripping study was conducted with half-cells (Li|Cu) in various electrolytes at a constant current density of 0.5 mA cm−2and an areal capacity of 0.5 mAh cm−2with a cut-off voltage of 0.5 V. The deposited diameter of Li on the Cu foil was 1.2 cm. The interfacial resistance between the electrode and electrolyte in a cycled half-cell (Li|SiOx) in its fully discharged state was analysed using EIS (VMP3 potentiostat, BioLogic), with an amplitude of 10 mV over the frequency range 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The oxidative stabilities of the electrolytes and the Al corrosion in various electrolytes were investigated via LSV in a three-electrode cell with a Pt plate or an Al foil as the working electrode and Li metal as the counter and reference electrodes. LSV was performed using the VMP3 potentiostat from the open-circuit potential to 6 V (versus Li/Li+) at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s−1. The floating test was conducted using conductive carbon additive/PVDF binder (1:1, w/w) electrodes coated on Al current collectors as the working electrodes and Li metal as the counter and reference electrodes from 4.0 to 5.6 V versus Li/Li+. The basic physicochemical properties of the prepared electrolytes are shown in Supplementary Table1. The densities and viscosities of the electrolytes were measured using an oscillator-type densitometer (DMA 35, Anton Paar) and a viscometer (Lovis 2000 M, Anton Paar), respectively. The ionic conductivities of the electrolytes were evaluated in a two-electrode glass cell (Pt|electrolyte|Pt) via alternating-current impedance spectroscopy (Solartron 147055BEC, Solartron Analytical). The solution structures of the electrolytes were analysed via Raman spectroscopy (NRS-5100, JASCO) at a laser excitation wavelength of 532 nm. The electrolyte was placed in a quartz cell, which was sealed with Parafilm in an Ar-filled glovebox to avoid air contamination. The surface chemistry of the cycled SiOxand LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4electrodes was studied via XPS (PHI 5000 Versaprobe-II, ULVAC-PHI) with a monochromatic AlKα X-ray source. The samples were prepared by disassembling the cycled cells and then rinsing them several times with DME in an Ar-filled glovebox. The samples were then transferred into the XPS chamber without exposure to the air using a specially designed transfer vessel. EDX of the SiOxelectrodes was performed to estimate the amounts of dissolved transition metals originating from the cathode materials. The SiOxelectrodes were carefully collected from the cycled full SiOx|LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4cells under the provided conditions and then washed several times with DME before measurement. The MD simulations were conducted to estimate the electrolyte structures and stabilities of Li+(electrostatic potentials at the Li+sites) in the prepared electrolytes using the AMBER16 package. The details of the calculation model are shown in Supplementary Table2, with the numbers of solvent molecules/ions based on the experimental compositions. The generalized AMBER force field48was used for all solvent molecules/ions in the simulations. The atomic point charges were obtained via gas-phase density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/cc-pvdz level using the Gaussian 16 package. The time step was set to 1 fs using the SHAKE method49, constraining the H–heavy atom bond distances. The simulation cells were adjusted using NPT-MD simulations at 1 bar and 298 K, followed by NVT-MD simulations (298 K) to equilibrate the system for 1 ns and subsequent sampling for 10 ns. The calculated solution structures were consistent with the data obtained via Raman spectroscopy (Fig.2). The electrostatic potential was evaluated by summing all electrostatic interactions from the electrolyte solvent molecules/ions to each Li+ion using the particle mesh Ewald method under periodic boundary conditions and then averaging the obtained values.

They play a key role in the shift to a greener world. A wide variety of elements are used in their production, including cobalt, the production of which contributes to some environmental, economic, and social issues. For the first time, a team including researchers from the University of Tokyo presents a viable alternative to cobalt which in some ways can outperform state-of-the-art battery chemistry. It also survives a large number of recharge cycles, and the underlying theory can be applied to other problems.
The chances are, you are reading this article on a laptop or smartphone, and if not, you probably own at least one of those. Inside either device, and many others, you will find a lithium-ion battery (LIB). For decades now, LIBs have been the standard way of powering portable or mobile electronic devices and machines. As the world transitions from fossil fuels, they are seen as an important step for use in electric cars and home batteries for those with solar panels. But just as batteries have a positive end and a negative end, LIBs have negative points set against their positive ones.
For one thing, although they are some of the most power-dense portable power sources available, many people wish that LIBs could yield a larger energy density to make them either last longer or power even more demanding machines. Also, they can survive a large number of recharge cycles, but they also degrade with time; it would be better for everyone if batteries could survive more recharge cycles and maintain their capacities for longer. But perhaps the most alarming problem with current LIBs lies in one of the elements used for their construction.
Cobalt is widely used for a key part of LIBs, the electrodes. All batteries work in a similar way: Two electrodes, one positive and one negative, promote the flow of lithium ions between them in what’s called the electrolyte when connected to an external circuit. Cobalt, however, is a rare element; so rare in fact that there is only one main source of it at present: a series of mines located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Many issues have been reported over the years about the environmental consequences of these mines, as well as the labor conditions there, including the use of child labor. From a supply perspective also, the source of cobalt is an issue due to political and economic instability in the region.
“There are many reasons we want to transition away from using cobalt in order to improve lithium-ion batteries,” said Professor Atsuo Yamada from the Department of Chemical System Engineering. “For us the challenge is a technical one, but its impact could be environmental, economic, social and technological. We are pleased to report a new alternative to cobalt by using a novel combination of elements in the electrodes, including lithium, nickel, manganese, silicon and oxygen — all far more common and less problematic elements to produce and work with.”
The new electrodes and electrolyte Yamada and his team created are not only devoid of cobalt, but they actually improve upon current battery chemistry in some ways. The new LIBs’ energy density is about 60% higher, which could equate to longer life, and it can deliver 4.4 volts, as opposed to about 3.2-3.7 volts of typical LIBs. But one of the most surprising technological achievements was to improve upon the recharge characteristics. Test batteries with the new chemistry were able to fully charge and discharge over 1,000 cycles (simulating three years of full use and charging), whilst only losing about 20% of their storage capacity.
“We are delighted with the results so far, but getting here was not without its challenges. It was a struggle trying to suppress various undesirable reactions that were taking place in early versions of our new battery chemistries which could have drastically reduced the longevity of the batteries,” said Yamada. “And we still have some way to go, as there are lingering minor reactions to mitigate in order to improve the safety and longevity even further. At present, we are confident that this research will lead to improved batteries for many applications, but some, where extreme durability and lifespan are required, might not be satisfied just yet.”
Although Yamada and his team were exploring applications in LIBs, the concepts that underlie their recent development can be applied to other electrochemical processes and devices, including other kinds of batteries, water splitting (to produce hydrogen and oxygen), ore smelting, electro-coating and more.

However, predicting detailed mechanisms of how proteins fold into specific native structures remains challenging, especially for multidomain proteins constituting most of the proteomes. Here, we develop a simple structure-based statistical mechanical model that introduces nonlocal interactions driving the folding of multidomain proteins. Our model successfully predicts protein folding processes consistent with experiments, without the limitations of protein size and shape. Furthermore, slight modifications of the model allow prediction of disulfide-oxidative and disulfide-intact protein folding. These predictions depict details of the folding processes beyond reproducing experimental results and provide a rationale for the folding mechanisms. Thus, our physics-based models enable accurate prediction of protein folding mechanisms with low computational complexity, paving the way for solving the folding process component of the ‘protein folding problem’. Recently, we have witnessed a remarkable leap in the prediction of three-dimensional protein structure from amino acid sequences by deep neural networks1,2, and these breakthroughs have made significant progress toward solving the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’3. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods do not provide an understanding of how proteins fold into specific structures, i.e., the folding process component of the ‘protein folding problem’3,4. Therefore, computational prediction of protein folding mechanisms based on protein structures readily available from experiments or machine learning remains a challenge. Many experimental studies have characterized the folding mechanisms of both single-domain proteins, which typically show simple two-state folding behavior5, and multidomain proteins, which have many nonlocal interactions and exhibit more complicated folding behavior6,7,8,9. The experimentally observed folding pathways of small single-domain proteins have been successfully predicted using an Ising-like simple statistical mechanical model, called the Wako–Saitô–Muñoz–Eaton (WSME) model, which is a coarse-grained structure-based model for proteins10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. This model assumes that folding is initiated by local interactions between adjacent residues and propagates to distal regions via the growth and docking of native segments. Remarkably, the WSME model can be used to calculate the free energy landscapes of proteins, providing a comprehensive understanding of folding mechanisms, including folding pathways, kinetics, and the structures of intermediates and transition states. However, this model cannot be used for the prediction of the folding mechanisms of multidomain proteins. Furthermore, although long-time molecular dynamics calculations allow simulating the folding reactions of small single-domain proteins in up to 1 ms25, they cannot simulate multidomain protein folding, which typically takes more than 100 ms6,7,8,9. As multidomain proteins are naturally abundant and constitute most of the proteomes26, predicting the folding mechanisms of multidomain proteins from native structures is a key problem to be solved. The folding reactions of multidomain proteins often involve multiple folding pathways and molten globule-like compact intermediates6,7,8,9. The intermediates accumulate via a hydrophobic collapse mechanism driven by nonlocal interactions between distant residues27. However, the WSME model does not allow for nonlocal interactions between distant residues in an amino acid sequence unless all intervening residues are folded (Fig.1a, b, d). This precludes the folding of a discontinuous domain, consisting of residues separated in a sequence, prior to the folding of an intervening continuous domain, resulting in a failure to predict the folding mechanisms of multidomain proteins. In addition, the WSME model cannot explicitly consider the folding reactions of disulfide-intact proteins or those involving the oxidative formation of disulfide bonds28, which are typical nonlocal interactions that stabilize many extracellular proteins29. Residues in native or unfolded conformation (mk= 1 or 0) are shown as filled or open circles, respectively.a–cAssumption on native contact formation. In the original WSME model (a), native contact between residuesiandj(red line) is formed only when these residues are connected by a native stretch along main chain; that is, when all intervening residues between them are in native conformation. A nonlocal native contact cannot be formed if two native stretches are not continuously connected along main chain (b). In the WSME-L model (c), nonlocal native contact between residuesiandjseparated in a sequence can be formed if a native stretch between them is continuously connected through a linker shortcut at residuesuandv(blue line), bypassing a long stretch of the main chain.dOriginal WSME model. Contact energy between residuesiandj,εi,j, can be uniform for all residues (Original model 1) or residue-dependent (Original model 2).eWSME-L model for the folding of small and large proteins without disulfide bonds.fWSME-L(SS) model for the folding involving oxidative disulfide bond formation.gWSME-L(SSintact) model for the folding of disulfide-intact proteins. In (e–g), N- and C-terminal regions are shown by magenta circles and the intervening region is shown by blue circles. In (f,g), S denotes a cysteine residue. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simple structure-based statistical mechanical model, named the WSME-L model (L denotes linker), which can introduce virtual linkers corresponding to nonlocal interactions anywhere in a protein molecule (Fig.1c, e). This model improves the prediction of the folding mechanisms of small single-domain proteins compared with the original models. Surprisingly, our model successfully predicts the free energy landscapes that reproduce the experimentally observed folding behaviors of multidomain proteins. In addition, the models with slight modifications, named the WSME-L(SS) and WSME-L(SSintact) models, allow the prediction of the folding processes involving oxidative disulfide bond formation and those of disulfide-intact proteins, respectively (Fig.1f, g). These results suggest that the WSME-L models may pave the way for predicting protein folding mechanisms from native structures without the limitations of size and shape, and will be a useful tool for protein folding prediction in the post-AlphaFold era. In the original WSME model, an Ising-like two-state variable,mk, was assigned to each residue of the protein (mk= 1 for native and 0 for other conformations). The Hamiltonian of the model is defined as: whereNis the number of residues, andεi,jis the contact energy between residuesiandjin the native state10,11,12,13. The protein state\(\{m\}\)represents a set of all residue states,\(\{{m}_{1},{m}_{2},\cdot \cdot \cdot,{m}_{N}\}\), with 2Npossible conformations, and: The free energy landscape can be calculated based on the exact analytical solution of the partition function18. An order parameter, which indicates the degree of native structure formation, was used as the reaction coordinate in the free energy landscape. A partition function restricted by the order parameternis denoted: wherekBis the Boltzmann constant,Tis the temperature, andSi(<0) is the entropic reduction of residueiattributed to the formation of the native conformation.\({{{{{{\rm{Tr}}}}}}}_{n}\)is the sum of all possible states constrained by the value of the order parametern. Two important assumptions were made in the WSME model. One assumption is that a protein is stabilized only by contacts present in the native structure. Another assumption is that native interactions between residuesiandjare established only when all intervening residues fold cooperatively into their native conformations, that is,mi,j= 1 (Fig.1a, b). To consider the nonlocal interactions between the N- and C-termini of a protein, Inanami et al. introduced a virtual linker at both termini23. Inspired by this, we developed a method to introduce a virtual linker between arbitrary residuesuandv(u<v) and established a new model (WSME-L) that can consider all nonlocal interactions in a protein molecule. In this model, to represent nonlocal interactions through a virtual linker, we define\({m}_{i,j}^{(u,v)}\)as follows: where residuesiandjinteract via the linker, if the following two consecutive regions are in their native conformations: (1) from residueitou(or from residueutoi) and (2) from residuevtoj(or from residuejtov) (Fig.1c). Thus, residuesiandjare consecutively connected as a “native stretch” through a linker shortcut, bypassing a long stretch of the main chain. The Hamiltonian of the WSME-L model with a single linker is expressed as follows: where\(\lceil \rceil\)is the ceiling function that prevents double counting. Thus, native contacts can be formed between the residuesiandjif they are connected in a native stretch, either through the main chain (mi,j) or through a linker (\({m}_{i,j}^{(u,v)}\)). To incorporate all interactions present in the native state of a protein, we defined the partition function of the WSME-L model as an ensemble of partition functions with a virtual linker introduced at each inter-residue contact, as follows: where\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\)is a partition function with a virtual linker between residuesuandv, and\({S^{\prime} }^{(u,v)}(n)\)is the entropy penalty corresponding to the reduced number of states owing to the virtual linker formation between residuesuandv(see Methods for details). This WSME-L model corresponds to a generalization of the virtual linker model by Inanami et al.23and can consider all contacts present in the protein. We obtained an exact analytical solution for the partition function of the WSME-L model using the transfer matrix method18(see Methods for details). This solution allows us to calculate rigorous free energy landscapes with greatly reduced computational complexity compared to the direct calculation using Eq. (7). To test whether the WSME-L model (Fig.1e) can predict the folding mechanisms of small single-domain proteins with different topologies, we calculated the free energy landscapes of six small proteins for which the folding mechanisms have been extensively studied experimentally: engrailed homeodomain (En-HD; SCOP2 classification30: all α), src SH3 domain (all β; Fig.2a), α-spectrin SH3 domain (all β), cold shock protein B (CspB; all β), chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2; α + β), and activation domain of human procarboxypeptidase A2 (ADA2h; α + β) (Supplementary Table1; see Methods for detailed calculations). The predictions of the WSME-L model were compared with those of two types of original WSME models: Original model 1 used a uniform contact energy, while Original model 2 used a residue-dependent weighted contact energy similar to that used in the WSME-L model. aNative structure of src SH3 domain.

Source data are provided as a Source data file. The one-dimensional (1D) free energy landscapes predicted by these models indicated two-state folding reactions from the unfolded to the native state for these proteins, in agreement with experimental results31,32,33,34,35,36(Supplementary Figs.1–6for all proteins; the results for the src SH3 domain are also shown in Fig.2as a representative). However, the rate constant for the folding reactionkfand the stability of the folded protein ΔGNUpredicted by the WSME-L model showed higher correlations with the experimental results than those obtained by the original models (Fig.2g, hand Supplementary Fig.7). We also calculated the two-dimensional (2D) free energy landscapes by defining the order parametersn1andn2, corresponding to the degree of structure formation in the N- and C-terminal halves of each protein, respectively, as follows: where\(\{{m}_{1}\}\)and\(\{{m}_{2}\}\)are sets of residue states, andN1andN2are the number of residues in each region. The 2D free energy landscapes indicated that the structured region of each protein in the transition state was mainly localized in the N- or C-terminal half, as suggested by the experiments31,32,33,34,35,36(Fig.2dand Supplementary Figs.1–6). To predict the detailed folding process at the amino acid residue resolution, we performed a theoretical Φ-value analysis (see Methods for details). Φ-value analysis has been widely used to experimentally study residue-specific structure formation during folding31,32,33,34,35,36. Φ = 0 or 1 when the residue is unfolded or fully folded, respectively. The theoretical Φ-values in the folding transition state calculated by the WSME-L model reproduced the experimentally observed Φ-values for all proteins well, and their correlation coefficients were higher than those of the original models (Fig.2e, fand Supplementary Figs.1–6). Interestingly, the WSME-L model can explain the differences in the folding pathways of two proteins with similar structures, src and α-spectrin SH3 domains (Supplementary Figs.2and3). Therefore, the WSME-L model quantitatively improves the prediction accuracy of the folding mechanisms of small proteins compared with the original WSME models. Next, to test whether the WSME-L model (Fig.1e) can predict the folding mechanisms of large multidomain proteins with more than 100 residues, we applied the model to six well-studied proteins: apomyoglobin (apoMb; all α; Fig.3a), barnase (α + β; Fig.3d), ribonuclease HI (RNase HI; α/β; Fig.3g), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; α/β; Fig.3j), α-subunit of tryptophan synthase (αTS; α/β; Fig.3m), and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS; α/β; Fig.3p) (Supplementary Table1; see Methods for detailed calculations). Kinetic folding experiments showed that apoMb accumulates an early folding intermediate in which the A, B, G, and H helices are formed among its eight helices (A–H). This then folds to the native state after forming the C, D, and E helices (Supplementary Fig.8a)37. We calculated the 2D free energy landscape of apoMb using the original and WSME-L models with order parametersn1andn2, which correspond to the degree of structure formation in the A, B, G, and H helices and the C, D, and E helices, respectively. The original models could not predict a free energy landscape consistent with the experimental results (Supplementary Figs.9and10), because they assumed that the continuous region (C, D, and E helices) must fold before the discontinuous region (consisting of A and B helices on the N-terminal side and G and H helices on the C-terminal side). In contrast, the WSME-L model predicted the accumulation of a folding intermediate, in which the A, B, G, and H helices were formed, in the dominant folding pathway of apoMb (Fig.3b). These results agree with the experimental results and are further supported by theoretical Φ-value analysis along the folding pathway (Fig.3c). aNative structure of myoglobin consisting of A, B, G, and H helices (magenta) and C, D, E, and F helices (cyan).bTwo-dimensional (2D) free energy landscape of apomyoglobin (apoMb).n1andn2are order parameters for magenta and cyan regions in (a), respectively.

Source data are provided as a Source data file. For the folding reactions of barnase and RNase HI, the predictions of Original model 1 did not agree with the experimental results38,39(Supplementary Figs.8b, cand11–14). In contrast, the predictions of Original model 2 and the WSME-L model, both of which use residue-dependent weighted contact energies, agreed with the experimental results (Fig.3d–iand Supplementary Figs.8b, cand11–14). However, the WSME-L model better predicted the Φ-values compared with Original model 2 (Supplementary Figs.11and13). DHFR consists of two domains, with one domain (the adenosine-binding domain, ABD) inserted into the other (the discontinuous loop domain, DLD) (Fig.3j). Experiments have shown that the ABD of DHFR folds first, followed by DLD, and finally, both dock to form the native state via multiple folding pathways (Supplementary Fig.8d)40. Although the original models did not explain this reaction (Supplementary Figs.15–16), the extended WSME model with a single virtual linker between the N- and C-termini partially explained the experimental results23. However, the predicted intermediates were unstable, and multiple folding pathways were not predicted. In contrast, our WSME-L model reproduced the accumulation of stable intermediates, in which only ABD was formed, and the presence of multiple folding pathways (Fig.3k, land Supplementary Figs.15and16). αTS (268 residues) and IGPS (223 residues) are among the largest proteins whose folding mechanisms have been studied in detail by experiment41,42. They have similar native structures and show parallel folding pathways involving on-pathway intermediates, but their detailed structures differ between αTS and IGPS (Supplementary Fig.8e, f). For αTS, all three models predicted the presence of two parallel pathways (Fig.3nand Supplementary Figs.17and18). However, only the WSME-L model was able to predict the formation of both N- and C-terminal regions in the on-pathway intermediate (Fig.3oand Supplementary Figs.17and18). Remarkably, although the original models failed to reproduce the experimentally observed folding processes of IGPS (Supplementary Figs.19and20), the WSME-L model successfully reproduced the parallel pathways in IGPS folding (Fig.3q) and accurately predicted the structure of the on-pathway intermediate in which strands 2–6 and helices 2–5 are formed (Fig.3r). Again, the WSME-L model can distinguish subtle differences in folding mechanisms even for large proteins with similar structures. In summary, the WSME-L model, which considers all nonlocal interactions, can predict the folding free energy landscapes of small to large proteins of different shapes in a unified manner. Disulfide bonds are typical nonlocal interactions that stabilize a protein covalently and are present in many extracellular proteins or domains secreted outside cells29. Folding of such proteins involves oxidative disulfide bond formation. Oxidative folding reactions of RNase A and other proteins have long been studied experimentally, leading to Anfinsen’s dogma that the amino acid sequence of a protein determines its native structure43. The WSME-L model can be modified to predict oxidative folding by considering the stabilization contact energy corresponding to disulfide bond formation when a virtual linker is created between two native Cys pairs (Fig.1f; see Methods for details). We applied this model, named the WSME-L(SS) model, to three representative proteins for oxidative folding studies: hen egg-white lysozyme (α + β; four disulfide bonds; Fig.4a), RNase A (α + β; four disulfide bonds; Fig.4d), and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI; small; three disulfide bonds; Fig.4g). We also calculated the degree of disulfide bond formation between the residuesiandjduring folding,\({\Phi }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{SS}}}}}}}\)(see Methods for details). The WSME-L(SS) model predictions described below are consistent with the experimental results and reveal complex behaviors in forming multiple disulfide bonds during folding that were not predicted by the original models (Supplementary Figs.21–27). Note that although the WSME-L(SS) model cannot simulate non-native disulfide bond formation because it considers only native contacts, experimental studies demonstrate that well-populated intermediates in oxidative folding contain only native disulfide bonds44, which can be explained by our model. aNative structure of lysozyme. α-domain (residues 1–39 and 86–129) and β-domain (residues 40–85) are shown in magenta and cyan, respectively.

Source data are provided as a Source data file. Lysozyme is one of the best studied multidomain proteins in terms of protein folding. It consists of two domains: a discontinuous α-domain (residues 1–39 and 86–129) and a continuous β-domain (residues 40–85) (Fig.4a). It has four disulfide bonds: two (6–127 and 30–115) in the α-domain, one (64–80) in the β-domain, and one (76–94) in the interdomain region. Oxidative folding experiments with lysozyme revealed two parallel folding pathways: the major pathway accumulates two intermediates, named des[76–94] and des[64–80], in which three disulfide bonds other than 76–94 and 64–80 are formed, respectively, whereas the minor pathway involves the des[6–127] intermediate (Supplementary Fig.21a)45. The WSME-L(SS) model predicted that the oxidative folding of lysozyme starts with forming the 64–80 disulfide bond in the β-domain and proceeds through two contrasting pathways (Fig.4b, c). In the major pathway (Pathway 1), as the preformed 64–80 disulfide bond is reduced, the 30–115 and then the 6–127 disulfide bonds are formed in the α-domain. Subsequently, during the repeated formation and reduction of the 76–94 disulfide bond, the 64–80 and finally the 76–94 disulfide bonds were formed in the β-domain, corresponding to the des[76–94] and des[64–80] intermediates observed in the experiments. In contrast, the minor pathway (Pathway 2) favored the formation of the 64–80 and then the 76–94 disulfide bonds in the β-domain, followed by the formation of the 30–115 and then the 6–127 disulfide bonds in the α-domain. This corresponds to the des[6–127] intermediate observed experimentally. The prediction of the oxidative folding of RNase A by the WSME-L(SS) model agrees with the experimental results (Supplementary Fig.21b)46as follows: in the early stages of folding, the 65–72 disulfide bond was strongly favored among the four native disulfide bonds (Fig.4f). RNase A folded along two parallel pathways (Fig.4e). In Pathway 1, the initially formed 65–72 disulfide bond was broken in the middle stage and regenerated in the late stage of folding (Fig.4f). In Pathway 2, a 40–95 disulfide bond was formed in the final step (Fig.4f). Surprisingly, the WSME-L(SS) model successfully reproduced the oxidative folding experiments of BPTI under conditions where the glutathione concentrations are close to those in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.4h, iand Supplementary Fig.21c)47,48. The predictions showed that BPTI has a high propensity to form a single disulfide intermediate, named [14–38], with a disulfide bond between residues 14 and 38 early in the folding reaction, but in the middle stage of folding (n> 0.4) it forms the [30–51] intermediate, followed by a two-disulfide [30–51; 14–38] intermediate (Fig.4i). BPTI then folds into its native state via two pathways, both involving the additional formation of a 5–55 disulfide bond (Fig.4h, i). Interestingly, Pathway 1 predicted the partial breakage of the 14–38 disulfide bond before the formation of all the disulfide bonds. This is consistent with the experimental results observed at low concentrations of oxidized glutathione, where the 14–38 disulfide bond is transiently reduced before forming the native state44. Because oxidative folding measurements have limited temporal resolution, many experimental studies of protein folding have been performed on disulfide-intact proteins, in which all disulfide bonds are preformed prior to folding experiments. This enables a detailed investigation of folding kinetics with high temporal resolution using various experimental methods. To predict the folding reactions of disulfide-intact proteins, we constructed the WSME-L(SSintact) model, which allows WSME-L predictions in the presence of covalent linker(s) (Fig.1g; see Methods for details). We applied this model to predict the folding of disulfide-intact lysozyme, RNase A, and BPTI. Kinetic folding experiments on disulfide-intact lysozyme revealed a complex folding behavior involving a collapsed intermediate and two subsequent parallel pathways (Fig.5aand Supplementary Fig.28a)49,50,51,52. The major slow folding pathway accumulates the α-domain intermediate in which the discontinuous α-domain is formed but not the continuous β-domain, whereas in the minor fast folding pathway the collapsed intermediate folds directly to the native state with simultaneous formation of α- and β-domains. This behavior was not explained by the original WSME models, which predicted that the α-domain was formed only after the formation of the β-domain (Supplementary Figs.29and30). Strikingly, the WSME-L(SSintact) model predicted the presence of two intermediates (I1and I2) and two dominant folding pathways, in agreement with the experimental results (Fig.5b–d). In the I1intermediate, the B- and D-helices in the α-domain are partially formed, while in the I2intermediate in Pathway 1, the α-domain is mostly folded but the β-domain is not (Fig.5b, c). In contrast, in Pathway 2, after the formation of I1, the β-domain and then the rest of the α-domain are formed through a downhill landscape without accumulation of stable intermediates (Fig.5b, d). These predictions are consistent with the experimental results and provide detailed insights into the residue-specific structure formation during lysozyme folding. aFolding mechanism of experimentally elucidated hen egg-white lysozyme49,50,51,52.bTwo-dimensional (2D) free energy landscape of lysozyme predicted by WSME-L model under folding conditions at 293 K.n1andn2are order parameters for α- and β-domains, respectively.

Blue curve: prediction by WSME-L(SSintact) model. Red filled circles: experimental data54. Source data are provided as a Source data file. Kinetic analysis based on the 2D free energy landscape predicted that 91% and 9% of lysozyme molecules fold through Pathways 1 and 2, respectively (Fig.5e; see Methods for details). Pathway 1 is favored due to a lower free energy barrier (TS1) than Pathway 2 (TS3) (Fig.5b). However, folding via Pathway 1 is slower because it has to overcome a rate-limiting free energy barrier (TS2) to reach the native state (Fig.5b, c, e). This provides a rationale for the experimental observations of a major but slow folding pathway and a minor but fast folding pathway. In addition, the time evolution of α- and β-domain structure formation, calculated by combining the kinetic and theoretical Φ-value analyses, showed that α-domain folding precedes β-domain folding, reproducing the experimental results (Fig.5g). Thermodynamic analysis predicted that the I2intermediate is destabilized at high temperatures (Fig.5fand Supplementary Figs.31–35), consistent with experimental results showing that the population of the α-domain intermediate is reduced at high temperatures53. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent changes in the heat capacity of lysozyme obtained from equilibrium unfolding experiments54were well reproduced by our model (Fig.5h). To further investigate the role of each disulfide bond in determining the folding pathways, we calculated the free energy landscapes of lysozyme variants containing only a single disulfide bond using the WSME-L(SSintact) model (Supplementary Fig.36). We found that the disulfide bonds in the α-domain, especially the 30–115 disulfide bond, are critical for making Pathway 1 the major folding pathway (Supplementary Fig.36). This finding is consistent with experimental studies showing that the two disulfide bonds in the α-domain are essential for the accumulation of the α-domain intermediate (corresponding to I2)55. We also applied the WSME-L(SSintact) model to predict the folding of disulfide-intact RNase A and BPTI (Supplementary Figs.37–40). RNase A has twocisPro residues (Pro93 and Pro114) in its native state and shows very fast folding reactions when starting from the Uvfunfolded state in which both Pro residues are incisconformations (Supplementary Fig.28b)56. The model predicted the formation of helix 2 and the N-terminal side of the β-sheet in the intermediate, but not residues 50–75 and the C-terminal side of the β-sheet (Supplementary Figs.37and38). In addition, stabilization of the entire helix 1 occurs only in the final step. These predictions well reproduce the structure of the IΦintermediate that accumulates in the folding reaction from Uvf56. For disulfide-intact BPTI, the model predicted a folding pathway similar to oxidative folding; however, the presence of the intact disulfide bonds stabilized the protein, resulting in a downhill folding with a minimal transition state barrier (Supplementary Figs.39and40). Since kinetic folding experiments for disulfide-intact BPTI are not available, this prediction requires experimental verification. In this study, we developed a simple structure-based theoretical model (WSME-L) to predict protein folding mechanisms by introducing virtual linkers at arbitrary positions to enhance nonlocal interactions. Applying the original WSME models to predict folding processes has been limited to small proteins and multidomain proteins with close N- and C-termini, such as DHFR12,13,23. In contrast, our model can be applied to a wide variety of proteins, regardless of size and shape. For small single-domain proteins, the WSME-L model outperformed the original models in terms of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the WSME-L, WSME-L(SS), and WSME-L(SSintact) models successfully predicted the folding pathways of large multidomain proteins, folding with oxidative disulfide bond formation, and folding of disulfide-intact proteins, respectively. Notably, the results are consistent with the experimental results, a feat that was not achieved with the original models. The success of these predictions substantiates the importance of nonlocal interactions in predicting folding mechanisms, particularly for multidomain proteins17,23,27,57. In addition, the models yielded detailed predictions of folding processes beyond reproducing the experimental results and provided the key determinants and rationale for the folding mechanisms. An important assumption of the WSME model is that a protein is stabilized only by the contacts present in the native structure. The same assumption is employed in an ideal protein based on the consistency principle proposed by Gō58and in the perfect funnel-like energy landscape based on the principle of minimal frustration proposed by Wolynes, Onuchic, and colleagues59. Despite their simplicity, WSME models successfully predict the folding mechanisms of single-domain and multidomain proteins. These results suggest that both the consistency and minimal frustration principles hold for many proteins, regardless of their size. This suggests that real proteins behave similarly to ideal proteins regarding folding kinetics and thermodynamics. Detailed comparisons of predicted and experimental data reveal slight differences between ideal and real proteins due to non-native interactions and Pro isomerization during folding. In disulfide-intact lysozyme folding, non-native interactions stabilize the α-domain intermediate (I2) and retard the subsequent folding process51. The WSME-L prediction underestimated the maximum population of I2(~45%) compared to the experimental results (~60%)53(Fig.5e), but this discrepancy can be resolved by accounting for the stabilization effect of non-native interactions by 0.44 kcal/mol (Supplementary Fig.41). In αTS and IGPS folding, off-pathway intermediates formed early in folding by non-native interactions must be disrupted before folding to the native state41,42. In addition,cisPro residues in the native state of αTS, IGPS, and RNase A must isomerize fromtranstocisconformations during folding if they are intransconformations in the unfolded state, resulting in the appearance of additional parallel folding pathways41,42,56. However, the WSME-L models predicted only the folding pathways involving on-pathway intermediates with native-like Pro conformations because they only consider native contacts. Similarly, the WSME-L(SS) model predicted that the 40–95 disulfide bond is formed together with the 26–84 disulfide bond in the final step of oxidative RNase A folding, whereas experiments have shown that the final step of the folding involves only the formation of the 40–95 disulfide bond46. This may be because the slowtrans-to-cisisomerization of Pro93 near the 40–95 disulfide bond60, which is not considered in the WSME-L(SS) model, delays the formation of this disulfide. Thus, the WSME-L models are useful for capturing the general features of the folding mechanisms of ideal proteins, and slight discrepancies between the predicted and experimental data can provide clues to understanding the role of non-native interactions/conformations in protein folding. Future efforts to incorporate non-native interactions and Pro isomerization into the models would allow for even greater accuracy in predicting protein folding mechanisms. Theoretical approaches to predicting three-dimensional protein structures have been greatly advanced by deep learning1,2, making considerable progress toward solving the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’3. Although these algorithms do not predict how proteins fold and function, WSME-L models can predict the folding mechanisms of various proteins, without the limitations of size and shape, with low computational complexity, using only native structures solved experimentally or with deep learning algorithms. Moreover, because the WSME-L model can describe protein dynamics in terms of free energy landscapes, it has a wide range of potential applications beyond protein folding, including the dynamic motions associated with protein function19,20,22, protein–protein interactions, and coupled folding and binding of intrinsically disordered proteins61. Furthermore, it would be applicable to the development of novel protein design methods based on dynamics prediction. Therefore, the WSME-L models may pave the way for solving the folding process component of the ‘protein folding problem’3and will be increasingly useful in the forthcoming era of computational biology. The native contact energy between residuesiandj,\({\varepsilon }_{i,j}\), was obtained as\({\varepsilon }_{i,j}=\varepsilon {e}_{i,j}\), where\(\varepsilon\)is the energy size of the inter-residue contacts in a protein and\({e}_{i,j}\)\((-1\le {e}_{i,j}\le 1)\)is the weight of the contact energy between residuesiandj. The\({e}_{i,j}\)values were determined as follows: first, the three-dimensional structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) was energy minimized using AMBER18/ff14SB with restraints for backbone atoms62. In Original model 1,\({e}_{i,j}=-1\)if an atom in residueiis within 4 Å of an atom in residuej; otherwise\({e}_{i,j}=0\). In Original model 2, using the energy-minimized structure, the AMBER-derived contact energy\({\varepsilon }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{AMBER}}}}}}}\)was calculated using the MMPBSA.py module for implicit solvents62.\({e}_{i,j}\)was defined as\({\varepsilon }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{AMBER}}}}}}}\)divided by the maximum absolute value of\({\varepsilon }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{AMBER}}}}}}}\)among all inter-residue contacts excluding those with neighboring residues\((j\le i+2)\). The WSME-L model has two types of partition functions:\(Z(n)\)and\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\)(see Eq. (7)). The\({e}_{i,j}\)values in\(Z(n)\)were the same as those used in Original model 2.\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\)is described as: In\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\), the contact energy acquired by the virtual linker formation between residuesuandv,\({\varepsilon ^{\prime} }^{(u,v)}\), was defined as\({\varepsilon ^{\prime} }^{(u,v)}=\varepsilon ({e}_{u,v}+{e}_{u+1,v}+{e}_{u-1,v}+{e}_{u,v+1}+{e}_{u,v-1})\). The\({e}_{i,j}\)values for\({H}^{(u,v)}(\{m\})\)in\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\)were the same as in\(Z(n)\), except that\({e}_{u,v}={e}_{u\pm 1,v}={e}_{u,v\pm 1}=0\)to avoid double counting. For all models,\({e}_{i,j}=0\)for neighboring residues (\(j\le i+2\)). In the predictions of folding with oxidative disulfide bond formation, –40 kcal/mol was added to\({\varepsilon }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{AMBER}}}}}}}\)for the residue pair forming a disulfide bond in Original model 2 and the WSME-L(SS) model. In Original model 1, the change in contact energy corresponding to the addition of –40 kcal/mol in Original model 2 was added to the contact energy for the disulfide pair. To predict the folding of disulfide-intact proteins using the WSME-L(SSintact) model,\({e}_{i,j}={e}_{i\pm 1,j}={e}_{i,j\pm 1}=0\)for the residue pairsiandjforming a disulfide bond. It is important to note that the use of native contact energies calculated by the AMBER force field was necessary to obtain the free energy landscape consistent with the experimental data. For disulfide-intact lysozyme, the landscape calculated using a uniform contact energy predicted only a single folding pathway corresponding to Pathway 1 (Supplementary Fig.42). This inconsistency with the experiments is a marked contrast with previous studies in which residue-specific weighing on contact energies in an Ising-like coarse-grained model had a small contribution to the folding prediction of small proteins13,57. These results suggest the importance of side-chain packing interactions in determining the folding mechanisms of multidomain proteins. The three-dimensional structure used to calculate the contact energies of apoMb was determined as follows: the all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of apoMb with heme removed from the heme-bound structure were performed using GROMACS 2021.2 with ff14SB for 1 μs with explicit solvents, as only heme-bound myoglobin structures were available from PDB63,64. The initial structure was built using the LEaP module of the AmberTools19 package with ff14SB62and the crystal structure of myoglobin (PDB ID:1bzp) as input. All ionizable side chains were set to their pH 7 protonation state. Charge-neutralizing chloride ions were placed around the protein molecule. The protein molecule was immersed in a 70.4 × 65.9 × 70.6 Å3periodic box of TIP3P water molecules (7680 water molecules and 25,501 atoms in total). The long-range electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle-mesh Ewald method. The systems were energy minimized by the steepest descent algorithm for 200 steps with positional restraints and for additional 200 steps without restraints64. The system was then heated from 0 K to 310 K during a 200-ps constant-NVT MD simulation with harmonic position restraints on the heavy atoms of the solutes (with a force constant of 10 kcal mol−1A−2). During the subsequent 700-ps constant-NPT MD simulation at 310 K and 1.0 × 105Pa, the force constants of the position restraints were gradually reduced. The system was further equilibrated for 100 ps without position restraints. The bonds between hydrogen atoms and heavy atoms were constrained using the P-LINCS algorithm, allowing the use of 2-fs time steps. Temperature was controlled using the stochastic velocity-rescaling (V-rescale) algorithm. Pressure in NPT simulations was controlled using a Berendsen barostat with a coupling constant of 1 ps-164. The time-course analysis showed that the energy of the system was well converged during equilibration. Subsequently, an unrestrained constant-NPT MD simulation was performed for 1 μs at 310 K and 1.0 × 105Pa using a Parrinello-Rahman barostat with a coupling constant of 2 ps−164, and the native ensembles of apoMb were obtained. The MD trajectories were analyzed using the CPPTRAJ module in AmberTools1962. The 1-μs MD simulations were performed in triplicate under the same conditions. The three independent MD trajectories represented by a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the main-chain Cα atoms from the initial structure were similar (Supplementary Fig.43a), and the average RMSD in each trajectory was almost the same for all trajectories, indicating the reproducibility of the MD simulations (Supplementary Fig.43b). We then performed cluster analysis on 3000 structures taken every 1 ns from a total of 3-μs simulations with an RMSD cutoff of 1.6 Å65. The central structure of the first cluster was used as a computational model of apoMb to calculate contact energies; the PDB file of the apoMb structure is provided as Supplementary Data1. As the F helix of apoMb does not form a stable structure in the native state66, the contact energies involving the residues in the F helix were set to zero. The resulting free energy landscape was consistent with the experimentally observed folding mechanisms of apoMb (Fig.3b, c), indicating that both the accuracy and timescale of the MD simulation are sufficient for the present study. The entropic cost of the main chain of thei-th residue,Si, was set to –2.0 cal/(mol·K) for Original model 1, –2.5 cal/(mol·K) for Original model 2, and –3.5 cal/(mol·K) for the WSME-L models. The entropic cost of ring closure via virtual linker formation,\({S^{\prime} }^{(u,v)}(n)\), was calculated as follows: let us consider a Gaussian chain with a chain length ofLa, whereLis a natural number, anda(3.8 Å) is the distance between two adjacent Cα atoms. The entropic cost of ring closure between the two termini of this chain is: whereA(20 Å) is the persistence length of a peptide chain, andris the distance between the Cα atoms of the two termini of the chain23. Using this, we defined\({S^{\prime} }^{(u,v)}(n)\)as the arithmetic mean of the entropic cost\(s^{\prime}\)for all possible states as follows: where\(N^{\prime}=v-u+1\),\({h}_{S^{\prime} }\)is a scaling factor of the ring entropy, and\(()\)denotes a combination. The folding rate and stability of small proteins were calculated from the 1D free energy landscape according to previous studies67. The microscopic rate constant for the transition from a structure withnNnative contacts (order parametern) to one withnN± 1 native contacts (order parametern± 1/N) can be described by: whereA= 107andF(n) is the 1D free energy at order parametern. The macroscopic rate constant was obtained as the eigenvalue with the smallest nonzero absolute value of the following rate matrix: Under conditions in which the native state is sufficiently stable relative to the unfolded state, the macroscopic rate constant is equivalent to the folding rate constantkf. The stability of the small proteins,\(\Delta {G}_{{{{{{\rm{NU}}}}}}}\), was estimated as the difference between the minimum free energy values of the native and unfolded state basins in a 1D free energy landscape at 293 K or 298 K. In the present WSME-L models, the parameters to be determined for each protein are\(\varepsilon\)and\({h}_{S^{\prime} }\). To determine these values for small proteins, the\({h}_{S^{\prime} }\)was set to 0.5–2.0 in increments of 0.1, and for each of them, the\(\varepsilon\)was determined that minimized the following loss function for the stability and folding rate between the experimentally determined and predicted values: Among the pairs of\({h}_{S^{\prime} }\)and\(\varepsilon\)thus obtained, we selected a pair for which the theoretical Φ-values correlate best with the experimental values. Similarly, for other proteins, we searched for the pairs of\({h}_{S^{\prime} }\)and\(\varepsilon\)that minimized the loss function for the stability between the experimentally determined and predicted values: Among them, we selected a pair for which the theoretical Φ-values and stability of folding intermediates correlate best with the experimental values. See Supplementary Table2for the\(\varepsilon\)and\({h}_{S^{\prime} }\)values used for each protein. The exact solution of\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\)(see Eq. (9)) was obtained by rearranging the exact solution of the original WSME model18. First, we considered the Boltzmann weight of a native stretch, as follows: whereλis an indeterminant whose exponent is related to the order parametern. For convenience in later calculations, we define\({w}_{i+1,i}=1\). To reduce computational complexity, virtual linkers were introduced only for residuesiandjwith interaction energies\({\varepsilon }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{AMBER}}}}}}}\)less than –0.6. According to the exact solution of the original WSME model, the generating function of the partition functionZ, restricted by an order parametern, is written as: Here,\({Q}_{\mu+1}^{\mu }\)was a transfer matrix defined as: where\({|k\rangle }{}^{\mu }\)is a (μ+ 1)-dimensional vector whose set satisfies the orthonormal system: wherek,k´= 0, 1, ···,μ. From the generating function, the partition function restricted by the order parameter is formally given as follows: When calculating high-dimensional free energy landscapes, more indeterminants with proper exponents should be prepared similarly. Next, when a linker is provided, the additional weights corresponding to the interactions between the two native stretches connected by the linker should be considered. The introduction of a linker connecting residuesuandvimplied that an additional weight,\({w}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}^{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta }\), should be multiplied when calculating the products of\({w}_{\alpha,\beta }\)(\(\alpha \le u\le \beta\)) and\({w}_{\gamma,\delta }\)(\(\gamma \le v\le \delta\)). The additional weight is given as: For convenience in later calculations, we defined that\({w}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}^{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta }=1\)when\(u \, < \, \alpha\)or\(\beta \, < \, u\). The products of\({w}_{\alpha,\beta }\)and\({w}_{\gamma,\delta }\)must be extracted to calculate the partition function using additional weights. To achieve this, we insert a unit matrix into the generating function as follows: By rearranging this expression according to the definition of the transfer matrix, the generating function can be expanded as: with: where\(\gamma=v-k+1\). Indexγruns from 1 tov, and indexδruns fromvtoN. This means we can extract all the weights, including for thev-th residue (i.e.,\({w}_{\gamma,v}\)and\({w}_{v,\delta }\)). We then obtained\({R}_{\gamma,\delta }^{0,\gamma -1}\)by converting all the weights,\({w}_{i,j}\), included in\({R}^{0,\gamma -1}\)into\({w}_{i,j}{w}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}^{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta }\). This allowed us to calculate the generating function with a linker,\({G}_{{Z}^{(u,v)}}\), which is given by: The contact maps and free energy landscapes were drawn using Mathematica 12.2 (Wolfram, Champaign, IL, USA). In protein folding experiments, residue-specific structure formation has been extensively studied using Φ-value analysis, which requires the measurement of free energy changes in intermediates and transition states due to an amino acid substitution at the residue of interest68. Here, we performed a theoretical Φ-value analysis by introducing a small perturbation in the contact energies of thel-th residue, equivalent to an amino acid substitution, and calculated the free energy landscape, which corresponded to the kinetic folding measurements of the mutant. The difference in free energy between the perturbed and unperturbed landscapes along a folding pathway was normalized by the total free energy change due to the perturbation, resulting in theoretical Φ-values (Φth,l): Φth,l= 0 or 1 when thel-th residue was unfolded or fully folded, respectively. The Φth,lvalues in the intermediate or transition states corresponded to the experimentally observed Φ-values. A theoretical Φ-value analysis of the original WSME model has been performed elsewhere13. To apply this to the WSME-L model, we defined the perturbations at thel-th amino acid residue as follows: where\({\eta }_{i,l}\)and\({\eta }_{l,j}\)are the contact energy changes due to small perturbations in the native contacts involving thel-th residue. All interactions formed by thel-th residue were simultaneously modulated;\({\eta }_{i,j}=0.1|{\varepsilon }_{i,\, j}|\)for\({\varepsilon }_{i,\, j} \, < \, 0\), while\({\eta }_{i,\, j}=0\)for\({\varepsilon }_{i,\, j} \, > \, 0\). The partition function with perturbations owing to such a pseudo-mutation was described as follows: where Mu denotes mutation at thel-th residue, and: Φth,lis obtained as follows: When the value is less than zero, Φth,lis set to zero. \({Z}_{l}^{{{{{{\rm{Mu\,}}}}}}(u,v)}(n)\)was obtained using the exact solution of the WSME-L model. First, to consider the change in the free energy of a native stretch including thel-th residue connected along the main chain, all weights\({w}_{i,j}\)in the transfer matrices were replaced by\({w}_{i,j}\exp [-({\sum }_{i\le s\le l}{\eta }_{s,l}+{\sum }_{l\le t\le j}{\eta }_{l,t})/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T]\). Second, to consider the change in free energy of a native stretch connected via a linker to another native stretch including thel-th residue, all weights\({w}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}^{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta }\)in the transfer matrices were replaced by\({w}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}^{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta }\exp [-({\sum }_{\gamma \le t\le \delta }{\eta }_{l,t})/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T]\)when\(\alpha \le l\le \beta\)or by\({w}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}^{\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta }\exp [-({\sum }_{\alpha \le s\le \beta }{\eta }_{s,l})/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T]\)when\(\gamma \le l\le \delta\). This modification of the weights allowed us to calculate\({Z}_{l}^{{{{{{\rm{Mu\,}}}}}}(u,v)}(n)\)efficiently. Among the experimentally determined Φ-values, we used the data of the mutants with a destabilization free energy\(\Delta \Delta {G}_{{{{{{\rm{NU}}}}}}}^{\exp }\)of more than 0.7 kcal/mol by amino acid substitution to compare the predictions with those of the experiments68. To calculate the degree of disulfide bond formation between residuesiandjduring folding,\({\Phi }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{SS}}}}}}}(n)\), we defined the perturbation at the contact between residuesiandjthat form a disulfide bond as follows: Similar to the calculation of Φth-values, the partition function with the perturbation is described by: where: and: \({Z}_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{Mu\,}}}}}}(u,v)}(n)\)was obtained using the exact solution of the WSME-L model.\({\Phi }_{i,j}^{{{{{{\rm{SS}}}}}}}(n)\)was calculated as follows: The partition function for disulfide-intact folding,\({Z}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}^{{{{{{\rm{SSintact}}}}}}}(n)\), was constructed by slightly modifying\({Z}_{{{{{{\rm{L}}}}}}}(n)\)for the WSME-L model. First, the Hamiltonian with two linkers at the two residue pairs (u1,v1) and (u2,v2) was given by: The partition function with double linkers, can be computed using the same solution as for the partition function with a single linker,\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\), by expanding the generating function with the insertion of two unit matrices,\(\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k=0}^{{v}_{1}}{|k\rangle }{}^{{v}_{1}}\,{}^{{v}_{1}}\langle k|\)and\(\mathop{\sum }\limits_{k=0}^{{v}_{2}}{|k\rangle }{}^{{v}_{2}}\,{}^{{v}_{2}}\langle k|\), as in Eq. (22), and by introducing an additional weight to the weight stabilized by the linker. Using this equation, the partition function for the disulfide-intact folding was defined as follows: where the summation of (u2, v2) was calculated for all residue pairs that formed a disulfide bond in a protein. For example, (u2, v2) = (6, 127), (30, 115), (76, 94), and (64, 80) for lysozyme, which has disulfide bonds at 6–127, 30–115, 76–94, and 64–80. In contrast, the summation of (u1,v1) was calculated for all nonlocal interactions present in the native state. In addition, the contributions of multiple disulfide bonds were considered by summing the partition functions for all the disulfide bonds. The typical time required to calculate a 2D free energy landscape using the WSME-L model was 13 s for src SH3 domain (60 residues) on a standard desktop computer and 4,680 s for αTS (268 residues) on a 128 CPU parallel supercomputer at the Supercomputer Center, the Institute for Solid State Physics, the University of Tokyo (ISSP). The typical time required to calculate a 2D free energy landscape with the WSME-L(SSintact) model was 74 s for BPTI (58 residues, three disulfide bonds) on a standard desktop computer and 3,180 s for RNase A (124 residues, four disulfide bonds) on the 128 CPU parallel supercomputer at ISSP. The calculation of the degree of residue-specific structure formation for theoretical Φ-value analysis requires the above computation time multiplied by the number of residues. The microscopic rate constant of the reaction from state X to Y was given by\({k}_{{{{{{\rm{XY}}}}}}}=A({n}_{{{\ddagger}} })\exp (-\Delta {F}_{{{{{{\rm{XY}}}}}}}^{{{\ddagger}} }/{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T)\), where\(\Delta {F}_{{{{{{\rm{XY}}}}}}}^{{{\ddagger}} }\)is the free energy difference between state X and the transition state and is obtained from the 2D free energy landscape.\(A({n}_{{{\ddagger}} })\)is a pre-exponential factor for crossing the transition state at order parameter\({n}_{{{\ddagger}} }\). This value was calculated as\(A(n)={A}_{0}/(1+5Q(n))\)considering internal friction23,69.\(Q\)is the degree of contact formation during the folding process. Since this number is approximately proportional to the square of the number of residues, we used\(Q={n}^{2}\,(0\le n\le 1,\,0\le Q\le 1)\)for simplicity.\({A}_{0}\)was determined to simulate the experimentally observed folding rates at 293 K52. The time-dependent changes in the concentrations of U, I1, I2, and N were calculated as described below. The kinetic analysis was performed according to the following scheme: which gives the following matrix equation: where\({{{{{\bf{C}}}}}}=\left(\begin{array}{l}{{{{{\rm{U}}}}}}\\ {{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}\\ {{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}\\ {{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}\end{array}\right)\)and\({{{{{\bf{M}}}}}}=-\left(\begin{array}{cccc}-{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{UI}}}}}}}_{1}} & {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}{{{{{\rm{U}}}}}}} & 0 & 0\\ {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{UI}}}}}}}_{1}} & -{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}{{{{{\rm{U}}}}}}}-{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}}-{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}{{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}} & {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}} & {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{NI}}}}}}}_{1}}\\ 0 & {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}} & -{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}}-{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}{{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}} & {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{NI}}}}}}}_{2}}\\ 0 & {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}{{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}} & {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}{{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}} & -{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{NI}}}}}}}_{1}}-{k}_{{{{{{{\rm{NI}}}}}}}_{2}}\end{array}\right)\). Under native conditions, where the free energy barriers between N and TS3and between N and TS2are large, both\({k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{1}{{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}}\gg {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{NI}}}}}}}_{1}}\)and\({k}_{{{{{{{\rm{I}}}}}}}_{2}{{{{{\rm{N}}}}}}}\gg {k}_{{{{{{{\rm{NI}}}}}}}_{2}}\)are satisfied. Then, we can neglect the unfolding of the native state, as follows: In this scheme, the concentrations of the native states formed through Pathways 1 and 2 are denoted as Np1and Np2, respectively. Here, vectorCand the matrixMin Eq. (42) are written as follows: The matrix equation was solved analytically using Mathematica 12.2 (Wolfram), and the time-dependent changes in U, I1, I2, Np1, Np2, and N (= Np1+ Np2) were obtained under the following initial conditions: U(0) = 1 and I1(0) = I2(0) = Np1(0) = Np2(0) = 0. The theoretical Φ-values provided the degree of residue-specific structure formation in the U, I1, I2, and N states of the lysozyme. Using these values, the degrees of α- and β-domain structure formation, Φth,αand Φth,β, were obtained by calculating the average of the Φth-values for the residues involved in the α- and β-domains, respectively. For comparison with experiments49, the following residues were used for the α-domain: residues 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 23, 27, 28, 29, 31, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 108, 111, 112, 115, 123, 124, and 125, while the following residues were used for the β-domain: residues 40, 42, 44, 50, 52, 53, 56, 58, 61, 63, 64, 65, 75, 76, 78, 82, 83, and 84. Combined with the kinetic analysis, the time evolution of the domain-specific structure formation for the α- and β-domains,\({p}_{{{{{{\rm{\alpha }}}}}}}(t)\)and\({p}_{{{{{{\rm{\beta }}}}}}}(t)\), respectively, during folding was obtained as follows: wherenU,\({n}_{{{{\rm{I}}}}_{1}}\),\({n}_{{{{\rm{I}}}}_{2}}\), andnNare the order parameters of the U, I1, I2, and N states, respectively. The temperature dependence of the heat capacityC(T) was obtained from the partition function as follows: For comparison with the experimental data from differential scanning calorimetry54, 8 kcal/(mol·K) was added as a baseline. According to previous studies on solvation free energy, the temperature dependence of the contact energy size,\(\varepsilon\), of lysozyme was defined as follows: whereTfwas 293 K70.\({\varepsilon }_{{{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}}[=\varepsilon ({T}_{{{{{{\rm{f}}}}}}})]\)was set to 1.783 to satisfy the stability of lysozyme (\(\Delta {G}_{{{{{{\rm{NU}}}}}}}=16{k}_{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}T\)) atTf.pandqwere set to –0.307 and 11.3 to satisfy\(\Delta {G}_{{{{{{\rm{NU}}}}}}}({T}_{{{{{{\rm{m}}}}}}})=0\)at a midpoint temperature of thermal unfolding (Tm= 350 K) and match the heat capacity observed in experiments54. Generalization of the Hamiltonian with two linkers in the WSME-L(SSintact) model yields a Hamiltonian for proteins with multiple linkers. The presence ofLlinkers at the residue pairs of (u1,v1), (u2,v2), ···, and (uL,vL), in addition to the main chain, provides (L+ 1) possible ways to connect the residuesiandj. Accordingly, the Hamiltonian for multiple linkers is described as follows: The partition function for this Hamiltonian can be solved by repeatedly applying the exact solution for the partition function with a single linker\({Z}^{(u,v)}(n)\), as many times as the number of linkers. We extracted the appropriate weights from the generating function and introduced additional weights corresponding to the new linkers into the original weights similarly extracted. However, as the number of linkers increased, the formula became more complex, and the computation time increased. The folding processes of disulfide-intact lysozyme obtained using this method (Supplementary Fig.44) were almost the same as those obtained using the WSME-L(SSintact) model (Fig.5). As the simultaneous introduction of more than three disulfide bonds complicates the calculations, the WSME-L(SSintact) model is suitable for predicting the folding of disulfide-intact proteins.

To function properly, many proteins must fold into specific structures. However, the way proteins fold into specific structures is still largely unknown. Researchers from the University of Tokyo developed a novel physical theory that can accurately predict how proteins fold. Their model can predict things previous models cannot. Improved knowledge of protein folding could offer huge benefits to medical research, as well as to various industrial processes.
You are literally made of proteins. These chainlike molecules, made from tens to thousands of smaller molecules called amino acids, form things like hair, bones, muscles, enzymes for digestion, antibodies to fight diseases, and more. Proteins make these things by folding into various structures that in turn build up these larger tissues and biological components. And by knowing more about this folding process, researchers can better understand more about the processes that constitute life itself. Such knowledge is also essential to medicine, not only for the development of new treatments and industrial processes to produce medicines, but also for knowledge of how certain diseases work, as some are examples of protein folding gone wrong. So, to say proteins are important is putting it mildly. Proteins are the stuff of life.
Encouraged by the importance of protein folding, Project Assistant Professor Koji Ooka from the College of Arts and Sciences and Professor Munehito Arai from the Department of Life Sciences and Department of Physics embarked on the hard task of improving upon the prediction methods of protein folding. This task is formidable for many reasons. In particular, the computational requirements to simulate the dynamics of molecules necessitate a powerful supercomputer. Recently, the artificial intelligence-based program AlphaFold 2 accurately predicts structures resulting from a given amino acid sequence; but it cannot give details of the way proteins fold, making it a black box. This is problematic, as the forms and behaviors of proteins vary such that two similar ones may fold in radically different ways. So, instead of AI, the duo needed a different approach: statistical mechanics, a branch of physical theory.
“For over 20 years, a theory called the Wako-Saitô-Muñoz-Eaton (WSME) model has successfully predicted the folding processes for proteins comprising around 100 amino acids or fewer, based on the native protein structures,” said Arai. “WSME can only evaluate small sections of proteins at a time, missing potential connections between sections farther apart. To overcome this issue, we produced a new model, WSME-L, where the L stands for ‘linker.’ Our linkers correspond to these nonlocal interactions and allow WSME-L to elucidate the folding process without the limitations of protein size and shape, which AlphaFold 2 cannot.”
But it doesn’t end there. There are other limitations of existing protein folding models that Ooka and Arai set their sights on. Proteins can exist inside or outside of living cells; those within are in some ways protected by the cell, but those outside cells, such as antibodies, require additional bonds during folding, called disulfide bonds, which help to stabilize them. Conventional models cannot factor in these bonds, but an extension to WSME-L called WSME-L(SS), where each S stands for sulfide, can. To further complicate things, some proteins have disulfide bonds before folding starts, so the researchers made a further enhancement called WSME-L(SSintact), which factors in that situation at the expense of extra computation time.
“Our theory allows us to draw a kind of map of protein folding pathways in a relatively short time; mere seconds on a desktop computer for short proteins, and about an hour on a supercomputer for large proteins, assuming the native protein structure is available by experiments or AlphaFold 2 prediction,” said Arai. “The resulting landscape allows a comprehensive understanding of multiple potential folding pathways a long protein might take. And crucially, we can scrutinize structures of transient states. This might be helpful for those researching diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s — both are caused by proteins which fail to fold correctly. Also, our method may be useful for designing novel proteins and enzymes which can efficiently fold into stable functional structures, for medical and industrial use.”
While the models produced here accurately reflect experimental observations, Ooka and Arai hope they can be used to elucidate the folding processes of many proteins that have not yet been studied experimentally. Humans have about 20,000 different proteins, but only around 100 have had their folding processes thoroughly studied.

Dark matter halos measured around ancient quasars,"To ensure we keep this website safe, please can you confirm you are a human by ticking the box below. If you are unable to complete the above request please contact us using the below link, providing a screenshot of your experience. https://ioppublishing.org/contacts/","At the center of every galaxy is a supermassive black hole. Beyond a certain size, these become active, emitting huge amounts of radiation, and are then called quasars. It is thought these are activated by the presence of massive dark matter halos (DMH) surrounding the galaxy, directing matter towards the center, feeding the black hole. A team including researchers from the University of Tokyo have, for the first time, surveyed hundreds of ancient quasars and found this behavior is very consistent throughout history. This is surprising, as many large-scale processes show variation throughout the life of the universe, so the mechanism of quasar activation could have implications for the evolution of the entire universe.
Measuring the mass of DMHs is not easy; it’s famously a very elusive substance, if substance is even the right word to use, given the actual nature of dark matter is unknown. We only know it exists at all due to its gravitational impact on large structures such as galaxies. Thus, dark matter can only be measured by making observations about its gravitational effects on things. This includes the way it might pull on something or affect its movement, or through the lensing (bending of light) of objects behind a suspected area of dark matter.
The challenge becomes greater at large distances, given how weak the light from more distant, and therefore ancient, phenomena can be. But this did not stop Professor Nobunari Kashikawa from the Department of Astronomy, and his team, from trying to answer a long-standing question in astronomy: How are black holes born, and how do they grow? The researchers are especially keen to explore this in relation to supermassive black holes, the largest kind, which exist in the heart of every galaxy. These would be very difficult to study were it not for the fact that some grow so massive they begin to output incredibly powerful jets of matter or spheres of radiation that in either case become what we call quasars. These are so powerful that even at large distances, we can now observe them using modern techniques.
“We measured for the first time the typical mass for dark matter halos surrounding an active black hole in the universe about 13 billion years ago,” said Kashikawa. “We find the DMH mass of quasars is pretty constant at about 10 trillion times the mass of our sun. Such measurements have been made for more recent DMH around quasars, and those measurements are strikingly similar to what we see for more ancient quasars. This is interesting because it suggests there is a characteristic DMH mass which seems to activate a quasar, regardless of whether it happened billions of years ago or right now.”
Quasars at great distances appear faint, as the light which left them long ago has spread out, was absorbed by intervening matter, and has been stretched into nearly invisible infrared wavelengths due to the universe expanding over time. So Kashikawa and his team, whose project began in 2016, used multiple surveys of the sky which incorporated a range of different instruments, the main one being Japan’s Subaru Telescope, located in U.S. state of Hawaii.
“Upgrades allowed Subaru to see farther than ever, but we can learn more by expanding observation projects internationally,” said Kashikawa. “The U.S.-based Vera C. Rubin Observatory and even the space-based Euclid satellite, launched by the EU this year, will scan a larger area of the sky and find more DMH around quasars. We can build a more complete picture of the relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes. That might help inform our theories about how black holes form and grow.”

Advertisement Nature Communicationsvolume14, Article number:5288(2023)Cite this article 12kAccesses 179Altmetric Metricsdetails Plant-associated fungi show diverse lifestyles from pathogenic to mutualistic to the host; however, the principles and mechanisms through which they shift the lifestyles require elucidation. The root fungusColletotrichum tofieldiae(Ct) promotesArabidopsis thalianagrowth under phosphate limiting conditions. Here we describe a Ct strain, designated Ct3, that severely inhibits plant growth. Ct3 pathogenesis occurs through activation of host abscisic acid pathways via a fungal secondary metabolism gene cluster related to the biosynthesis of sesquiterpene metabolites, including botrydial. Cluster activation during root infection suppresses host nutrient uptake-related genes and changes mineral contents, suggesting a role in manipulating host nutrition state. Conversely, disruption or environmental suppression of the cluster renders Ct3 beneficial for plant growth, in a manner dependent on host phosphate starvation response regulators. Our findings indicate that a fungal metabolism cluster provides a means by which infectious fungi modulate lifestyles along the parasitic–mutualistic continuum in fluctuating environments. Plants associate intimately with diverse microbes, including pathogens, nonpathogenic commensals, and beneficial (mutualistic) microbes that promote plant growth. Plant–microbe interactions are typically context-dependent, as these microbes dynamically change their infection modes according to the environment and host conditions1,2. One microbe can switch between pathogenic and beneficial infection modes even in the same host, depending on the host and environmental conditions, without changing the microbial genomic sequences3,4. These findings imply that different lifestyles of plant-associated microbes are continuous within the same plant species and even coexist within the plant individual. Moreover, these microbes possess the capacity to refine infection strategies according to the given host environments5,6. However, the mechanisms by which infectious microbes transit between their contrasting lifestyles remain elusive. Plants have evolved an elaborate system called phosphate starvation response (PSR) to cope with low inorganic phosphate (Pi) conditions7. Under low Pi,A. thalianaplants induce extensive transcriptome reprogramming, mainly through the R2R3-MYB family transcription factorsPHOSPHATE RESPONSE1(AtPHR1) and relatedPHR1-LIKE1(AtPHL1)8,9. Plant adaptation to Pi deficit involves the activation of genes that promote phosphate absorption, allocation, and usage.A. thalianaplants also accommodate beneficial root-associated endophytic fungusColletotrichum tofieldiae(Ct) that helps nutrient acquisition. Their hyphae acquire and transfer phosphorus to the host, providing an extension of the plant root system3.AtPHR1andAtPHL1positively regulate phosphate transporter genes during Ct colonization and are required for Ct-mediated plant growth promotion under low Pi3.AtPHR1/AtPHL1restricts fungal overgrowth and potential virulence during beneficial interactions with Ct3, whereas negatively regulating plant immunity against bacteria10,11. However, our knowledge on the mechanisms by whichAtPHR1/AtPHL1play varied roles in different plant-microbe associations or host PSR influences microbial lifestyles is limited. Microbes have evolved an enormous repository of secondary metabolites, including plant hormone mimics for auxin and gibberellic and abscisic acid (ABA). Whereas more than half of the genes are organized in operons in bacteria, functionally related genes are typically distributed across the genome in eukaryotic fungi12. However, fungal secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes, as well as their regulatory genes, are often clustered in genetic loci13,14. The necrotrophic fungal pathogen,Botrytis cinerea, harbors a cluster of biosynthetic genes for ABA and produces ABA in culture15,16,17. There is a good correlation between the fungal ABA production and the host ABA signaling activation duringB. cinereainfection, which facilitates the suppression of immune-related genes inA. thaliana18,19. However, the expression patterns of fungal ABA biosynthesis genes during plant infection remain elusive. The possible significance also remains to be explored for these ABA and/or other secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes in the activation of host ABA pathways and fungal virulence. Furthermore, these secondary metabolism genes are often not expressed even during host interactions in conventional laboratory settings20,21. Consistently, disruptions of individual genes in secondary metabolism clusters typically do not alter fungal phenotypesin-planta22. These limitations have hampered the precise determination of the roles of secondary metabolism clusters in plant-infecting fungi. In the present study, we describe a pathogenic strain, Ct3, causing severe plant growth inhibition, in contrast to beneficial strains prevailing in Ct. Comparative genomics and functional analyses between these Ct strains indicate that, following root colonization, Ct3 displays transcriptional activation of biosynthesis gene clusters, putatively for ABA and the associated sesquiterpene metabolite botrydial (designated ABA-BOT), thereby promoting root infection and pathogenesis. Conversely, Ct3 colonization gives the host benefits when this fungal cluster is genetically disrupted or transcriptionally suppressed at mildly elevated temperatures in a manner dependent onAtPHR1/AtPHL1. These findings highlight the key role of fungal secondary metabolites in the infection-mode transition of plant-associated fungi. A Ct strain, Ct61, isolated from a wildA. thalianapopulation in Spain, promotes plant growth under low Pi conditions by transferring phosphorus to the host3. In addition to Ct61, five different Ct strains have been isolated from various plant species and geographical locations (Supplementary Table1)23,24. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using six molecular markers conventionally utilized for the identification ofColletotrichumspecies21,23,24,25,26is consistent with the view that the tested six Ct strains belong to the same species (Supplementary Fig.1). Notably, however, these five strains exhibited different growth morphology during in vitro growth (Fig.1aand Supplementary Fig.2a). aGrowth of Ct strains identified from various geographical locations in Mathur’s nutrient media after 3 days of incubation.

This prompted us to investigate the possible intraspecies variations of Ct in plant infection effects and strategies. We compared six Ct strains in their inoculation effects onA. thalianaCol-0 under gnotobiotic low Pi conditions (50 μM KH2PO4). Five of the tested Ct strains, including Ct61, significantly promoted plant growth, indicated by primary root length and shoot fresh weight (Fig.1b, cand Supplementary Fig.2b, c). The results suggest that plant growth-promoting (PGP) function under low Pi, at least discernible inA. thaliana, is extensively shared by Ct strains from various host and geographical niches. Notably, in contrast to these PGP strains, Ct3 severely inhibited shoot growth under low Pi (Fig.1b, cand Supplementary Fig.2b, c). Ct3 inhibited plant growth in additional 15A. thalianaaccessions (Supplementary Fig.2d) and also inBrassica rapavar.perviridis(Supplementary Fig.2f, Left), whose growth was promoted by beneficial Ct4 (Supplementary Fig.2f, Right), on unsterilized low nutrient soil. These results suggest that Ct3 pathogenic lifestyle is common in a broad diversity of Brassicaceae species, at least under the tested conditions. Since Ct61 PGP function is specific to low Pi3, we tested whether phosphate availability influences Ct3 and Ct4 infection phenotypes. Under normal Pi conditions (625 µM), Ct3 caused plant growth inhibition and leaf chlorosis (Fig.1dand Supplementary Fig.2c, g), whereas Ct4 did not cause plant growth inhibition or leaf chlorosis (Fig.1c, d). Under low Pi, Ct3 compromised plant growth but did not cause leaf chlorosis or reduce leaf chlorophyll contents (Fig.1c, d; Supplementary Fig.2c, g). In contrast to Ct3, Ct4 promoted plant growth (Fig.1d). Since sucrose increased and accelerated Ct3 growth but not Ct4 growth in culture (Supplementary Fig.2h), we hypothesize that Ct3 pathogenesis is dependent on host photosynthate supply and is alleviated when its supply is likely reduced under phosphate deficiency. To trace fungal colonization dynamics, we generated transgenic fungal strains expressing cytoplasmic GFP (Ct3-GFP or Ct4-GFP) under constitutiveGPDAregulatory DNA sequences3. Conidia of the transgenic Ct strains were then inoculated ontoA. thalianaroots, expressing an aquaporin PIP2A fused with mCherry, a plasma membrane/ER marker in living host cells3. Up to 5 days post-inoculation (dpi), both Ct3 and Ct4 hyphae both reached the cortex cell layer in the root (Fig.1e, f, Supplementary Movie1, Supplementary Movie2). The intracellular hyphae of Ct3 and Ct4 were weakly labeled with the mCherry-expressing plant plasma membrane, indicating that these Ct strains colonize inside the roots ofA. thaliana, as previously described for Ct613. The results indicate that Ct3 and Ct4 are either pathogenic or beneficial fungi colonizingA. thaliana, respectively, under the tested conditions. To grasp the genomic basis for the intraspecies variations between pathogenic Ct3 and beneficial Ct4, we determined their whole-genome sequences using a long-read generating PacBio sequencing platform. PacBio long reads provided high-quality genome assemblies for all strains, ranging from 53 to 55 Mb, with similar gene numbers for candidate effector proteins, carbohydrate-active enzymes, and secondary metabolism clusters (Supplementary Table2). Whole-genome alignment between Ct3 and Ct4 showed a high degree (Median: >98.6%) of nucleotide identity between the two genomes, despite their contrast infection strategies. In contrast, a comparison between the beneficial strains Ct61 and Ct4 showed numerous genomic rearrangements and a lesser degree of nucleotide identity (88.9%), implying a genome-wide divergence between Ct61 and Ct4, despite their similarities in host benefits (Fig.2a). These results suggest that nucleotide identity scores largely reflect the geographical distances of their origins. However, a molecular phylogenetic analysis using the conserved 1509 single-copy genes among the tested 71 fungal species suggests that beneficial Ct strains have evolved from their pathogenic relatives, such asC. incanum(Fig.2b; Supplementary Data1). It seems likely that beneficial lifestyles have evolved in pathogenic ancestors of Ct species. aSyntenies of Ct3, Ct4, and Ct61 genomes. The length of each contig was described as 0.8 Mb/scale. The percentage in the figure represents the median % of the nucleotide similarity against the whole locally collinear block (LCB). Pairwise genome comparisons point to the highest similarity between Ct3 and Ct4 and the lowest between Ct61 and Ct3.bMaximum-likelihood phylogenomic tree generated from a concatenated alignment of 1509 single-copy orthologous protein sequences from 70Colletotrichumstrains using IQ-TREE. Ultrafast bootstrap values (1000 replicates) are shown on the branches.B. cinereaB5.10 was used as an outgroup. The lifestyles of someColletotrichumfungi inA. thalianaroots under low Pi were investigated and are described in the tree (beneficial or pathogenic). We next investigated plant responses following root inoculation with beneficial and pathogenic Ct strains via RNA-seq analysis at two-time points, 10 dpi and 24 dpi (Fig.3a). At 10 dpi, Ct3 caused plant growth inhibition under both normal and low Pi conditions, whereas PGP effects of beneficial Ct strains were not yet apparent (Supplementary Fig.3a). At 24 dpi, the degree of plant growth inhibition by Ct3 was lowered under Pi deficiency compared with Pi sufficiency (Supplementary Fig.3b), whereas PGP by beneficial Ct61 and Ct4 became discernible only under Pi deficiency (Fig.1band Supplementary Fig.3b). In contrast to these Ct strains, the KHC strain (previously classified asC. tofieldiae), closely related toC. higginsianum(Fig.2band Supplementary Fig.1), did not alter plant growth under low Pi condition (Fig.3aand Supplementary Fig.3b), displaying a nonpathogenic lifestyle. aExperimental setup for dual RNA-seq analysis ofA. thalianaand Ct transcriptomes.bMultidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis chart generated from plant transcriptome profile during association with the indicated Ct and KHC strains under normal (P) and low Pi (m) conditions, with three biological replicates.cExpression patterns ofA. thalianagenes differentially expressed during pathogenic Ct3 association compared with beneficial Ct associations (( | log2FC | >1, FDR < 0.05), indicated by cluster analysis divided by kmean (K= 3, PAM clustering with Jensen-Shannon distance).

We first focused on the divergence in plant responses between these Ct strains at 10 dpi, when Ct3 already caused plant growth inhibition (Supplementary Fig.3a). Multidimensional scaling analysis indicated a clear separation of plant transcriptome in response to Ct3 compared to beneficial Ct and nonpathogenic KHC strains, suggesting distinct plant responses to Ct3 at this stage (Fig.3b). The results revealed 758A. thalianagenes that were differentially upregulated in Ct3-infected roots compared with beneficial Ct strains, under normal or low Pi conditions (log2FC\( > \)1, FDR\( < \)0.05, Supplementary Data2).K-means clustering classified these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) into three different clusters (Fig.3cand Supplementary Data3). In Clusters 1 and 2, Gene Ontology (GO) categories related to ABA signaling were overrepresented (Fig.3cand Supplementary Data3), suggesting that Ct3 specifically induces host ABA responses. ABA promotes plant adaptation to water deficit27and influences immunity or susceptibility-related pathways28. qRT-PCR analyses validated the increased expression of ABA-responsive plant genes,AtRD29A29andAtMAPKKK1830, during pathogenic Ct3 infection (Fig.3d, e). ABA accumulation also increased in roots following Ct3, but not Ct4, colonization (Fig.3f). The results indicate that Ct3, but not Ct4, strongly induces ABA responses in roots. We then tested whether and how host ABA contributes to Ct3-mediated plant growth inhibition, with plant mutants disrupted in ABA signaling,abi1-1C; ABA biosynthesis,aba1andaba2-12; and ABA perception,pyr1-1 pyl1 pyl2 pyl4 pyl5. Ct3-mediated plant growth inhibition was alleviated in these ABA-defective mutants under low Pi (Fig.3g). In contrast, plant growth promotion via beneficial Ct4 under low Pi was not affected inabi1-1C(Supplementary Fig.3c). These analyses suggest that pathogenic but not beneficial lifestyles of Ct3 are dependent on the core ABA biosynthetic and response pathways of the host. During beneficial interactions under low Pi, Ct61 induced a subset of PSR-related genes in plants, including phosphate transporterAtPHTgenes, at 24 dpi3. Since PSR-related transcriptional reprogramming largely relies onAtPHR1andAtPHL19, we next assessed the possible impact of beneficial Ct strains onAtPHR1/AtPHL1-regulated PSR-related genes under low Pi at 24 dpi when PGP by beneficial Ct61 and Ct4 became discernible. Cross-referencing our data with previously described 193AtPHR1/AtPHL1regulons9indicated increased expression for approximately half of them [88 of 193 genes (Ct61), or 99 of 193 genes (Ct4), FDR < 0.05] during beneficial Ct interactions compared with the mock controls, specifically under low Pi (Supplementary Fig.3d). In contrast, PSR gene activation was not increased during pathogenic or nonpathogenic interaction with Ct3 or KHC, respectively, at 24 dpi (Supplementary Fig.3d). At 10 dpi, however, Ct3 strongly upregulated a subset of PSR-related genes under low Pi compared with the mock controls (Supplementary Fig.3e, 146 of 193 genes, FDR < 0.05), indicated by the induction of Clusters 2 and 3 genes related to PSRs, in which GOs overrepresented “Cellular response to starvation (Cluster 2)” and “cellular response to phosphate starvation (Cluster 3)” (Fig.3cand Supplementary Data3). Upregulation of PSR genes was associated with an increase in shoot P concentrations following Ct3 inoculation under low Pi (Supplementary Fig.3f), coincident with alleviated pathogenesis. Notably, Ct3 inoculation upregulated a subset ofAtPHR1/AtPHL1regulons, which were otherwise not induced, under Pi sufficient conditions (Fig.3c(Cluster 3) and Supplementary Fig.3e, 69 of 193 genes, FDR < 0.05). The results suggested that Ct3 infection results inAtPHR1/AtPHL1regulon activation, at least during an early infection phase, despite the eventual negative effects on plant growth. We then examined howAtPHR1/AtPHL1-dependent PSR influences pathogenic Ct3 lifestyles by testing for Ct3 inoculation phenotypes inphr1 phl1plants. Compared to WT,phr1 phl1displayed severe growth inhibition following Ct3 inoculation under low Pi (Supplementary Fig.3g). The results indicate a critical role forAtPHR1/AtPHL1in the alleviation of plant growth inhibition under low Pi. Together with the transcriptome analyses above (Supplementary Fig.3), we infer from the results that activation ofAtPHR1/AtPHL1regulons serves to restrict Ct3 pathogenesis. To assess the basis for transcriptional activation of host ABA responses, we examined fungal transcriptome profiles during pathogenic Ct3 infection (Supplementary Data4). As Ct3-mediated ABA response activation and plant growth inhibition were pronounced at 10 dpi (Fig.3cand Supplementary Fig.2g), we assembled Ct3 genes that were differentially upregulated at 10 dpi compared to 24 dpi. This resulted in 304 fungal genes upregulated in an early phase under normal or low Pi conditions (Fig.4a, log2FC > 1, FDR < 0.05). The number of these genes was greater under normal Pi than low Pi (Fig.4a), consistent with enhanced Ct3 impacts on plant growth under normal Pi (Fig.1). aVenn diagram showing Ct3 genes differentially upregulated in early colonization (10 dpi) compared with late colonization (24 dpi) phases ( | log2FC | >1, FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Data4).

All four genera carrying putative ABA and BOT gene clusters in their genomes were used for comparison. Organisms harboring adjacent putative ABA and BOT clusters (ABA + BOT (ABA-BOT) clusters) in their genomes are labeled with gray backgrounds. Phylogenetic analyses of these genes in the clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig.4b–l. Interestingly, 92 among 304 Ct3 genes were only expressed at 10 dpi under both Pi conditions, but their expression was below detectable levels at 24 dpi, coincident with fungal pathogenesis that was pronounced at 10 dpi (Supplementary Data5). We noticed that putative ABA biosynthesis genes (Ct3ABA1,Ct3ABA2, andCt3ABA3) were included in the 92 pathogenesis-associated genes. They show high sequence similarity to ABA biosynthesis genes (BcABA1-BcABA3) inB. cinerea(Supplementary Data4).BcABA1andBcABA2encode cytochrome P450, andBcABA3encodes sesquiterpene synthase catalyzing the initial step from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), in a fungal ABA biosynthesis pathway that is entirely different from that of plants16,17,31. Interestingly, in Ct3, these putative ABA biosynthesis genes are clustered together with those highly related to the biosynthesis of botrydial (BOT), an ABA-related sesquiterpene metabolite inB. cinerea(Fig.4b, Supplementary Table3)32,33. Five BOT biosynthesis genes (namedBOT1-BOT5) were co-activated with the three putative ABA biosynthesis genes during root colonization in Ct3 but not in other beneficial Ct strains (Fig.4c, Supplementary Table4), despite the high conservation of their cluster across these Ct genomes. Their encoded amino acid sequences were nearly identical (particularly in Ct4; Supplementary Fig.4o: see below). These genes were silenced at 24 dpi when plant growth inhibited by Ct3 was alleviated (Supplementary Fig.2g; Supplementary Table4). Furthermore, pathogenicC. incanumdisplayed an upregulation ofCiABA3andCiBOT5during root infection (Supplementary Fig.4a). Therefore, co-activation of putative ABA and BOT biosynthesis genes was specifically associated with pathogenic lifestyles in the root-infectingColletotrichumspecies. Our comparative genomic analysis indicated that putative ABA and BOT biosynthesis genes are conserved as a single cluster in beneficial and pathogenic Ct genomes but are separate in theB. cinereagenome (Fig.4b). Furthermore, these genes, in particular of the BOT cluster genes, show very high degrees of sequence conservation betweenColletotrichumspp. (class Sordariomycetes) andB. cinerea(class Leotiomycetes). Such sequence conservation was unexpected, given the considerable phylogenetic distance between the two fungal lineages, which diverged approximately 261.6 million years ago21. To assess the evolutionary origin(s) of putative ABA and BOT biosynthesis genes, we generated molecular phylogenetic trees for these genes from theColletotrichumstrains (Ct3, Ct4, C. liriopes,C. spaethianum34, belonging to thespaethianumclade), and from the GenBank non-redundant protein sequences (NR) database (Fig.4d, Supplementary Data6and7). Phylogenetic analyses showed (1) that putative ABA and BOT cluster genes were distributed across distantly related plant-associated fungi in a manner different from their phylogenic relationships (Supplementary Fig.4b–m), (2) that putative ABA and BOT cluster genes each formed monophyletic groups (Supplementary Fig.4b–m), (3) that genes in the putative ABA or BOT cluster each have similar evolutionary histories (Supplementary Fig.4b–m), but (4) that the putative ABA and BOT clusters have different evolutionary histories, indicated by their divergence in molecular phylogenetic trees (Fig.4dand Supplementary Fig.4b–m). The substantial differences between species and gene trees suggest horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) distributing the putative ABA and BOT biosynthesis gene clusters among these plant-associated fungi. Our comparative genomic analysis revealed thatDiaporthe helianthi, a plant pathogen, also possesses a single putative ABA-BOT biosynthesis gene cluster of high synteny when compared with Ct (Supplementary Fig.4n). On an assumption that the putative ABA-BOT cluster originated only once according to the principle of parsimony, the results suggest a HGT of the BOT cluster toBotrytis, (Fig.4dand Supplementary Fig.4m, n). Given that the putative ABA and BOT clusters have likely arisen multiple times in different phytopathogenic fungi, it is conceivable that the acquisition of putative ABA and BOT biosynthesis gene cluster(s) contributes to pathogenesis evolution in plant-associated fungi. Gene composition in putative ABA and BOT biosynthesis clusters was slightly different across species. The putative ABA biosynthesis cluster consists ofABA1-ABA3in, e.g., Ct,C. incanum, andD. helianthiorABA1-ABA4in, e.g.,B. cinerea(Fig.4d, Supplementary Fig.4b–e, and4m, n).CtABA4was separately located in Ct genomes (Fig.4b), and unlikeCt3ABA1-Ct3ABA3, its expression was not detected in Ct3 during root colonization (Supplementary Table4), suggesting thatCt3ABA4is dispensable for Ct3 root colonization or pathogenesis in Ct3. The BOT gene cluster typically consists ofBOT1-BOT7, whereBOT6andBOT7correspond to Zn_clus (Zn2Cys6transcription factor) and Adh_short (retinol dehydrogenase 8) genes, respectively, named inB. cinerea33.BOT6andBOT7show similar phylogenetic distributions with the other five BOT genes withinColletotrichumandBotrytisstrains, indicating functional coupling of these genes in these fungal lineages (Supplementary Fig.4f–n). We confirmed thatCt3BOT6andCt3BOT7were strongly expressed during Ct3 pathogenesis (Supplementary Table4). Our phylogenetic analyses revealed a previously unsuspected diversity in the repertories of biosynthetic genes for putative ABA and BOT among plant-associated fungi. We examined whether the biosynthetic genes in Ct3 mediate the production of these metabolites as predicted, like inB. cinerea. We generated fungal knockout mutants forCt3ABA2,Ct3ABA3, andCt3BOT5via homologous recombination. We then profiled metabolites related to BOT biosynthesis in the WT, Ct3Δaba2, Ct3Δaba3, and Ct3Δbot5strains when cultivated in three distinct nutrient media (Mathurs, MPY, rice-based media). This detected two previously reported intermediate metabolites in BOT biosynthesis, 4β-acetoxyprobotryan-9β-ol (9) and 4β-acetoxyprobotryane-9β,15α-diol (10)35,36, previously reported inB. cinereain Ct3 (Fig.5; Supplementary Fig.5), specifically when cultivated in rice-based media (Fig.5). Importantly, the accumulation of these metabolites was abolished in Ct3Δbot5, disrupted at a putative catalyzing step upstream of their production, whereas it was unaffected in Ct3Δaba(Fig.5). The results indicate that theCt3BOTcontributes to the biosynthesis of BOT (6). In contrast, ABA (S1) or related precursor metabolites (S3, S5) were not detected under the conditions tested (Supplementary Fig.6), implying a separation between ABA and BOT gene functioning, despite their co-clustering in the fungal genome and transcriptional co-regulation during root colonization. Alternatively, this may imply that the gene cluster is involved in the production of a metabolite or metabolites other than ABA. GC–MS profiles for 9 and 10 were obtained in the indicated Ct3 genotypes under the indicated medium conditions. We next tested whether putative fungal ABA and BOT biosynthesis genes are required for Ct3 pathogenesis. Ct3Δaba2, Ct3Δaba3, Ct3Δbot1, Ct3Δbot3, and Ct3Δbot5mutant fungi showed WT-like growth and spore formation on nutrient-rich media and WT-like hyphal growth on glass slides (Supplementary Fig.7a–c). Ct3Δaba2, Ct3Δaba3, and Ct3Δbot5fungi showed WT-like growth on normal or low Pi media under our conditions (Fig.6a), suggesting that these genes are dispensable for culture growth in Ct3. aFungal colony diameter under normal Pi and low Pi conditions.

Representative plant photos are shown (Bar = 1 cm). We next examined a possible role for these fungal genes in the induction of host ABA responses after root inoculation. Compared to WT fungi, ABA-dependentAtMAPKKK18induction was reduced in the roots inoculated with Ct3Δaba2and Ct3Δaba3fungi, suggesting that the fungal ABA biosynthesis genes are required for the host ABA responses (Fig.6b). Interestingly,AtMAPKKK18induction was also absent in the roots inoculated with Ct3Δbotfungi (Fig.6b), suggesting a role forCt3BOTgenes in activating plant ABA responses. Furthermore, root fungal biomass was dramatically reduced for Ct3Δabaand Ct3Δbotfungi compared with WT fungi (Fig.6cand Supplementary Fig.7d-e). indicating that these fungal genes contribute to root infection of Ct3. Since Ct3 but not Ct4 increases fungal growth in the presence of sucrose (Supplementary Fig.2h), we tested whether Ct3 root infection influences sucrose accumulation in the host. Ct3 colonization resulted in the accumulation of sucrose in roots, which was found to be dependent on theCt3ABA2andCt3BOT5genes (Supplementary Fig.7f). These observations suggest that activation of the putative ABA-BOT cluster promotes sugar accumulation, which may turn, be exploited by Ct3 for extensive fungal growth in roots. Plant growth inhibition was also reduced when inoculated with Ct3Δaba2and Ct3Δaba3fungi compared with WT fungi (Fig.6dand Supplementary Fig.7g, h). Ct3 virulence was, however, restored when ABA was exogenously applied (Supplementary Fig.7i).Ct3ABA3-mediated plant growth inhibition was reduced in the host mutants defective in ABA signaling or biosynthesis (Fig.6d). The results suggest that biosynthesis of ABA by Ct3 requires the plant ABA core pathway to promote fungal pathogenesis. Notably, exogenous ABA application also suppressed both plant growth and Ct4-mediated PGP under low Pi conditions (Supplementary Fig.7j). The results are consistent with fungal-derived ABA playing a role in shifting from a beneficial to a pathogenic lifestyle in Ct. Remarkably, Ct3Δbot5fungi did not inhibit but rather promoted plant growth under low Pi, reminiscent of Ct4 (Fig.6eand Supplementary Fig.7k). The mutation effects were abolished whenCt3BOT5was introduced back into the Ct3Δbot5(Supplementary Fig.7l). The results suggest that BOT biosynthesis is required for Ct3 virulence, and its disruption even renders Ct3 beneficial for the host. We noticed that Ct3 inoculation promoted plant growth under low Pi at 26 °C (Fig.7a). This was accompanied by a decrease in fungal root colonization at 26 °C compared to 22 °C (Fig.7b). Plant growth promotion and fungal colonization at high temperatures were unaffected for Ct3Δaba3or Ct3Δbot5fungi (Fig.7a), consistent with a great decrease inCt3ABA3andCt3BOT5expression during root colonization at 26 °C (Fig.7c). Limitation of Ct3 root colonization at high temperatures was thus associated with low expression of the putative fungal ABA-BOT cluster genes. However, inphr1phl1plants, Ct3 inhibited plant growth even at 26 °C in a manner dependent on the putative ABA-BOT cluster (Fig.7a), suggesting that the suppression of fungal pathogenesis via the putative ABA-BOT at high temperatures requires the hostAtPHR1/AtPHL1. Consistently, Ct3Δaba3and Ct3Δbot5fungi both promoted plant growth even inphr1 phl1plants at 26 °C (Fig.7a). This also suggests thatAtPHR1/AtPHL1are not required for PGP per se at high temperatures when the putative fungal ABA-BOT cluster is disrupted. Non-inoculated WT andphr1 phl1plants were indistinguishable in shoot growth at 26 °C even under low Pi, at least in our settings (Fig.7a). These results indicate a critical role for the putative ABA–BOT cluster and its negative regulation by hostAtPHR1/AtPHL1, in the pathogen-mutualist transition of Ct3. aShoot fresh weight at 24 dpi with the indicated fungi at 26 °C under low Pi.

CtABA1, CtABA2, CtBOT1, CtBOT3, andCtBOT4, all annotated to encode P450, constitute a large monophyletic group (Fig.8aand Supplementary Fig.8a). The simultaneous expression of these genes in conjunction with other Ct3 genes, suggests their interdependent regulation. Initially, we examined whether the expression of the 92 Ct3 genes, which were co-expressed with putative ABA and BOT genes during pathogenesis, was altered in the Ct3Δaba2, Ct3Δaba3, and Ct3Δbot5mutant strains in comparison to the wild type (WT) (Supplementary Data8). Our findings indicate that the expression levels of these Ct3 genes remained largely unaffected in the mutant strains (Supplementary Data9), implying a separate regulation of putative ABA and BOT genes from the other genes. aMaximum Likelihood tree of ABA and BOT genes in Cytochrome P450 family using IQ-TREE version 1.6.11.

The median values are described within each boxplot. The fresh weight of each plant was measured after 24 days of incubation. Different letters indicate significantly different statistical groups (ANOVA, Tukey-HSD test,p< 0.05). The requirements of putative ABA and BOT genes for activating the plant core ABA pathway during Ct3 infection implied the existence of a common host target(s) for the two fungal biosynthesis pathways. To gain insight into the host pathways affected by the putative fungal ABA-BOT cluster, we next assembledA. thalianagenes specifically induced or repressed by pathogenic Ct3, but not beneficial Ct4, in a manner dependent on the putative Ct3 ABA-BOT cluster. We examined root transcriptome at 10 dpi with WT, Ct3Δaba2, Ct3Δaba3, and Ct3Δbot5of Ct3, and with WT Ct4 under low Pi, where theCt3ABA/Ct3BOTexpression status greatly influences Ct3 lifestyles (Supplementary Data10). Plant responses were similar among Ct3Δaba, Ct3Δbot, and Ct4 (Supplementary Fig.8b), consistent with their PGP effects under low Pi (Fig.6e). Plant DEGs following inoculation with WT Ct3, compared with Ct3Δaba2, Ct3Δaba3, and Ct3Δbot5mutants and WT Ct4, included 288 Ct3-induced genes and 375 Ct3-repressed genes (Fig.8b–cand Supplementary Data11and12). Ct3-induced genes were overrepresented with the genes responsive to oxidative stress, chitin, ABA, and cellular response to phosphate starvation. DNA motif analysis revealed DNA sequences bound by NAC transcription factors related to drought tolerance37being enriched within 1000 bp upstream of their transcription initiation sites (Supplementary Fig.8c). Notably, the RNA-seq analyses also indicated that PSR gene activation at 10 dpi with Ct3 was dependent on the putative fungal ABA-BOT cluster (Fig.8d). We further showed that expression ofAtAT4, an AtPHR1-regulon during PSR, was significantly lowered inabi1-1Candaba2plants when colonized with Ct3 (Supplementary Fig.8d), indicating a role for the host ABA pathway in Ct3 induction of host PSR genes. Interestingly, a large subset of GOs overrepresented in the 375 Ct3-repressed plant genes were related to hosting nutrition, such as inorganic anion transport, cation homeostasis, and inorganic ion homeostasis (Supplementary Data12and Fig.8c, e). Consistently, Ct3 root colonization changed host shoot nutrition status depending on putative ABA-BOT (Supplementary Fig.8e). The results suggest that Ct3 root infection suppresses host nutrient uptake and impacts host mineral homeostasis. To test the biological significance of this suppression, we examined whether the genes repressed byCt3ABAandCt3BOTgenes and by host ABA pathways under low Pi contribute to plant growth (Fig.8e). Ct3-repressible genes includedAtNRT1.1andAtNRT2.1, two major transporters for nitrate uptake38, andAtFIT, FER-like iron deficiency-induced transcription factor inducing Fe uptake genes39. Ct3 repression ofAtNRT1.1andAtNRT2.1expression was alleviated inaba2andabi1-1Cplants, respectively, pointing to its dependence on ABA (Supplementary Fig.8f, g). Disruption ofAtNRT1.1,AtNRT2.1, orAtFITresulted in strong growth deficits or chlorosis under normal Pi in the absence of Ct3, whereas their disruption did not show significant effects under low Pi (Fig.8fand Supplementary Fig.8h, i). Although this has hampered assessing Ct3 infection phenotypes in these mutant plants, the results suggest that these nutrition-related genes are rate-limiting in plant growth under Pi sufficiency and that they define a host target for the fungal ABA-BOT cluster during Ct3-mediated plant growth inhibition. In this study, we obtain evidence in a Ct strain (Ct3) that a dynamic transition from pathogenic to mutualistic lifestyles during the root colonization is achieved by altering the expression of a single fungal secondary metabolism cluster (putative ABA-BOT) (Fig.9). It has been well documented that the presence or absence of one genetic component(s) in the genome, e.g., an island, plasmid, or (mini) chromosome, is associated with the distinction between pathogenic and nonpathogenic (or potentially beneficial) lifestyles in different bacteria and fungi40,41,42. In contrast, our studies reveal that the beneficial and pathogenic Ct strains share a nearly identical putative ABA-BOT cluster in their genomes and that its expression status plays a critical role in the diversification of fungal lifestyles. Unlike beneficial Ct strains (Ct4 and Ct61), Ct3 induces putative ABA-BOT gene expression during an initial phase of root colonization. This putatively leads to fungal production of ABA, its precursors, and/or related metabolites from the ABA biosynthetic genes as summarized previously16and botrydial production from the BOT biosynthetic genes as shown in Fig.5. These metabolites, in turn, involve the host ABA core pathway, thereby leading to the suppression of nutrient uptake-related genes and the activation of PSR-related genes inA. thaliana. Perturbation of the host nutrition pathways is then associated with sucrose accumulation in the roots, which is likely to facilitate Ct3 hyphal growth. At 26 °C, Ct3 colonizes the roots with the putative ABA-BOT genes silenced through the host AtPHR1/AtPHL1 and promotes plant growth under low Pi. Our studies further indicate that altering Ct3 putative ABA-BOT cluster expression enables its lifestyle transition on the same host. The divergence between adapted and non-adapted (nonpathogenic) fungal pathogens was often attributed to transcriptional induction of virulence-related genes in the former43,44. Our findings extend this view that the loss of the putative ABA-BOT cluster not only results in the suppression of Ct3 pathogenesis but the expression of PGP function under low Pi, reminiscent of other beneficial Ct strains. This is also the case at high temperatures, where not only Ct3 virulence suppression but PGP is also achieved, likely through the hostAtPHR1/AtPHL1-dependent suppression of putative ABA-BOT cluster expression. The results highlight an important role played by a secondary metabolism gene cluster in the plastic lifestyle transition of plant-infecting fungi and the convergence of environmental and host modulations on its transcriptional regulation. Notably, the investigated Ct strains, albeit classified into the Ct species through the widely accepted method forColletotrichumspecies, harbor substantial genomic sequence variations. Although there are no sequence differences in the putative ABA-BOT region, there are subtle variations outside the putative ABA-BOT region between beneficial and pathogenic Ct strains, which might contribute to the divergence in the expression profiles of putative ABA-BOT genes and in fungal infection modes. Further studies are warranted to examine this hypothesis and the underlying mechanisms. How does the Ct3 putative ABA-BOT cluster inhibit plant growth? Under our conditions, Ct3 and Ct4 are largely indistinguishable in root colonization levels (Fig.1e–h, Fig.6c), making it unlikely that Ct3 pathogenesis is caused by fungal overgrowth in the roots. It has been described that bacterial and fungal pathogens mobilize the host ABA pathway to suppress plant immunity, in particular, salicylic acid (SA)-based defenses28. However, our transcriptomic analyses on Ct3 wild-type and Ct3Δaba/Ct3Δbotfungi did not detect ABA/BOT-dependent alterations in plant induction of defense-related genes. Consistently, beneficial Ct61 promotes plant growth in the plants simultaneously disrupted with defense-related hormones, SA, jasmonate, ethylene, and defense regulatorAtPAD4, as well as in the WT plants, without fungal overgrowth3. These data suggest that Ct3-mediated virulence is not expressed through ABA-SA antagonism. Rather, our transcriptome and genetic data suggest that Ct3 utilizes the putative ABA-BOT cluster to suppress the host genes required for the acquisition of different key nutrients, such as nitrogen, iron, and zinc, which are rate-limiting in plant growth, particularly when phosphate is sufficient. These results suggest that Ct3 virulence via putative ABA-BOT occurs at least in part through perturbation of host nutrition. Indeed, Ct3 putative ABA-BOT contributes to sucrose accumulation in the host roots (Supplementary Fig.7f), which is likely effectively exploited by the fungus for increasing hyphal growth. Host plants requireAtPHR1/AtPHL1for suppression of fungal overgrowth in beneficial interactions with Ct61, a prerequisite for PGP3. This work further shows the critical role ofAtPHR1/AtPHL1in restricting Ct3 pathogenesis. Consistently, PSR-relatedAtPHR1/AtPHL1regulons are induced during both pathogenic and beneficial interactions, albeit at different timings. In Ct3, putative ABA-BOT genes serve to accelerate the early induction of host PSR-related genes (at 10 dpi) even under Pi-sufficient conditions, likely through the host ABA core pathways. This may reflect a positive role for ABA in PSR under low Pi45,46. In contrast, beneficial Ct strains induce host PSR-related genes, specifically under low Pi, at a later phase (24 dpi), coincident with the appearance of PGP effects. Given the absence ofCtABA/CtBOTgene expression in beneficial Ct strains, their PSR activation seems independent of putative fungal ABA or BOT biosynthesis genes. Indeed, like Ct3, beneficial Ct strains efficiently colonizeA. thalianaroots under low Pi without expressingCtABA/CtBOTgenes (Figs.1e, f and6c). Therefore, separate fungal mechanisms, in terms of ABA dependence, are likely to confer host PSR activation between pathogenic Ct3 and beneficial Ct interactions. Conversely,AtPHR1/AtPHL1restricts fungal growth under low Pi through the suppression of separate fungal infection strategies between Ct3 and beneficial Ct strains, diverging in putative ABA-BOT dependence. Our evidence attributesAtPHR1/AtPHL1-mediated alleviation of Ct3 pathogenesis to the suppression of fungal putative ABA-BOT expression, under low Pi and at high temperatures. Plant transcriptome data not detecting differential defense gene regulation imply thatAtPHR1/AtPHL1-mediated control of fungal growth is also distinct from their suppression of pattern-triggered immunity10,11. Interestingly, the loss ofAtPHR1/AtPHL1allows Ct3Δaba3and Ct3Δbot5fungi to promote plant growth inphr1 phl1at elevated temperatures, which is not seen in the WT plants (Fig.7a). This indicates thatAtPHR1/AtPHL1are not required for the PGP per se conferred by Ct3 at high temperatures when the putative ABA-BOT cluster is disrupted. In addition to stimulating host ABA signaling, putative ABA-BOT may suppress the PGP function through promoting host Pi acquisition, which is conserved in Ct species, including Ct3 (suggested by Fig.7a). This also seems to apply to pathogenicC. incanum, in which inherent putative ABA-BOT expression is associated with a massive decrease in phosphorus transfer to the host compared to beneficial Ct613. Notably, however, in Ct3, this PGP function is likely suppressed byAtPHR1/AtPHL1, suggested by the absence of PGP in WT plants when inoculated with Ct3Δaba3/Ct3Δbot5fungi (Fig.7a). It is conceivable that ABA-dependent activation ofAtPHR1/AtPHL1regulons activated at 10 dpi with Ct3 contributes to the suppression of PGP, given the previously described negative role forAtPHR1in nitrate transporter expression, includingAtNRT1.1, required for plant growth47,48. The mechanisms underlying the multifaceted functions ofAtPHR1/AtPHL1in the complex host–fungus interactions require further studies. Consistent with our molecular phylogenetic analysis that the beneficial strains are derived from the pathogenic ancestors (e.g.,C. incanumorC. liriopes), the present evidence indicates that the acquisition and expression of putative ABA-BOT gene cluster (or putative ABA and BOT gene clusters) contribute to fungal pathogenesis, likely through the activation of host ABA biosynthesis and signaling during infection. It seems that putative ABA and BOT gene clusters also contribute to fungal pathogenesis inBotrytis, as shown for Ct since host ABA signaling is required for the infection and pathogenesis of the necrotrophic fungus18,19. Although definite proof remains to be obtained, putative ABA-BOT gene clusters are likely to confer virulence in phylogenetically diverse fungi beyond Ct species. The additional requirements for host ABA biosynthesis in fungal pathogenesis imply that these fungal genes alone are not sufficient for effective ABA biosynthesis and virulence. Future studies will be required to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which fungal and plant ABA pathways work in concert to promote fungal virulence. Arabidopsis thalianaCol-0, theabi1-1C27,aba149,aba2-1250,pyr1-1 pyl1 pyl2 pyl4 pyl551,phf152,phr1 phl19,nrt1.1 (chl1-553),nrt2.1nrt2.254, andfit1-239mutants (Col-0 background) andnrt1.1_2(Ler background) were used in this study. We also used 15A. thalianaWT accessions as described in Supplementary Fig.2. Seeds were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for the 30 s, followed by 6% sodium hypochlorite with 0.01% Triton X. After being washed three times in sterilized water, seeds were placed in cold treatment at 4 °C for 24 h before sowing. SterilizedA. thalianaseeds were sowed on half-strength MS agarose medium containing defined Pi concentrations. Ct spores (3 μL of 1 × 104/ml) were inoculated 3 cm below the sowed seeds. Plates were placed vertically in a plant growth chamber under a 10:12 h light: dark cycle at ~22 °C ( ± 1 °C) (80 μmol/m2s) around 50% humidity unless otherwise described. For 26 °C assays, plants were incubated in a plant growth chamber under a 10:12 h light: dark cycle at ~26 °C (80 μmol/m2s) during light and ~22 °C during dark. Effects on plant growth by fungal inoculation were evaluated by measuring shoot fresh weight, root length, or chlorophyll a and b from ~15 plants per experiment. Ct hyphae were mixed with soils for soil inoculation, andB. rapaseeds were incubated for 24 days on the soils before measuring shoot fresh weight (SFW). Half-strength MS medium used in this study is based on the previous work55, with minor modifications. Agar granulated (Difco) was initially used as an agar containing limited phosphate in this study. However, as the new batches of the agars caused unstable growth in mock-treated plants under low Pi, INA Agar BA-10 (INA food) with further limited phosphate was used as an alternative. pH was adjusted to 5.1. 55 ml of the mixture was then poured into square Petri plates (15 × 15 cm, Greiner). For Ct inoculation in soils, Ct spores (50 mL of 1 × 104/ml) or distilled water (mock treatment) were incubated on mixtures of autoclaved 180 g sawdust, 60 g rice bran, 60 g bran, and 180 ml water for 2 weeks, where mixtures with or without Ct hyphae were mixed with soils containing Kanuma soil, Exo sand, and black soil (15:42.5:42.5) with 3-5% weight. Before measuring SFW, B. rapavar.perviridisseeds (ʻMisakiʼ, Sakata seeds) were then sowed in the soil and incubated for 24 days. Agar plugs of ten-day-old fungal cultures grown on Mathur’s media were transferred to new Mathur’s plates. Alternatively, 3 µL of fungal spore suspension, comprising approximately 1 × 104/ml, was put onto standard Pi media (625 µM KH2PO4) and low Pi media (50 µM KH2PO4) without sucrose. Colony formation was determined three days after inoculation by measuring the colony radius from center to edge. Fungal spore counts were conducted as described previously56. For fungal growth on glass slides, fungal spores were placed on glass slides and incubated for 3 days. The method of chlorophyll quantification was adapted from the previous report57. Samples were prepared from ~100 mg of leaf tissue pooled from ~4 plants per sample and weighed. Chlorophyll was extracted by adding 800 µL chilled cold 100% acetone, and samples were shaken for 10 min until plant tissue was transparent. After the samples were diluted four times with 80% acetone, the absorbance of tissue-free chlorophyll extract was measured at 646 nm, 663 nm, and 750 nm with an Eppendorf Biospectrometer following the formula. A: Chlorophyll a (µg/ml) = 12.25 × (OD663.6− OD750) − 2.85 × (OD646.6− OD750) B: Chlorophyll b (µg/ml) = 20.31 × (OD646.6− OD750) − 4.91 × (OD663.6− OD750) cDNA was synthesized from 300 to 500 ng total RNA using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara) in a volume of 10 µL. We then amplified 3 µL of cDNA (10 ng/µL) in Power SYBR (Thermo) with 1.6 µM primers using the AriaMx real-time PCR system (Agilent) in a volume of 12 µL. Primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table5. For targeted gene replacement, we used the previously described method3. Briefly, to generate replacement mutants lacking Ct3 putative ABA biosynthesis genes (ABA2andABA3) or BOT biosynthesis genes (BOT1,BOT3, andBOT5), we constructed a plasmid in which the Hyg resistance gene cassette was inserted between DNA sequences flanking the target gene. Around 1.5-kb fragments of 5′ (5 F) and 3′ sequences (3 F) flanking the gene ORF were amplified from Ct3 genomic DNA by PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). The purified PCR products 5 F and 3 F were mixed withSalI-treated pBIG4MRHrev for In-Fusion reactions. This generated plasmid was then introduced intoAgrobacteriumC58C1 strains by electroporation using the default setting for the Eppendorf Eporator. The transformedAgrobacteriumstrains (OD600= 0.4) were mixed with Ct3 spores (1 × 107) in a 1:1 ratio on a paper filter attached to incubation media containing 200 μM acetosyringone (BLD Pharm). Selection of hygromycin (150 µM)-resistant strains was conducted by transferring the paper filter to PDA media with Hyg, cefotaxime, and spectinomycin (all at 50 μg/mL) and incubated for two days before the paper was eliminated from the media. The resistant strains from the media were tested by PCR using primers targeting the outside sequence and a Hyg sequence to determine whether the Hyg resistance cassette successfully replaced the interesting genes. The PCR primers used are listed in Supplementary Table5. The Ct3 and Ct4 lines constitutively expressing GFP were generated as previously described3. InoculatedA. thalianaroots were observed through confocal microscopy. To trace the colonization process of Ct3-GFP or Ct4-GFP in the roots, we utilized a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon C2 plus) equipped with filters optimized for visualization of GFP or mCherry to distinguish fungal hyphae and plant plasma membranes. Fungal lectin staining was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope Olympus FV1000 with filter settings suitable for fluorescein (FITC), i.e., blue excitation light. WGA-FITC conjugate (Sigma) was used to specify the fungal cell walls. Fungal-inoculated roots were incubated overnight in a 1:3 mixture of chloroform and ethanol. Then, the roots were transferred to chloral hydrate (2 g/mL in water) and incubated for 2 h. After PBS washed roots, the roots were incubated in wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to a FITC solution (5 µg/ml; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. DNA extraction, genome sequencing, and assembly were conducted as described34. De novo assembly of Ct4 genomes was conducted by FALCON-integrate (v. 1.8.18). Illumina HiSeq for 100 bp paired-end short reads against Ct4 genomes was also conducted by Macrogen (TrueSeq DNA PCR-Free kit), resulting in 59 million filtered reads. The filtered sequence reads were used for error collection by mapping Hiseq reads to the PacBio assembly using Pilon (v. 1.21). Syntenies of Ct3, Ct4, and Ct61 genomes were detected as locally collinear blocks (LCB) partly by performing whole-genome alignment in the Mauve program v1.1.158. The location of LCBs and synteny correlations were visualized as circos diagram by package circlize v.0.4.359in R. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using 6 fungal marker nucleotide sequences of 34 strains in 12 species of the genusColletotrichum. The 6 sequences used were the nuclear 5.8 S ribosomal RNA gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH), partial sequences of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), beta-tubulin (TUB2), histone 3 (HIS3) genes, as used previously to identify the species and species complexes of the genusColletotrichum23,25. Sequence information for all the strains was retrieved using BLAST. The sequences ofC. incanumMAFF 238704 andC. liriopesMAFF 242679 in GenBank were also used. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using MAFFT60and concatenated manually. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using IQ-TREE (v.2.1.2) with the options-m MFP -T AUTO -B 100061. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was also reconstructed using single-copy orthologs of all genomes of the genusColletotrichumin GenBank, those obtained in this study, and that ofB. cinereaB5.10 as an outgroup. The predicted proteins of the 71 fungal strains were clustered into single-copy orthologous groups using Orthofinder v.2.5.562and Mirlo (https://github.com/mthon/mirlo). Amino-acid sequences of the 1,509 single-copy orthologous groups were aligned using MAFFT with default settings60. The maximum-likelihood tree was reconstructed using IQ-TREE (v.2.0.3) with the options-m MFP -B 100061. For this analysis, we re-annotated putative ABA and BOT biosynthesis Ct (Ct3, Ct4, and Ct61) genes based on both genome assembly and RNA-seq expression data for each gene. Sequences similar to ABA and BOT genes ofColletotrichumstrains,B. cinerea, and some other strains were collected with BLASTP search using Biopython (v.1.7.6;E-value: 1e-4 or 1e-5) against newly analyzed genomes in this study,Homo sapiensgenome assembly GRCh38.p13, and GenBank NR database on February/March 2020. Those containing large indels or that were highly diverged were omitted from the data set of sequences (Supplementary Table3). Sequences were aligned with MAFFT using the E-INS-i strategy (v.7.273)60. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted with IQ-TREE (v.1.6.11; -m MFP -nt AUTO -b 100)61. Microsynteny of ABA and BOT genes was analyzed with GenomeMatcher (v.3.00)63. The fungal species tree in Fig.4mis followed by64. Total RNA was extracted from the whole root compartments using the NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Macherey-Nagel). RNA samples (1 µg each) were then sent to BGI for quality assurance, library preparation, and subsequent sequencing using their default process. The generated libraries were sequenced by HiSeq-illumina, resulting in approximately 40 million reads per sample, paired-end 150 bp (Figs.3and4) or BGIseq (Fig.8), resulting in about 40 million reads per sample, paired-end 100 bp. Tophat2 with default settings, except that average fragment size was specified65, was used for sequence mapping based on theA. thalianagenome (TAIR10) or fungal genomes. The generated BAM files from the Tophat2 platform were used to analyze DEGs by cuffdiff with default settings66. The following statistical analysis and data visualization were conducted in R Bioconductor packages, such as Cummerbund, gplots, and ggplot266,67. As judged by the Cummerbund platform, DEGs were identified using an FDR threshold of < 0.05. Heatmaps representing gene expression profiles were generated with the R package heatmap.2 in gplots. GO analysis forA. thalianagenes was conducted by AgriGO v. 2 (FDR < 0.0568). Motif analysis was conducted by CentriMo69with the default setting using 1000 bp upstream of the targetA. thalianagenes extracted via TAIR Bulk Data Retrieval. The mycelia of Ct were inoculated into 1 mL of both MPY and Mathur’s medium in a 5 mL test tube. The cultures were incubated at 25 °C with a constant rotational speed of 200 rpm for a period of 5 days. Following extraction with 2 mL of acetone, the extracts were evaporated. Subsequently, 1M-HCl was added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The crude extracts were then dissolved in methanol. After filtration of the crude extracts, the filtrates were directly analyzed by a GC-MS equipped with a Beta DEXTM120 fused silica capillary column (0.25 mm × 30 m, 0.25 μm film thickness; SUPELCO) in the following conditions (Method A); 100 °C for 3 min, 100-230 °C (rate: 14 °C/min), 230 °C for 5 min at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min (helium carrier gas). The followings are summary of other setting conditions; Column Oven Temp.: 100 °C, Injection Temp.: 230 °C, Pressure: 89.4 kPa, Total Flow: 28.1 mL/min, Column Flow: 1.2 mL/min, Linear Velocity: 40.7 cm/sec, Purge Flow: 3.0 mL/min, Split Ratio: 20.0, Ion Source Temp.: 200 °C, Interface Temp.: 230 °C, Solvent Cut Time: 2.5 min, Micro Scan Width: 0 u, and Mass range: 50-500. GCMSsolution software (version 4.45) was used for data acquisition and data analysis. After filtration of the crude extracts, the filtrates were directly analyzed by a UPLC-MS equipped with ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (2.1 × 50 mm) in the following conditions (Method B); 0-1 min = 10% B, 1-3 min = 10-95% B, 3-5 min = 95% B (A: H2O + 0.1% of formic acid, B: CH3CN + 0.1% of formic acid) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min; column temp. 40 °C. The followings are a summary of other setting conditions;λRange: 210 nm-400 nm, Resolution: 1.2 nm, Sampling Rate: 20 points/s, Filter Time Constant: 0.2 s, Exposure Time: auto. MassLynx V4.1 was used for data acquisition and data analysis. Mycelia of Ct was inoculated into a solid medium containing polished rice (1 g) in a 5 mL test tube. The culture was incubated at 25 °C for 5 days. After extraction with Ethyl acetate, the extract was concentrated in vacuo to afford crude extracts. After filtration of the crude extracts, the filtrates were directly analyzed by a GC-MS in Method A (see above). The crude extracts were evaporated, and the residues were then dissolved in MeOH. After filtration, the filtrates were directly analyzed by a UPLC-MS in Method B (see above). The ABA biosynthetic intermediates were isolated from the transformants constructed in our previous studies17,70. The BOT biosynthetic intermediates,9and10, were isolated from theA. oryzaetransformants possessing eitherBcBOT2/4/5orBcBOT1/2/3/4/5, which were constructed by incorporating those biosynthetic genes intoA. oryzaeapplying an established hot spot-knock-in method. Their1H- and13C-NMR spectra were in good agreement with the reported data35,36. Extraction, purification, and quantification of ABA were carried out as described in the previous report71using around 5-mg dry weights of around 10-day-seedling roots per replicate (equivalent to around 260 (Mock or Ct4)-320 (Ct3) roots). Plant samples were dried for 3 days in a 70 °C oven. Dried samples were set as 10-15 mg in one biological sample. Each sample was digested with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The dried pellets, after digestion, were dissolved in 0.08 M HNO3. Elemental concentrations in samples were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) Agilent 7800 (Agilent Technologies Co., Ltd., Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To determine the concentration of P, ICP-MS NexION 350 S (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. Clustering analysis was done by using mineral concentrations of the samples. NbClust package (version 3.0) of R was used for k-means clustering (Hartigan-Wong algorithm). An optimal number of clusters was determined by silhouette score. Sucrose extraction from the freeze-dried sample and its derivatization for GC/MS analysis were essentially carried out as previously described71. GC-EIMS used in this study was a 7890B GC-MS system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a DB-5 MS + Dura Guard (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., film thickness of 0.5 μm and 10 m Dura Guard, Agilent Technologies). The injection temperature was 250 °C, and the helium gas flow rate through the column was 0.9 mL/min. The column temperature was held at 60 °C for 1 min and then was raised by 10 °C/min to 325 °C and was held there for 10 min isothermally. The retention time for sucrose-8TMS was 16.4 min under the condition. Further information on research design is available in theNature Portfolio Reporting Summarylinked to this article.

However, some fungi benefit their hosts by aiding plant survival.Colletotrichum tofieldiae(Ct) is a root mold which typically supports continued plant development even when the plant is starved of phosphorus, an important nutrient for photosynthesis and growth. Researchers studied a unique pathogenic strain of the fungi, calledCt3, which conversely inhibits plant growth. By comparing the beneficial and harmfulCtstrains, they found that activation of a single fungal secondary metabolism gene cluster determined the negative impact of the fungus on the host plant. When the cluster was disrupted, either genetically or by a change in environment, the fungi’s behavior changed from inhibiting growth to promoting it. Understanding mechanisms like this could help us reduce food waste by harnessing the beneficial role fungi can have on food.
When your fresh strawberries go fuzzy with mold, or grapes turn gray and shrivel at the bottom of the fruit bowl, it’s always a bit disappointing and unpleasant. The culprit is typically a disease-causing fungus calledBotrytis, which devastates food crops globally and is easily spread by wind and soil. However, there are many fungi which have a less destructive relationship with their host plants, even forming partnerships which can help the plant to thrive. Promoting the beneficial traits of fungi and suppressing undesirable outcomes (like moldy fruit) would greatly aid global food security and help reduce a huge amount of food waste.
“Plant-associated fungi show varied infection lifestyles ranging from mutualistic (beneficial) to pathogenic (harmful) depending on the host enviroment. However, the mechanisms by which these microbes transit along these different lifestyles remain poorly understood,” said Associate Professor Kei Hiruma from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Tokyo. “We analyzed genetic information from varied strains of a root fungus calledColletotrichum tofieldiaeusing comparative transcriptomic analysis, which enabled us to study differences in gene expression between each strain. Surprisingly, we found that a single fungal secondary metabolism gene cluster, called ABA-BOT, solely determines whether the fungus exhibits pathogenic or mutualistic traits toward the host plant.”
Colletotrichum tofieldaeis a fungus which typically benefits plants when they suffer a phosphorus deficiency, helping them thrive despite the lack of this vital nutrient. It has even been shown to increase the growth and yield of economically important crops such as maize and tomatoes. In this study, the multi-institutional team used thale cress as the host plant and sourced six strains ofCtfrom different geographical locations to infect it with. Five strains significantly promoted plant growth, as expected, but a sixth — calledCt3— was found to suppress nutrient uptake, inhibiting plant growth and leading to symptoms of disease. So, what caused this drastic change?
“We identified two key points: First, on the fungal side, thatCt3activates the ABA-BOT biosynthesis gene cluster; and second, on the plant side, thatCt3induces the host plant’s ABA signaling pathways, through which the fungus inhibits plant growth,” explained Hiruma. The researchers found that both pathogenic and mutualistic strains ofColletotrichum tofieldaecontain the ABA-BOT gene cluster, but mutualistic strains did not express it, i.e., the genes were not activated. The discovery came as a surprise, as conventionally pathogens and mutualists were thought to have distinct characteristics, but these findings suggest that they are more intricately related.
When the gene cluster was disrupted, either at a genetic level or by changing the plant’s environment, theCt3was rendered nonpathogenic and even became beneficial to the host, promoting root growth. Although further study is needed, it appears that the ABA-BOT gene cluster may contribute to pathogenesis in diverse fungi beyond theCtspecies. For example, it may be involved in the pathogenesis of theBotrytiswhich afflicts our household fruit and vegetables. “If we gain a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing the fungal secondary metabolism gene cluster, we can devise a method to selectively suppress potential pathogenesis in otherwise beneficial fungi, optimizing their utilization in agriculture and harnessing the full potential of the microbial diversity naturally present in soil ecosystems,” said Hiruma.
“I have come to realize that even pathogens can exhibit nonharmful characteristics during a significant portion of their life cycles. In fact, I am beginning to contemplate the possibility that what we traditionally refer to as pathogens may actually function as beneficial microbes under other conditions.”
"
Origins of coronary arteries,"Coronary arteries are a critical part of the vascular system and provide nourishment to the heart. In humans, even minor defects in coronary arteries can be lethal, emphasizing their importance for survival. However, some teleosts survive without coronary arteries, suggesting that there may have been some evolutionary changes in the morphology and function of coronary arteries in the tetrapod lineage. Here, we propose that the true ventricular coronary arteries were newly established during amniote evolution through remodeling of the ancestral coronary vasculature. In mouse (Mus musculus) and Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) embryos, the coronary arteries unique to amniotes are established by the reconstitution of transient vascular plexuses: aortic subepicardial vessels (ASVs) in the outflow tract and the primitive coronary plexus on the ventricle. In contrast, amphibians (Hyla japonica,Lithobates catesbeianus,Xenopus laevis, andCynops pyrrhogaster) retain the ASV-like vasculature as truncal coronary arteries throughout their lives and have no primitive coronary plexus. The anatomy and development of zebrafish (Danio rerio) and chondrichthyans suggest that their hypobranchial arteries are ASV-like structures serving as the root of the coronary vasculature throughout their lives. Thus, the ventricular coronary artery of adult amniotes is a novel structure that has acquired a new remodeling process, while the ASVs, which occur transiently during embryonic development, are remnants of the ancestral coronary vessels. This evolutionary change may be related to the modification of branchial arteries, indicating considerable morphological changes underlying the physiological transition during amniote evolution. Mizukami et al. investigate the evolutionary origins of coronary arteries in amniotes by comparing vascular morphologies across several species and developmental timepoints. They propose that coronary arteries are a novel structure in amniotes and that they arose from an ancestral vascular network surrounding the outflow tract. The ancestral network is similar to, and may be a remnant of, the transient aortic subepicardial vessels (ASVs) seen in developing mouse and quail hearts. Coronary arteries are tasked with supplying the heart with oxygenated blood and nutrients. Any blockage or developmental problem in these blood vessels can have severe and sometimes lethal consequences. Due to their importance for health, researchers have extensively studied how coronary arteries form in humans and mice; a more limited range of studies have also looked at their equivalent in zebrafish. However, little is known about these structures develop in animals such as birds, amphibians, or other groups of fish. This makes it difficult to retrace the evolutionary processes that have given rise to the coronary arteries we are familiar with in mammals. To address this knowledge gap, Mizukami et al. set out to compare blood vessel development around the heart of mammals, birds, amphibians, and fish. To do this, they performed detailed anatomical studies of blood vessel structure at different stages of development in mice as well as quail, frogs and newts, zebrafish and sharks. In both mice and quail, small arterial subepicardial vessels (or ASVs) emerged early in development around the heart; these subsequently reorganised and remodelled themselves to give rise to the ‘true’ coronary arteries characteristic of the mature heart. Frogs and newts also developed similar ASV-like structures; however, unlike their mammalian and bird equivalents, these vessels did not reorganise, instead being retained into adulthood. In fish, blood vessel development resembled that of amphibians, suggesting that the coronary artery-like structures seen in some fish are an ‘ancestral’ form of ASVs, rather than the equivalent of the mature coronary arteries in mammals and birds. This work sheds light on the evolutionary processes shaping essential structures in the heart. In the future, Mizukami et al. hope that this knowledge will help develop a greater range of experimental animal models for studying heart disease and potential treatments. Coronary circulation refers to the network of blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle. In humans, disturbances in coronary flow caused by atherosclerosis and associated thrombosis lead to coronary artery disease, which can be lethal (Nabel and Braunwald, 2012;Khera and Kathiresan, 2017), indicating that coronary arteries distributed on the ventricles are essential for our survival. Despite their importance, the evolutionary origin of the coronary arteries remains uncertain. Because of the complete absence of coronary circulation in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes), the coronary artery is generally considered a synapomorphy of jawed vertebrates (Grant and Regnier, 1926). However, there is an inconsistency between amniotes and non-amniotes. In humans, the branching points (orifices) are located at the aortic sinuses close to the ventricle, and the arteries are distributed on the ventricular surface. Although the branching patterns of the vessels are diverse, the rostro-caudal level of the orifice and the distribution of the arteries on the ventricles are conserved in mammals, birds, crocodiles, and lepidosaurians (Figure 1A;Spalteholz, 1924;Erhart, 1935;MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981;Farrell et al., 2012). In teleosts and chondrichthyans, however, the orifices are located more cranially, with branching from the hypobranchial arteries, and the arteries pass long distances from the orifices to the heart (Parker, 1886;Grant and Regnier, 1926;Corrington, 1930;May and Herber, 1957;Halpern and May, 1958;De Andrés et al., 1990;Muñoz-Chápuli et al., 1994;Icardo, 2017). Such positional differences have led to two hypotheses: coronary arteries gradually shifted from the rostral to the caudal position (Halpern and May, 1958;MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981), or non-homologous arteries nourishing the heart are collectively termed coronary arteries (Grant and Regnier, 1926;May and Herber, 1957). Data on amphibians may help to address this controversy, although few comparative studies have examined their extrinsic blood vessels, and some authors have mentioned that amphibians lack coronary arteries (Kapuria et al., 2018;Lupu et al., 2020). (A) Scheme of lizard coronary artery based on the data for the lace monitor (Varanus varius). In this lizard, a single coronary artery originates from the root of the right systemicocarotid trunk (the aorta in mammals) close to the heart and bifurcates almost at its point of origin to form a ventral and a dorsal division. The figure is based onMacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981, with some modifications for clarity: we drew shadings and added the position of the pulmonary artery. (B) Resin-injected coronary vessels of the mouse (17.5 dpc) and quail (stage 28) embryos. Scale bars: 1 mm. Coronary arteries are morphologically diverse and are frequently lost among teleosts, indicating that they are not essential for survival in this group, unlike in amniotes (e.g.Grant and Regnier, 1926). Thus, the knowledge of the morphological evolution of coronary arteries may contribute to our understanding of physiological changes in the heart during the water-to-land transition. Here, we compared the anatomy and development of the coronary vasculature in various vertebrate lineages to clarify the evolution of the unique coronary circulation of amniotes. We first compared the anatomy of mice (Mus musculus) and Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica) to confirm the morphology of the coronary arteries. In a 17.5 days post-coitum (dpc) murine fetus, the two coronary arteries branched from the root of the aorta, part of the outflow tract (Figure 1BandFigure 1—figure supplement 1). They were distributed on the surface of the ventricle. Similarly, in quail at stage 28, the two coronary arteries branched from the aortic root and were distributed on the ventricular wall (Figure 1B). Their branching points and distribution patterns were identical to those in lizards and snakes (Figure 1A; seeMacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981). To investigate the early development of coronary arteries in mice, we performed immunohistochemical staining of pharyngula-stage embryos with antibody against PECAM-1. We found two distinct vessel structures: aortic subepicardial vessels (ASVs) and the primitive coronary plexus (The reconstructed image is inFigure 2Aalso seeFigures 2Band3A, B;Figure 2—figure supplement 1), in agreement withChen et al., 2014. By 10.5 dpc, the primitive coronary plexus was already visible as a dotted pattern on the ventricular surface. The ASVs formed plexuses surrounding the pharyngeal arteries and one small vessel opening to the outflow tract at the root of the left branch of the truncus arteriosus (arrowheads inFigure 2A,Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). At 11.5 dpc, the position of the ASV orifice was identical to that at 10.5 dpc (arrowheads). No vasculature was detected on the outflow trunk at 10.5 and 11.5 dpc, indicating that the ASVs of the pharyngeal arches and ventricular primitive coronary plexus were physically separated (Figure 2A,Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). By 12.5 dpc, the ASVs extended from the orifice on the outflow trunk (aorta), and their peripheral end was anastomosed with the primitive coronary vessels (arrow inFigure 2A). (A) Ventral views of three-dimensional reconstructed images of murine hearts. We visualized two types of primitive blood vessels: aortic subepicardial vessels (ASVs; pink) and primitive coronary plexuses (green). Although a plexus of vessels surrounded the ASVs, we visualized only the thickest vessels connected to the orifice (pink, indicated with arrowheads) to facilitate recognition. The ASV orifices were located at the bifurcation point of the outflow tract. We also found an extra orifice in the left carotid artery at 11.5 dpc (asterisk). At 12.5 dpc, the peripheral end of the ASV formed an anastomosis with the primitive coronary plexus at the outflow tract–ventricle boundary (arrow). Blood vessels were visualized using immunohistochemical staining for PECAM-1 (panel B andFigure 2—figure supplement 1). (B) Fluorescence images used to construct the three-dimensional images in (A). Transverse sections at the levels a–c in the left panel are shown in the right panels. The peripheral end of the ASV merged into the aorta (c). (C) Ventral views of three-dimensional reconstructed images of the hearts of the Japanese tree frog (Hyla japonica) constructed from histological sections show small vessels located on the outflow tract with orifices at the same location as in mice (arrowheads).

In 13.5 dpc embryos, the secondary orifice developed at the aortic root instead of the carotid artery orifice, which was lost (d).

Ao, aorta; LA, left atrium; RA, right atrium; Vent, ventricle. Scale bars: 500 µm (A, B), 100 µm (C, D). We also examined the development of the cardiac vasculature in Japanese tree frogs (Hyla japonica). In this species, larvae (tadpoles) are aquatic, but adults are terrestrial. In tadpoles (stage 33), we observed a small vasculature at the point of outflow tract bifurcation, with an orifice at the root of the left branch of the truncus arteriosus (Figure 2Ca). During metamorphosis (stage 42) and at the terrestrial juvenile stage (stage 46), the morphology of the truncus arteriosus did not change much, and the position of the orifice remained unchanged. At stage 46, the vessels that extended from the orifice were distributed on the outflow tract as truncal coronary vessels. On the basis of the positions of the orifices and the distribution patterns, these outflow truncal vessels in frogs were comparable to ASVs in mice. In contrast, no primitive coronary plexus was observed throughout the development in frogs. To understand late development of the coronary vasculature in amniotes, we conducted whole-mount immunohistochemistry with PECAM-1 staining in mice and quails. In mice at 13.5 dpc, the proximal part of the ASVs degenerated and the cranial half of the aorta became avascular (Figure 3A). Subsequently, ASVs disappeared and ventricular coronary arteries were established (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The development of quail was consistent with that of mice (Figure 3B). At stage 19, no QH-1-positive cells were observed on the surface of the outflow tract and a small vascular network was found around the pharyngeal arches. At stage 27, QH-1-positive endothelial cells formed a fine vascular plexus from the cranial part of the outflow tract toward the aortic root. At stage 35, the arterial plexuses of the aorta and pulmonary trunk degenerated and coronary arteries were formed secondarily on the ventricular surface. The above developmental process was consistent with that reported in previous studies in mice. Namely, a novel orifice is formed by an ingrowth from the connection of the ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus, and remodeling results in the secondary formation of the adult ventricular coronary arteries (Bogers et al., 1989;Red-Horse et al., 2010;Peng et al., 2013;Tian et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2014;Ivins et al., 2015;He and Zhou, 2018). To confirm this pattern and to understand whether it is common to other amniotes, such as birds, we conducted histological analysis in mice and quails. In 12.5 dpc mouse embryos, the ASV orifice was found at the root of the carotid artery (Figure 3Ca) and contained PECAM-1-positive endothelial cells (Figure 3Cb), as observed by confocal microscopy (Figure 2B). At the anastomosis point between ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus, a vessel continued to the aorta, forming a novel (secondary) orifice (Figure 3Cc; also seeFigure 2Bc,Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). At 13.5 dpc, the orifice of the carotid artery was lost and the secondary orifice became larger (Figure 3Cd). In quail embryos, ASVs were more finely reticulated than in mouse embryos, making it difficult to track their pathways; nevertheless, we found endothelial invasion into the aortic wall from the ASV network at the aortic root at stage 30 (Figure 3C). These results indicate that the amniote ASVs are formed as a continuous endothelial structure from the pharyngeal region to the vascular network around the aortic root and contribute to the formation of the secondary orifice of the coronary artery. Thus, the unique coronary arteries developed stepwise in amniotes through remodeling, establishing novel orifices, and reorganizing the vascular networks. To understand the development of coronary vessels in amphibians after metamorphosis, we examined the anatomy of some frogs and newts. In breeding-agedH. japonica, the orifice of the outflow coronary vessels opened in the left branch of the truncus arteriosus, particularly at the root of the carotid trunk (Figure 4A). Thus, the topographical position of the coronary vessel was the same as at the juvenile stage (stage 46;Figure 2C). Histologically, these vessels were distributed on the surface of the outflow tract, but not on the ventricle. Examination of the ink-injected hearts of the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) was consistent with this result (Figure 4B). (A) In the Japanese tree frog (Hyla japonica), the ASV-like vessels (pink arrowheads) branched from the aortic trunk close to the root of the carotid artery. (B) Ink-injected heart of African bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus; tadpole). (C) Development of the extrinsic cardiac arteries ofXenopus laevis. Ink injection visualized the blood vessels. In adultX. laevis, the ASV-like vessels branched from the carotid artery in the aortic trunk (a). (D) Ink-injected heart of the adult Japanese fire-belly newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster). The boxed area in the left image is enlarged and slightly rotated so that the distribution of blood vessels can be easily seen. Histological sections (a–c) show that the ASV-like vessels had an orifice at the root of the carotid artery (a), and it continued in the outflow tract (b, c). Arrowheads indicate extrinsic arteries on the outflow tract. Scale bars: 500 µm. In the aquatic frogXenopus laevisat stage 54, the outflow coronary vessels were first found at the point of the outflow tract bifurcation, particularly at the root of the left branch of the truncus arteriosus (Figure 4C). At stage 60, the arterial plexus expanded on the outflow tract to reach the aortic root. This vascular pattern was maintained throughout the development into the adult stage. On the other hand, no blood vessels were found on the ventricular surface. A histological section of the truncus arteriosus revealed some internal septa and the orifice of the outflow coronary vessels open at the root of the carotid trunk (Figure 4Ca). We found the above vascular distribution to be conserved not only in Anura but also in Urodela, such as the breeding-aged Japanese fire-belly newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster). This specie also had ASV-like vessels above the outflow tract, whose orifice opened into the left branch of the truncus arteriosus (Figure 4D). These findings suggest that frogs develop a vascular network that is morphologically similar to that of the ASVs and is arranged directly on the outflow tract as thick truncal coronary vessels, whereas the ventricle has no vascular network on its surface. Given the similarity of adult anatomical structures, the development of these ASV-like vessels is likely common to anuran and urodele amphibians. As we found that coronary arteries are divergent between amniotes and amphibians, we examined coronary veins in this respect. In amniotes, blood supplied by coronary arteries enters coronary veins and is collected in one trunk, which opens into the sinus venosus (Grant and Regnier, 1926;Figure 5A). In 15.5 dpc mouse embryos, the connections of the coronary artery and the vein were established (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Ink-injected hearts are shown. (A) Mouse. (B) American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) and the Japanese fire-belly newt (Cynops pyrrhogaster). (C)Xenopus laevis. Arteries (pink arrowheads) and veins (blue arrows) were found on the surface of the outflow tract. In (B) and (C), the coronary vein (blue arrows) branched from the sinus venosus and reached the outflow tract. (D) Summary. BA, bulbus arteriosus; BC, bulbus cordis; TA, truncus arteriosus; Vent, ventricle Scale bars: 1 mm. In amphibians, a vascular system distinct from truncal ASV-like vessels was found in the outflow tract, which connected to a single tube and opened into the sinus venosus (Figure 5B and C). Although peripheral vessels were not distributed on the ventricle, as in amniotes, their brancheing points were in the same position (Figure 5D), and this vessel should be regarded as a coronary vein in amphibians. Thus, unlike coronary arteries, the coronary vein is likely conserved between amniotes and amphibians. To further investigate the evolutionary history of coronary arteries, we checked their morphology in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) and chondrichthyans. In adultflk1:egfpzebrafish (72 days post-fertilization, dpf), a peripheral network of coronary vessels was found throughout the entire surface of the ventricle (Figure 6A). These ventricular coronary arteries led to the heart over a long distance directly from the hypobranchial artery, which branched off from the branchial arches (Figure 6A and B), in agreement withHu et al., 2001. Before reaching the ventricle, this hypobranchial artery bifurcated and its two branches extended ventrally and dorsally to connect to the vascular network on the ventricular wall. Unlike the ASVs of amniotes and in sharp contrast to the ASV-like vessels of amphibians, these vessels in the zebrafish were not distributed in the walls of the outflow tract. (A, B)flk1:egfpzebrafish at 72 dpf (juvenile). (B) Three-dimensional image. (C)flk1:egfpzebrafish at 36, 46, and 50 dpf. The hypobranchial arteries (pink) arose from the dorsal side of the pharyngeal arch arteries. The vascular network (green) appeared on the ventricular surface at 46 dpf and connected with the hypobranchial artery at 50 dpf. The numbers indicate the branchial arteries. (D) Chondrichthyans. The anatomical pattern of the hypobranchial and coronary arteries was identical to that of zebrafish. BA, bulbus arteriosus; CA, conus arteriosus; VA, ventral aorta; Vent, ventricle. Scale bars: 100 µm. At the late pharyngula stage (31–38 hr post-fertilization, hpf) offlk1:egfpzebrafish embryos, the Y-shaped hypobranchial artery appeared in the midline of the pharyngeal region, and its lateral branches bilaterally connected with the first pharyngeal arteries of the mandibular arch (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). The mid-caudal branch of the Y-shaped artery extended caudally toward the cardiac outflow tract. After hatching (48–72 hpf), it further extended along the ventral aorta (3–14 dpf) and formed a vascular plexus on the aorta around 21 dpf (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Around 36 dpf (juvenile stage), the hypobranchial artery was identified as a vessel running on the ventral side of the ventral aorta (Figure 6B). At 45 dpf, a vascular plexus was formed on the ventricle close to the aortic root, and part of it ttransiently covered the bulbus arteriosus (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). At 46 dpf, it formed connections with the mid-caudal elongation of the hypobranchial artery (Figure 6C,Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). The formation of ventricular coronary arteries was complete by around 50 dpf, slightly before the adult stage. In the zebrafish, the hypobranchial artery originates in the region of branchial arteries and the ventricular vascular plexus originates at the ventricle; in this respect, they are similar to ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus in amniotes, respectively. However, the zebrafish does not form a novel orifice in proximity to the heart and does not lose or reconstitute the above vessels. The hypobranchial artery is not a temporary structure and is maintained as the trunk of the coronary artery even in adults. In chondrichthyans, we found anatomical features similar to those of adult zebrafish, although their arteries supply the wall of the outflow tract (Figure 6D). InLamnasp. andNarke japonica, the coronary artery originated from a vessel further cephalad than the bulbus arteriosus (outflow tract). InDeania calcea, the arterial trunk branched from the branchial artery bifurcated on the conus arteriosus (outflow tract) and then supplied its peripheral branches to the ventricle. We also compared the histology of the ventricles in fetuses and adults of each species to gain insights into the relationships between the morphology of coronary vasculature and ventricular structures (Figure 7). The sagittal sections of the hearts of various jawed vertebrates. For the mouse,Hyla japonica, andCynops pyrrhogasterhistological sections stained with HE and Alcian blue are shown. For the lungfish (P. annectens) and coelacanth (L. chalumnae), micro CT and MRI scanned images are shown, respectively. Quail and shark (Lamnasp.) hearts were cut by hand. The distribution of coronary arteries is shown in the schemes. We could not observe any coronary arteries in the lungfish and coelacanths because of low resolution; the distribution of the arteries in the lungfish is based on previous reports (Szidon et al., 1969;Laurent et al., 1978). Vent, ventricle. Mice and quails have thick ventricular walls. Even in 17.5 dpc murine fetuses, the myocardial wall was thick, albeit not as thick as in adult quails. On the other hand, the ventricular wall of amphibians was spongy and thin, even in adults. In the non-tetrapod sarcopterygians lungfish and coelacanth, ventricular walls were also spongy. Because of the limited resolution, we could not find coronary arteries in these two species. The previous studies suggest that the coronary arteries of lungfish are distributed exclusively in the outflow tract, like those of amphibians (Szidon et al., 1969;Laurent et al., 1978). However, zebrafish and sharks, which have ventricular coronary arteries, also have spongy ventricles. Although chondrichthyans have compact layers, they are also thin (Icardo, 2017). In adultLamnasp., the lumen was fimbriated and reached close to the wall. Thus, histologically, there does not seem to be a clear correlation between the presence or absence of coronary circulation in the ventricle and its histological structure. Our results suggest that the myocardium of the ventricles of mice and quails is thick and uniform rather than spongy. However,Jensen et al., 2013a;Jensen et al., 2013bsuggested that lizard and snake hearts are spongy, whereas they have the amniote-type ventricular coronary arteries (MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981), indicating that the establishment of these arteries may not correlate with ventricular wall thickness. Since Ibn al-Nafis discovered coronary arteries in the 13th century (Numan, 2014), their developmental origin has been controversial. Traditionally, it was believed that ventricular coronary arteries originate from the aortic wall in amniotes through outgrowth and sprouting angiogenesis (Bennett, 1936;Hutchins et al., 1988). However, more recent studies have demonstrated in mice that amniote-type ventricular coronary arteries develop through the reconstitution of embryonic vessels (ASVs) and the primitive coronary plexus, with the ingrowth formation of orifices (Bogers et al., 1989;Red-Horse et al., 2010;Peng et al., 2013;Tian et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2014;Ivins et al., 2015;He and Zhou, 2018). Our present results suggest that the coronary artery develops via reconstitution of the primitive vessels in mice and quails and this developmental process should be unique to amniotes. In frogs and newts, we found that cardiac vessels are limited to the truncal outflow region and are composed of ASV-like vessels and the coronary vein. Frogs and newts have no primitive coronary plexus on the ventricle. Accordingly, remodeling to ventricular coronary arteries with secondary orifices does not occur in amphibians. These truncal ASV-like vessels of amphibians are identical to the ASVs of amniotes in topographical relationships: their orifices open at the root of the carotid artery (third pharyngeal artery derivative) and are distributed in the outflow tract in the same way. Given these anatomical connections, the ASVs of amniotes and ASV-like vessels of amphibians should be morphologically homologous. The molecular identity of these vessels remains uncertain. In mice, ASVs are considered blood vessels because they contain erythrocytes and connect to the aortic endothelium; however, a subset of early ASV endothelial cells expressProx1,Vegfr3, andLyve1, which are markers for lymphatic vessels (Chen et al., 2014;Maruyama et al., 2019). This suggests a lymphatic vessel–like identity of mouse ASVs, although they function as blood vessels, and their origin has been speculated to be fromProx1+cells, which also give rise to cardiac lymphatic vessels (Maruyama et al., 2021). The cardiac expression ofProx1,Vegfr3, andLyve1orthologs in amphibians remains unknown. Recent identification of several endothelium-specific transcription factors by high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (Liao et al., 2022) will enable the comparisons of the amphibian vessels with ASV-specific molecular markers. To determine whether the coronary circulation of anurans and urodeles is ancestral to that of amniotes, it is necessary to perform outgroup comparisons. Caecilians, the third group of extant amphibians, have a unique coronary circulation that is distinct from that of any other vertebrate group. InHypogeophis rostratus, the so-called coronary arteries supply the heart tissue directly from the trabecular spaces of the ventricle (Lawson, 1966), andEpicrionopsreportedly has no coronary arteries (Wilkinson, 1996). Thus, the morphology of caecilian arteries differs from that of ASV-like vessels. On the other hand, the coronary veins of caecilians branch from the sinus venosus (Lawson, 1966;Wilkinson, 1996), as observed in mice, frogs, and newts (Figure 5). We suggest that caecilian coronary arteries are unlikely to be ancestral to those of other amphibians. Vessels similar to ASV-like vessels, which branch off the third pharyngeal arch artery, are distributed on the outflow tract, and end at the level of the outflow–ventricle junction, have been observed in the African lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus;Szidon et al., 1969;Laurent et al., 1978). The South American lungfish (Lepidosiren paradoxa) has similar vessels on the outflow tract, although their cranial part connects to the branchial arteries via the hypobranchial artery (Foxon, 1950), similar to our findings in zebrafish and shark. Coronary arteries originating from the branchial region and crossing the subepicardium of the coronary outflow tract are shared by the actinopterygian bichir (Polypterus senegalus) and chondrichthyans, although the locations of their orifices are uncertain (Durán et al., 2014;Lorenzale et al., 2018). Thus, the vascular connection from the pharyngeal region to the outflow tract, as seen in ASVs, is phylogenetically ancestral, and coronary arteries unique to caecilians are a derived trait likely associated with their heart being located near the middle of the body, which is also a derived trait. Histologically, ASV-like vessels in tadpoles are small and may have the identities of both lymphatic and blood vessels, similar to ASVs in mice. However, in adults, they thicken to form outflow tract vessels and contain numerous blood cells (Figure 4), indicating their function as mature blood vessels. Since these vessels constitute a network with coronary veins derived from the sinus venosus in their periphery, ASV-like vessels in tadpoles become arteries in adult amphibians. Comparison with the morphology of lungfish, bichir, and shark vessels suggests that amphibian ASV-like vessels are the ancestral form of coronary arterial vessels in jawed vertebrates, with ASVs in amniotes representing remnants of this form. While amniote ASVs have probably lost their arterial function, they may be maintained as embryonic primordia for the subsequent development. Thus, the existence of ASVs in amniotes may be explained as developmental burden (Riedl, 1978), which is typically exemplified by notochords in vertebrates (Fujimoto et al., 2022). Whereas the ancestral form of coronary arteries is conserved among mammals, birds, and amphibians (except caecilians) as ASVs or ASV-like vessels, the coronary circulation of fishes is highly diverse and whether it is homologous to that of tetrapods remains unclear (e.g.Grant and Regnier, 1926). Coronary vasculature is most variable in teleosts. Fish hearts are often classified into four typesbased on the histological distribution of coronary arteries on the ventricle (Tota et al., 1983;Tota, 1989;Icardo, 2017). Some teleosts lack any extrinsic cardiac circulation, but this has been regarded as a derived trait because non-teleost actinopterygians (e.g. bichirs) and chondrichthyans have cardiac vessels (De Andrés et al., 1990;Farrell et al., 2012;Durán et al., 2014;Farrell and Smith, 2017;Lorenzale et al., 2018). It is generally thought that the lower need for external oxygenation probably causes the lack of ventricular coronary circulation due to the acquisition of spongy heart walls. However, it is unclear whether and how the presence or absence of ventricular coronary arteries correlates with the histological characteristics of the ventricles (Figure 7). Among chondrichthyans, the posterior coronary arteries develop as branches of the subclavian arteries in some stingrays (Muñoz-Chápuli et al., 1994). Similar arteries are sometimes found even in amniotes, termed conus arteries, although they are distributed only on a small part of the ventricle (Schlesinger et al., 1949;Simons, 1965). Creating a comprehensive scheme for the coronary system in fishes, especially teleosts, is challenging due to its complexity. However, on the basis of our observations of zebrafish, we can generally interpret teleost coronary arteries as originating from at least two vascular networks: a branchial region network and a primitive coronary plexus. Vessels from these networks anastomose at the boundary between the outflow tract and the ventricles, similar to anastomosis between ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus in amniotes. However, unlike in amniotes, they do not undergo remodeling and remain connected to form adult coronary arteries. Furthermore, these vessels are detached from the walls of the outflow tract and are connected to multiple branchial arteries through hypobranchial arteries, unlike ASV-like vessels in amphibians, bichir, and chondrichthyans (Figure 6). Because morphological comparison is difficult, we cannot identify the strict organ-level homology between ASVs and zebrafish hypobranchial arteries. Nevertheless, as the vascular structures derived from the pharyngeal arch to supply the aortic sinus, zebrafish hypobranchial arteries and related vessels undergo the same developmental processes in the same embryonic domain as ASVs, which should be considered as the same developmental module. In zebrafish,Paffett-Lugassy et al., 2017reported that the hypobranchial artery endothelium is derived from the second heart field (termed cardiopharyngeal mesoderm byDiogo et al., 2015) in the pharyngeal arch. Although there is no direct evidence that amniote ASVs or amphibian ASV-like vessels originate from the second heart field or cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, the mouse periaortic lymphatic endothelium overlapping with ASVs originates from theIslet1-positive pharyngeal core mesoderm (Maruyama et al., 2019), and it is quite plausible that ASV distribution coincides with the mesodermal domains mentioned above. If the distribution of vascular structures corresponds to that of the mesenchyme, similar to the tight correspondence between distributions of neural crest cells and the trigeminal nerve in the face (Higashiyama et al., 2021), the variations in vascular distribution between species may indicate differences in the mesenchymal contribution to the heart. It should be noted that adult ventricular coronary arteries differ in their endothelial cell lineage, even in the same class animals (Table 1 inKapuria et al., 2018). For example, in zebrafish, ventricular circulation is provided by the endocardium of the atrioventricular junction (Harrison et al., 2015); in gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus), it is derived solely from the hypobranchial arteries (Shifatu et al., 2018); in the giant danio (Devario malabaricus), it arises from the hypobranchial artery and the atrioventricular junction (Shifatu et al., 2018). These differences may be caused by the differences between species in the contribution of embryonic vessels. The developmental origin of the endothelial cells of the adult ventricular coronary vasculature also varies among amniotes (e.g.Kapuria et al., 2018), indicating that the relative contribution of ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus to adult coronary arteries varies among jawed vertebrates. It is not certain whether these cell lineage differences affect the vessels' morphological identity. If they do not affect it, it could be regarded as an example of developmental system drift (True and Haag, 2001), but further research is needed on this issue. In summary, the origin of the coronary arteries of jawed vertebrates may be defined by the presence of the pharyngeal vessels (e.g., ASVs, amphibian ASV-like vessels, and hypobranchial arteries) and the primitive coronary plexus, and these two vascular networks have combined to produce a variety of coronary vasculature morphologies. The causes of the acquisition of novel amniote-type coronary arteries through remodeling are unclear. Coronary artery remodeling in amniotes can hardly be attributed solely to functional changes in the ventricles because lizards and snakes have spongy ventricles (Jensen et al., 2013a;Jensen et al., 2013b) but also have the amniote-type coronary arteries. Thus, the amniote-specific coronary artery remodeling may be related to morphological changes in the pharyngeal region rather than to functional requirements (Figure 8A). (A) The ventricular coronary arteries unique to amniotes are reconstituted from the ASVs and the primitive coronary plexus. The ASV-like vessels of amphibians and the hypobranchial arteries of fishes are comparable to the ASVs, rather than to the ventricular coronary arteries of amniotes. It remains unclear whether the ventricular artery in chondrichthyans arises as an extension of the hypobranchial artery or has a different developmental origin. As ventricular arteries have a variety of developmental sources in teleosts, ancestral vessels in this region may have had a variety of developmental origins in different animal species. In amniotes, such redundant coronary arterial development gave way to a single robust and unchangeable developmental program, resulting in developmental constraints. (B) A scheme of congenital coronary artery abnormalities according toKim et al., 2009. The cardiopharyngeal structures in tetrapods have progressively changed during the water-to-land transition to form the amniote bauplan adapted to arid land. Branchial arches have changed into neck structures, and a long neck has formed in the amniotes with the morpho-functional separation of the head and pectoral girdle. Simultaneously, the heart, located ventral to the pharynx, moved back into the thorax and became separated from the pharyngeal structures (Hirasawa et al., 2016). This heterotopic shift of the heart inevitably resulted in various reorganizations of the pharyngeal arch derivatives, such as the recurrent laryngeal nerves of the vagus, which have been modified into a peculiar route without altering their anatomical connections (Higashiyama et al., 2016a). It seems reasonable to speculate that such reorganization of the branchial arteries may have influenced the establishment of true coronary arteries with secondary orifices. Myocardial thickening in mammals and birds may have resulted from the pre-existence of amniote-type coronary arteries, making coronary arteries essential for survival. Only one exception is known among amniotes. The orifice in turtles is in the middle of the carotid artery, as it is in frogs (Spalteholz, 1924;Grant and Regnier, 1926;MacKinnon and Heatwole, 1981), suggesting that the amniote-type coronary arteries were lost secondarily in the turtle lineage. Thus, transient ASV formation is conserved during development even after the acquisition of true coronary arteries, enabling them to return from the amniote type to the ancestral type. The loss of amniote-type coronary arteries in turtles might be related to the peculiar morphogenesis of the shoulder girdle in this lineage (Nagashima et al., 2009), but the extent to which this structural change affects cardiac function remains unknown. The evolutionary origin of extrinsic cardiac arteries is still a mystery. Cyclostomes do not have coronary circulation, but whether this is the ancestral condition or a secondary loss is uncertain (Grant and Regnier, 1926). If they have retained the ancestral pattern, the establishment of extrinsic cardiac vessels may be related to the heterotopic shift of the cardiac region and head–trunk interface in the ancestor of gnathostomes (Higashiyama et al., 2016a), although further studies are warranted in this lineage. Using the present theory, we can explain some congenital coronary artery abnormalities, an uncommon disease entity covering a broad spectrum of abnormalities (Figure 8B). Although many cases remain asymptomatic and are incidentally found by coronary angiography, these abnormalities sometimes cause sudden death (Taylor et al., 1992;Yuan, 2014;Villa et al., 2016). In particular, the anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the innominate (brachiocephalic) artery or adjacent aortic arch is accompanied by other severe anomalies and is often lethal (Davis and Lie, 1977;Asada et al., 2019;Pandey et al., 2019), although some patients survive (Santucci et al., 2001;Duran et al., 2008;Kim et al., 2009). Since the brachiocephalic artery is derived from the right third pharyngeal arch artery and they pass across the ventral side of the ascending aorta, the anomalous coronary arteries in these reports are similar to ASVs. Thus, this type of anomaly can be considered persistent embryonic vasculature. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the ventricular coronary artery, a common feature in amniotes, originated through ancestral cardiovascular remodeling during the evolution of amniotes. It is possible that this artery was necessary for the thickening of the ventricular wall, which is associated with high physiological activity. It is still undeniable that coronary artery formation through ASV remodelling may be a convergent evolution of mammals and birds. The resemblance of coronary arterial morphology in adult squamates to that of mammals and birds may reflect a potential common developmental process, although further research is required to delve deeper into this aspect. This new understanding of the evolutionary history and morphology of coronary circulation will be useful in evolutionary research on amniotes and in comparisons among animal models to study coronary artery disease. Wild-type mice (Mus musculus) of the ICR background were kept in an environmentally controlled room at 23 ± 2°C with a relative humidity of 50–60% under a 12 hr light: 12 hr dark cycle. Embryonic ages were determined by timed mating, with the day of the plug being 0.5 dpc. Eggs of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were obtained from Motoki Hatchery (Saitama, Japan). They were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C until the embryos reached appropriate stages (Ainsworth et al., 2010). African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) were obtained from the WatanabeXenopus-inbred strain resource center (Hyogo, Japan) and were kept at room temperature (RT). The embryonic stage was determined as inNieuwkoop et al., 1994. Japanese tree frogs (Hyla japonica) were caught in Tsukuba (Ibaraki, Japan), and American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) were caught in Oyamadairi Park (Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan) according to the laws of the Invasive Alien Species Act. Japanese fire-belly newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster) were obtained from Kingyozaka (Tokyo, Japan). Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were maintained as described byFukuhara et al., 2014. In addition to the wild-type zebrafish, we used Tg(flk1:egfp) mutant zebrafish according toFukuhara et al., 2014. Embryos and larvae were staged by hpf and dpf at 28–28.5°C (Kimmel et al., 1995). Chondrichthyan samples were obtained through fish markets, mainly from incidental bycatch. The hearts of salmon shark (Lamnasp.) were obtained from Yoshiike (Tokyo, Japan), Japanese sleeper rays (Narke japonica) were from Induka Shouten (Nagasaki, Japan), and the fetuses of bird-beak dogfish (Deania calcea) were from Gyosai-ya (Tokyo, Japan). Lungfish (Protopterus annectens) was purchased from Meitosuien (Nagoya, Japan) and the heart was dissected out under anesthesia with 0.2% tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222, Sigma Chemical Co.). The heart of coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) was dissected from the juvenile individual used for other experiment (Nikaido et al., 2013). Data for lungfish and coelacanth were obtained from a single sample, but all other data are based on at least four samples; as we found no differences among the samples, we did not specify the sample size in the text. All animal experiments were approved by the University of Tokyo Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines and the Act on Welfare and Management of Animals. To prepare cryosections, samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS overnight at 4 °C and washed with PBS. The samples were transferred consecutively into 10% sucrose in PBS, 30% sucrose in PBS, and 30% sucrose in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue Tek, Sakura Finetek, Tokyo, Japan) for 30 min at 4 °C for each step, and embedded in 100% OCT compound. The embedded block was stored at −20 °C before use. The samples were cryosectioned (8–12 µm thick). To prepare paraffin sections, samples were fixed with Serra’s solution (a mixture of formalin, ethanol, and acetic acid at 7:2:1) overnight and stored in 70% ethanol at RT. The samples were dehydrated stepwise with an ethanol-to-xylene series and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin blocks were cut into 6- to 9-µm-thick sections. The sections were stained with Alcian blue, hematoxylin, and eosin by using the standard protocol (HE staining). Cryosections were blocked with 1% skim milk in PBS with 0.5% Tween-20 at RT for 15 min and incubated with primary monoclonal antibody (rat anti-mouse PECAM-1 [CD31; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA; 1:400] or mouse monoclonal anti-QH-1 [Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; 1:100]) at 4 °C overnight. The sections were washed in PBS four times at RT and incubated with Alexa Fluor–conjugated secondary antibodies (Abcam, 1:400) for 1 hr. The sections were washed in PBS five times and mounted with Aqua-Poly/Mount (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Fluorescence signals were visualized under a computer-assisted confocal microscope (Nikon D-Eclipse C1), and images were processed using NIS Elements software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The same protocol was followed for whole-mount hearts and embryos, except that they were incubated with secondary antibodies overnight. Some sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using the Vectastain ABC System (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images of histological sections or confocal images were loaded into the Amira software platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a voxel size appropriate to section thickness. To visualize coronary arteries,Xenopus laevis, red-bellied newts, and American bullfrogs were anesthetized at appropriate stages on ice or with 0.1% tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222; Wako, Japan). Ink (Kiwa-Guro, Sailor, Japan) was gently injected using a glass micropipette from the hepatic portal vein. The hearts were then collected and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. The samples were cleared by CUBIC solution (Susaki et al., 2014) and examined under a stereo microscope. Mouse and quail hearts were injected with latex or resin as inHigashiyama et al., 2016b. Samples were fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, trimmed, and immersed in the CUBIC solution overnight at RT. Fluorescence signals were visualized under the Nikon D-Eclipse C1 microscope; z-stack images (2–5 µm) were used. A multi-photon excitation microscope (FV1000MPE, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a water immersion 20×lens (XLUMPlanFL, 1.0NA, Olympus) was used. Sequential images were processed with FV10-ASW 3.1 viewer (Olympus) and analyzed with the Imaris software (Bitplane, Belfast, UK). The lungfish heart was fixed with 4% PFA and gradually dehydrated with the series of ethanol and then treated with 0.3% phosphotungstic acid (PTA; Wako, Japan) in 70% ethanol for 4 days according toMetscher, 2009. Images were acquired with a SkyScan 1172 scanner (Bruker) as following parameters; source voltage = 100 kV, source current = 100 µA, image pixel size = 10.14 µm, exposure = 295ms, and rotation step = 0.460 degree. The magnetic resonance image of the sample was acquired with a magnetic resonance imaging system using a vertical-bore 4.7 Tesla superconducting magnet (Hashimoto et al., 2014). The acquisition parameters are as follows: field of view (FOV)=25.6 mm cube, number of image matrix = 256 cube, voxel size = 100 microns cube, pulse sequence = three-dimensional spin-echo sequence, repetition time (TR)=200ms, echo time (TE)=12ms, number of signal accumulation = 2, and image acquisition time = 7.3 hr.

The morphogen FGF8 establishes graded positional cues imparting regional cellular responsesviamodulation of early target genes. The roles of FGF signaling and its effector genes remain poorly characterized in human experimental models mimicking early fetal telencephalic development. We used hiPSC-derived cerebral organoids as anin vitroplatform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic domains, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. Organogenesis requires the proper production of diverse cell types and their positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs; Z1 and Z4). We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1(RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.","Coronary arteries are a vital part of the human heart, providing it with oxygen-rich blood so that it can work. By comparing the hearts of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and frogs, a multi-institutional team of researchers appears to have found evidence that the structure of our hearts evolved in a stepwise process from fish, through amphibians to reptiles to mammals. When animals evolved from living in the water to living on land, a significant remodeling of the blood vessels to the heart occurred, enabling survival without gills. Understanding the ancestral origins of our cardiovascular system could help us find the basis for certain genetic defects. Knowing the systems of various other animals also broadens the scope for studying heart disease and potential treatments.
How do you take care of your heart? Being active, reducing stress and eating heart-healthy foods can all help to protect and strengthen this vital organ. Unfortunately, congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect worldwide. CHD refers to a range of issues, including anomalous coronary artery, where the coronary arteries are malformed. These arteries supply the heart with oxygenated blood, so if they are not properly developed then it can cause sudden and dangerous complications. But not all species have this problem. There are animals including fish and amphibians whose hearts don’t have or need coronary arteries. So why do we and where did they come from?
To help answer these questions, researchers in Japan compared the development of blood vessels in the hearts of mice, Japanese quails, newts, zebrafish, sharks and frogs. The team used a combination of techniques, including MRI, micro-CT scans, sectioning (analyzing thin slices of the hearts under a microscope) and 3D reconstruction, to create detailed images. By comparing these images, they could see the difference in how the blood vessels (vascular system) develop in the hearts of amniotes, i.e., mammals, birds and reptiles, and non-amniotes, i.e., fish, sharks and amphibians, from embryos to adults.
“In fish, sharks and amphibians, a long vascular system extending from the gills supplies blood to the heart. By contrast, in mammals and birds, this ancestral vasculature exists only during the embryo stage and later transforms into adult coronary arteries which are wrapped around the heart. This evolutionary change is likely connected to the transition of vertebrates from water to land, which led to the loss of gills,” explained researcher Hiroki Higashiyama from the Department of Physiological Chemistry and Metabolism at the Graduate School of Medicine at the University of Tokyo.
Amphibians sit in between fish and mammals on the evolutionary tree and so may offer some insight as to how one type of heart evolved into the other. “As an example, we saw that the transient blood vessels observed in mice embryos bore a striking resemblance to the ancestral vascular system found in amphibians,” said Higashiyama. “As the mouse's coronary arteries form, these ancestral vessels disappear, but they act as essential starting points for creating the new coronary arteries.”
The results appeared to show that the structure of the human heart originated from a common amniote ancestor. When this animal transitioned from being a water dweller to living on land, an important development took place which involved significant remodeling of ancestral blood vessels to form the coronary arteries we have today. The researchers speculated that this was necessary to enable a thickening of the human heart’s ventricle wall, so that it could handle high physiological activity, such as the elevated blood pressure that maintains amniotes’ high metabolic capacity (the ability to take on oxygen and circulate it in the blood).
“This research broadens the range of animal models available for studying heart diseases and their treatments,” said Higashiyama. “Next we would like to gain a deeper understanding of the molecular processes involved in coronary artery remodeling. By doing so, we can uncover the mechanisms of ‘how’ the mammalian- and reptilian-type coronary arteries evolved and potentially shed light on human congenital heart abnormalities and diseases.”

The process usually wastes a lot of material required to support the unfinished object. Some novel ways to make flat materials self-fold into 3D shapes exist, but have shortcomings. For the first time, researchers combined 2D printing, origami, and chemistry to create a method of rapid 3D object fabrication without creating any waste material. These shapes self-fold in seconds.
For some time, 3D printing has been used to prototype products and is now seeing more use in the fabrication of commercial items, including even parts for jet engines. But every method of 3D fabrication comes with limitations, such as the long time taken to complete prints or the wastage of vestigial materials in printing. 4D printing is a concept that aims to mitigate these issues using a minimal amount of materials, selected for having certain special properties, allowing them to self-fold into complex 3D shapes under the right conditions. It’s called 4D printing, as the process of self-folding necessarily makes use of time, which is often said to be the 4th dimension. Ironically, a new method of rapid 4D printing begins in the 2D realm.
“My team and I discovered how to use accessible tools and materials to create self-folding 4D objects,” said Project Assistant Professor Koya Narumi from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems at the University of Tokyo. “Essentially, we’re creating flat sheets with origami patterns on them, and these patterns can be complex, taking even a skilled origami artist hours to form. But thanks to our special process, you can pour hot water over these flat sheets and watch as they spring into complex 3D shapes in a matter of seconds.”
The technique utilizes a special kind of inkjet printer made for printing with UV-reactive materials — although the machine itself can cost tens of thousands of dollars, they are often found within maker communities and shared workshops. This printer prints a 2D origami design onto both sides of a plastic sheet that shrinks with heat. The ink it uses doesn’t shrink and can stay flexible when dry. As the base sheet shrinks when heated and the ink resists the shrinking, by leaving gaps between sections of ink on one side or the other, the designer can control which way a certain section of the sheet folds. Hot water is used to apply heat across the flat sheet so that it spontaneously folds into an intricate origami construction.
“Our biggest challenge was refining the options for hardware and materials, which took over a year to narrow it down to the final choices,” said Narumi. “But all the trial and error was worth it; compared to previous research around this same basic idea, we’ve improved the output resolution by 1,200 times, meaning the designs we can create are not just novelties, but can be used for real applications. In the future, we may explore functional materials, such as conductive or magnetic inks, that could allow for machines and other functional devices.”
Narumi and team hope this innovation can find use in various fields such as fashion, where material wastage is often high, especially in areas where bespoke designs are sought after. But given the pre-folded shapes are entirely flat, there’s also scope for this to be useful in any situation where there are tight logistical or storage concerns. Printed designs could even be posted, and the recipient could then heat them to turn them into the thing they ordered. And there could even be a use in the area of disaster recovery, where certain items, possibly including medical items, are needed but are often difficult to transport, and it becomes a lot easier when the items required are essentially flat.

The economic life of cells,"Predicting cellular metabolic states is a central problem in biophysics. Conventional approaches, however, sensitively depend on the microscopic details of individual metabolic systems. In this Letter, we derived a universal linear relationship between the metabolic responses against nutrient conditions and metabolic inhibition, with the aid of a microeconomic theory. The relationship holds in arbitrary metabolic systems as long as the law of mass conservation stands, as supported by extensive numerical calculations. It offers quantitative predictions without prior knowledge of systems. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.028401 © 2023 American Physical Society Jumpei F. YamagishiandTetsuhiro S.

The researchers noticed a similarity between consumers’ shopping behavior and the behavior of metabolic systems, which convert food into energy in our bodies. The team focused on predicting how different metabolic systems might respond to environmental change by using an economic tool called the Slutsky equation. Their calculations indicated that very different metabolic systems actually share previously unknown universal properties, and can be understood using tools from other academic fields. Metabolic processes are used in drug development, bioengineering, food production and other industries, so being able to predict how such systems will respond to change can offer many benefits.
Where do you get your energy from? Perhaps a long night’s sleep, or a good breakfast and some exercise? These activities can all help as they support a healthy metabolism, the chemical processes by which our bodies convert food and drink into energy. Understanding how individual metabolic reactions behave and predicting how they may change under different circumstances is a big challenge. There are thousands of different reactions which enable us to move, think, grow — in short, to live. In recent years, it has become possible to predict some reactions through numerical simulations, but this requires large amounts of data. However, researchers at the University of Tokyo have derived previously unknown universal properties of metabolic systems by applying microeconomic theory to their data.
“Until this research, we thought that metabolic systems varied so much among species and cell types that there were no common properties among them,” explained Assistant Professor Tetsuhiro Hatakeyama from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “However, we were very excited to demonstrate that all metabolic systems have universal properties, and that these properties can be expressed by very simple laws.” According to the researchers, this theory does not require as much detailed background data to be collected as other methods. It can also be effectively applied whether you are trying to understand the behavior of all metabolic processes in a cell or focusing on just one part — say, for example, how much oxygen it is using.
Hatakeyama, a biophysicist, was looking at some metabolic system diagrams when he noticed a striking similarity to diagrams used in economics. This realization inspired him to try an interdisciplinary approach and apply economic theory, which he had briefly studied, to his biology research. Along with co-author Jumpei Yamagishi, a graduate student in the same lab, he decided to explore how both consumers and cells optimize their “spending” to maximize gain: Whereas we as consumers spend money, cells “spend” nutrients. They reasoned if there were similarities in this way, then perhaps the same theories that are used to identify patterns in consumer behavior under changing financial situations could also identify patterns in cellular metabolic behavior under changing environments.
More specifically, the researchers focused on the Slutsky equation, which is used to understand changes in consumer demand. In particular, it is used to understand so-called Giffen goods, which counterintuitively go up in demand when the price increases and go down in demand when the price decreases. According to Hatakeyama, this is similar to cellular metabolic behavior in response to a disturbance. For example, respiration demand (the Giffen goods in this case) in cancer cells goes up, counterintuitively, with increased drug dosage (the “price”), even though this is not beneficial to the growth rate of the cancer. The outcome was that the team uncovered a universal law for how metabolic systems respond to change.
One of the key benefits of this law is that it can be used to understand metabolic systems about which few details are known. “Disturbances in metabolic systems lead to a variety of diseases, and our research could be used to propose new treatment strategies for diseases for which treatments are not fully understood,” said Hatakeyama. “In addition, many foods and medicines are made using the metabolic systems of organisms. By applying the simple equation found in this study, we can know how to increase the output of products made with these systems.” Hatakeyama hopes that through further interdisciplinary research, more universal laws might be discovered that will lead to a variety of useful applications.

Such sensory modulation is especially critical in a threatening situation, in which animals often promote aversive responses to, among others, visual stimuli. Recently, threatened Drosophila has been shown to exhibit a defensive internal state. Whether and how threatened Drosophila promotes visual aversion, however, remains elusive. Here we report that mechanical threats to Drosophila transiently gate aversion from an otherwise neutral visual object. We further identified the neuropeptide tachykinin, and a single cluster of neurons expressing it (“Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons”), that are responsible for gating visual aversion. Calcium imaging analysis revealed that mechanical threats are encoded in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons as elevated activity. Remarkably, we also discovered that a visual object is encoded in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons as θ oscillation, which is causally linked to visual aversion. Our data reveal how a single cluster of neurons adapt organismal sensory response to a threatening situation through a neuropeptide and a combination of rate/temporal coding schemes. The capability of adapting sensory responses to an ever-changing environment, especially when the situation is threatening, is crucial for survival. Threatened animals not only show escape responses and cardiac reactions1,2,3,4,5, but also drastically modulate a wide variety of sensory responses including nociception6, audition7, and vision8,9,10,11. Of these, vision provides the richest source of information for diurnal animals about the external world, and hence its modulation in a threatening situation likely plays a vital role. Indeed, it has widely been documented that threat often acts to promote visual aversion8,9,10,11. Animal studies have partially revealed neuronal mechanisms by which threat promotes visual aversion. In fish, for instance, sound pip that itself evokes a startle response also enhances a startle response to a visual loom8. This regulation may be achieved by the excitatory convergence of mechanical and visual inputs downstream of the optic tectum8,12. In addition to excitatory convergence, visual circuits such as the primary visual cortex13, lateral geniculate nucleus14,15, superior colliculus16and even retinal cells16or equivalent of them17,18are known to be under the strong influence of neuromodulation19,20. However, how threat might regulate visual responses – specifically, the brain structure regulated by threat and the molecular, possibly neuromodulatory, mechanism of such regulation – remains so far largely unknown. Drosophila offers an attractive model in tackling these problems. First, flies are equipped with a sophisticated and well-studied visual system that in many ways parallels with that of mammals in terms of anatomy and behaviors it elicits21,22,23,24,25,26. It is also under the influence of a rich repertoire of modulation20. One of the best known examples is the effect of locomotion27,28,29,30conserved across species31,32, but others include the effects of food odor17and sexual arousal18. While known forms of visual neuromodulation are based on a functional equivalent of noradrenaline named octopamine17,29,33, Drosophila harbors many more evolutionarily conserved neuromodulators34. Last, threatened Drosophila exhibits signs of a threat-induced internal state. Specifically, flies exposed to visual threats show running, jumping, freezing, and suppression of feeding35. Similarly, flies exposed to a series of air puffs increase locomotion and olfactory startle response, with the locomotion being regulated by Dop1R136. In addition, flies presented with a visual loom show bradycardia with freezing and tachycardia with flight responses5. Such existing knowledge led us to hypothesize that threat might promote visual aversion through a neuromodulatory mechanism in Drosophila, which would provide an appealing opportunity to dissect the underlying molecular and neuronal mechanisms. Here we report that air puffs, which we confirmed to elicit signs of an internal state in Drosophila, transiently gate aversion from an otherwise neutral, small visual object. We further identified the neuropeptide tachykinin, and a single cluster of neurons expressing it (“Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons”), that are responsible for gating visual aversion. Calcium imaging experiments revealed that Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons encode the air puffs as increased activity. Unexpectedly, we discovered that these neurons encode a visual object as increased θ oscillation only when air puffs are given beforehand, which is causally linked to visual aversion. Altogether, our data identify Tk and a cluster of Tk-expressing neurons that gate visual aversion in threatened Drosophila, and illustrate the coding schemes therein to adapt organismal sensory responses to a threatening situation. For Drosophila, a small visual object could signal the presence of either a potential mate or a distant predator, and hence its ethological value presumably depends on the context. Consistently, a small object usually induces no response37or only mild aversion38, but induces attraction when combined with food odor17or sexual arousal18. We thus hypothesized that aversion from a small object is promoted in a threatening situation. To test this possibility, we took advantage of a walking simulator in which it is easy to present air puffs as mechanical threats and a visual object at a location and a timing of our choosing (Fig.1a). Since previous studies reported increased locomotion as one of the primary manifestations of a threat-induced internal state35,36, we first sought to confirm that air puffs indeed increase locomotion in our paradigm (Fig.1b). When we estimated the fly’s walking velocity through the ball’s movement (Fig.1a), we found that the fly’s walking velocity instantaneously increased upon air puffs (500 ms puff at 1 Hz for 10 times), which then gradually returned to the baseline (Supplementary Fig.1a), consistent with the previous report36. Also consistently36, increasing the number of puffs tended to increase the maximum walking velocity (Supplementary Fig.1b). To better characterize the puff-induced behavioral changes, we quantified grooming, stopping, proboscis extension reflex (PER), and walking behaviors with our custom-written convolutional neural network software (Fig.1c, Supplementary Fig.1c; see Online Methods). This analysis revealed that grooming and stopping dominated before air puffs (Fig.1d, upper panel). After puffs, however, these behaviors were taken over by walking (Fig.1d, lower panel), especially during the initial 5 s (Fig.1d, blue bar above the upper panel). This observation was echoed when we quantified the probability of each behavior during the initial 5 s of the recordings (Fig.1e), along with their per-fly differences between puff - and puff + trials (Fig.1f). Moreover, in the closed-loop experiment in which air puffs were applied only when the fly was heading in certain directions, flies clearly avoided heading in the “puff-ON” directions (Supplementary Fig.1d-f). These observations reinforce the idea that air puffs serve as mechanical threats to flies25. aA schematic illustration of an LED arena.bTime course of the experiment.cAnalyzed behaviors (grooming, proboscis extension reflex (PER), stopping, and walking).dEthogram representing the time course of behaviors.

Statistics are identical to those ine.gA schematic of the experiment. A small visual object was displayed on a set of LED matrices surrounding the fly. The fly’s walking speed and linear direction alongx-axis were continuously monitored and were reflected on the visual object’s angular position. This schematic illustrates how the fly’s left-ward walking results in the right-ward shift in the visual objects’ angular position.hTime course of the experiment.iExample time course of the visual object’s angular position.

We next tested whether air puffs gate visual aversion. To this end, we confronted the fly with a small visual object, initially 60 degrees right or left to the fly at random, that shifts its position according to the fly’s walking pattern (closed-loop) (Fig.1g). A single trial consisted of 90 s of interval, 10 s of air puffs, and 5 s of recording, and was repeated for each fly 10 times with or without air puffs at random (Fig.1h). When we tracked the position of a visual object as the fly walked without preceding puffs, directed walking toward or away from the visual object was not evident (Fig.1i, black line; Supplementary Movie1). In stark contrast, when a small object was presented following air puffs, flies clearly shifted the visual object to the fly’s back (Fig.1i, red line; Supplementary Movie1). This effect, however, may simply be because increased locomotion amplifies the aversion which is too weak to detect without preceding puffs. To address this issue, we calculated the avoidance index, as defined by the linear distance travelled away from the object, divided by the total linear distance travelled (see Online Methods). This index increased following the air puffs (Fig.1j), suggesting that the gated aversion is unaffected by increased locomotion. Since the effect of air puffs was clearly summarized as positive per-fly changes in visual aversion (Fig.1k), the following data are presented in this format. Gated visual aversion was not affected by repeated trials (Supplementary Fig.1g) nor sex-dependent at a statistically significant level (Supplementary Fig.1h), persisted for up to 6 s but no longer than 10 s (Supplementary Fig.1i), and required more than 5 puffs to manifest (Supplementary Fig.1j). We thus established that air puffs serve as mechanical threats for Drosophila to gate aversion from a small visual object. To probe the molecular mechanism underlying the puff-gated visual aversion, we screened a set of CRISPR-generated neuropeptide null mutants39. This identified a few lines, the most prominent of which was the mutant line of Tachykinin (Tk), which failed to gate visual aversion while increasing the locomotion (Supplementary Data1). To further validate the necessity of Tk, we tested additional null mutations (ΔTk1andΔTk2) reported previously40. As expected, puff-gated visual aversion was suppressed in homozygous mutants ofΔTk1(ΔTk1/ΔTk1) andΔTk2(ΔTk2/ΔTk2), as well as their trans-heterozygotes (ΔTk1/ΔTk2) (Fig.2a, b), further supporting the role of Tk in gating visual aversion. Interestingly, increased locomotion upon air puffs did not significantly differ between wild-type and these mutants (Fig.2c), indicating that Tk is specifically required for gating visual aversion but not for increased locomotion. Tk mutants showed optomotor response (Supplementary Fig.2a-c) and aversion from air puffs (Supplementary Fig.2d, e) to the extent comparable to those of the wild-type flies, suggesting that these mutants retain basic visual/motor functions. To obtain further evidence that Tk is required for gating visual aversion, we tested mutants of Tk receptors. In the fly genome, Takr86C41and Takr99D42have been identified. We thus tested a putative loss-of-function insertional mutation in Takr99D43and a loss-of-function deletional mutation in Takr86C40. Puff-gated visual aversion was suppressed in Takr86C mutant (Fig.2d, e), phenocopying the Tk mutations (Fig.2a, b). Similar tendency was observed for Takr99D mutant, but not at a statistically significant level (Fig.2a, b). Also consistent with the phenotype of Tk mutations (Fig.2c), both Takr mutants did show increased locomotion (Fig.2f). These data corroborate the idea that Tk is specifically required for gating visual aversion but not for increased locomotion. aExample time course of the visual object’s angular position for wild-type andΔTk(ΔTk1andΔTk2) homo- and trans-heterozygous mutants.

We next sought to identify the Tk-expressing neurons responsible for gating visual aversion. To this end, we expressed the tetanus toxin (TNT) using GAL4 drivers under the control of different Tk promoters, with each leading to partially overlapping but different expression patterns44(Fig.3a). We found that puff-gated visual aversion was suppressed in flies in which TNT was expressed by one of these drivers (Tk-GAL42) but not the other drivers, suggesting that this line labels the responsible neurons (Fig.3b, c; Supplementary Fig.3a). Expressing EGFP and RedStinger (nuclear RFP) with Tk-GAL42labeled a collection of approximately 50 neurons dispersed throughout the brain (Supplementary Fig.3b). Suppression of Tk-GAL42neurons failed to disrupt the increased locomotion (Fig.3d; Supplementary Fig.3c), suggesting that Tk-GAL42neurons are required for gated visual aversion but not for increased locomotion. Driving Tk RNAi by Tk-GAL42resulted in the tendency to suppress puff-gated visual aversion but not quite reaching statistical significance, possibly due to insufficient efficiency (Supplementary Fig.3d). Next, we asked whether artificial activation of these neurons can substitute for air puffs. To this end, we activated Tk-GAL42neurons by shining light on the head of the fly expressing the light-gated cation channel CsChrimson (Fig.3e). A single trial consisted of 90 s of interval, 10 s of photoactivation, and 5 s of recording (visual object was presented soon after the photoactivation ended), and was repeated for each fly 6 times with or without shining light at random. Indeed, photoactivation of Tk-GAL42neurons alone gated visual aversion (Fig.3f, upper two panels). This observation was echoed when we calculated the difference in the avoidance indices between light + trials and light - trials (Fig.3g, left two plots). Importantly, this activation effect failed to manifest in the Tk-KO background (Fig.3f, the bottom panel; Fig.3g, the right plot), suggesting that photoactivation of Tk-GAL42neurons gated visual aversion via Tk. Consistent with the data of Tk mutants (Fig.2) and suppression of Tk-GAL42neurons (Fig.3a-d), photoactivation of Tk-GAL42neurons failed to increase locomotion at a statistically significant level (Fig.3h). These data collectively suggest that Tk-GAL42neurons are necessary and sufficient for gating visual aversion but not for increased locomotion, and that these neurons exert such a function via Tk. aBrains of Tk-GAL41> mCD8::GFP, Tk-GAL42> mCD8::GFP, and Tk-GAL43> mCD8::GFP (green) immunostained with anti-neuropil marker nc82 (blue).

We further sought to narrow down the subset of Tk-GAL42neurons that is responsible for gating visual aversion. A growing body of evidence suggests that neuropeptidergic neurons typically co-express one or more additional small neurotransmitters, including Tk-expressing neurons in the Drosophila brain45. We thus reasoned that combining Tk-GAL42with a GAL4 suppressor GAL8046, driven by markers of small neurotransmitters (Fig.4a), may label different subsets of Tk-GAL42neurons. Indeed, this strategy resulted in the labelling of partially overlapping but distinct subpopulations of Tk-GAL42neurons (Fig.4b). Most notably, GAL80 driven by a marker for glutamatergic neurons (VGluT), but not markers for cholinergic (ChAT) or GABAergic (Gad1) neurons, suppressed labeling of a cluster of neurons in the superior medial protocerebrum (Fig.4b, white arrowheads in the inlets indicate cell bodies). Remarkably, VGluT-GAL80 restored the puff-gated visual aversion disrupted by Tk-GAL42-driven TNT (Fig.4c, d), suggesting that VGluT-GAL80 labels a subset of Tk-GAL42neurons responsible for gating visual aversion. VGluT-GAL80 by itself failed to influence puff-gated visual aversion, as flies carrying VGluT-GAL80 in addition to either Tk-GAL42or UAS-TNT exhibited puff-gated visual aversion comparable to flies carrying either Tk-GAL42or UAS-TNT alone (Supplementary Fig.4a). All test groups showed increased locomotion comparable to that of the control group (Supplementary Fig.4b), corroborating our earlier finding (Fig.3d, h) that Tk-GAL42neurons are dispensable for puff-increased locomotion. aA schematic diagram of combining Tk-GAL42and X-GAL80 to restrict the expression of GAL4.bA brain of Tk-GAL42> mCD8::GFP (green), and brains of Tk-GAL42> mCD8::GFP (green) combined with VGluT-GAL80, ChAT-GAL80, and Gad1-GAL80, respectively.

In order to more directly probe the function of VGluT+subset of Tk-GAL42neurons, we next took advantage of the intersectional strategy47in which the GAL4/ UAS binary system was combined with the Flippase (FLP) recombination technique. With this strategy, we aimed to restrict the expression of TNT to the cells in which both Tk-GAL42and VGluT-FLP are active (Fig.4e, green area). Immunohistochemistry revealed that the intersection of Tk-GAL42and VGluT indeed labels a single cluster of 20-30 neurons in the superior medial protocerebrum (Fig.4f, white arrowheads in the inlet indicate cell bodies), a pattern complementary to that of the combination of Tk-GAL42and VGluT-GAL80 (Fig.4b). Hereafter, we designate these neurons as Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons. Immunohistochemistry of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons in females revealed distinct but partially overlapping neurite morphology compared to males (Supplementary Fig.4c). To examine whether Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons are required for puff-gated visual aversion, we next expressed TNT in these neurons. This manipulation suppressed puff-gated visual aversion compared with control groups (Fig.4g, h), suggesting that Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons are required for gating visual aversion. Next, since artificial induction of Tk-GAL42neurons substituted for the air puffs in gating visual aversion (Fig.3e–g), we expected to obtain a similar result for Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons. Indeed, when we photoactivated the Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons expressing CsChrimson in the same manner as in Fig.3e–g(Fig.4i, j), visual aversion was gated in a retinal-fed group but not in a retinal-unfed control group (Fig.4k, l). Photoactivation of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons failed to increase locomotion at a statistically significant level (Supplementary Fig.4e), suggesting the specific role of these neurons in gating visual aversion. Varying the photoactivation frequency failed to influence the photoactivation effect on visual aversion or locomotion at statistically significant levels (Supplementary Fig.4f, g), suggesting that increased activity in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons but not the temporal pattern promotes visual aversion. Thus, photoactivation of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons overall phenocopied photoactivation of Tk-GAL42neurons (Fig.3e–g). Collectively, our data suggest that the activation of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons is causally related to the puff-gated visual aversion, but is not causally related to increased locomotion (Fig.4m). We next asked whether and how Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons encode air puffs and a visual object (Fig.5a). To this end, we imaged activity of Tk-GAL42neurons expressing GCaMP7f in a tethered fly, while presenting air puffs and a visual object (Fig.5b). To record the neuronal response to either a visual object alone, air puffs alone, or air puffs followed by a visual object, we tested these three conditions with intervals for the same fly (Fig.5c). This experiment revealed that Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons exhibit a calcium elevation upon air puffs (Fig.5d; Supplementary Movie2). More specifically, the GCaMP signal kept rising while air puffs were repeatedly applied (Fig.5e, red-shaded time windows (30-40 s and 50-60 s)), began to decline when puff application ceased, and returned to the baseline in approximately 10 s (Fig.5e, 40-50 s). Our recording captured signals from Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons alone, as evidenced by the lack of baseline fluorescence in our region-of-interest when VGluT-GAL80 was additionally expressed (Supplementary Fig.5a). In contrast to air puffs, we failed to detect changes in the GCaMP signal in response to a visual object with or without preceding air puffs (Fig.5e, blue-shaded time windows). When GCaMP signals were transformed into z-scores and averaged over the time windows for air puffs or a visual object (Fig.5f), we observed an increase in the z-score by approximately 1.3 during air puffs (Fig.5f, left), while we failed to observe such increase during the presentation of a visual object (Fig.5f, right). Calcium elevation upon air puffs was also observed in females (Supplementary Fig.5b, c). Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons thus appear to encode air puffs in the form of calcium elevation but not a visual object. The puff response was heterogeneous within Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons, with each neuron showing distinct response dynamics in a reproducible manner (Supplementary Fig.5d). Furthermore, a subpopulation (~36%) of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons failed to exhibit a calcium elevation upon air puffs (Supplementary Fig.5e), without obvious spatial localization pattern stereotyped across flies (Supplementary Fig.5f). aA schematic of the hypothesis.

We next wondered from where the information of air puffs is transmitted to Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons. Since wind is sensed in part by the a3 segment of the antennae48, we hypothesized that disrupting the antennae function may block the response of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons to air puffs. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted the function of a3 by either surgical removal or gluing (Fig.5g), and imaged the calcium dynamics in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons while delivering air puffs. Indeed, disruption of a3 markedly reduced the calcium elevation in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons (Fig.5h). Further quantification revealed that disruption of a3 reduced the maximum GCaMP signals during air puffs by approximately 60% (Fig.5i). Since we have already established a causal link between Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons and gated visual aversion (Fig.4), reduction in the puff response of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons should lead to a decrease in gated visual aversion. In line with this reasoning, surgical removal of a3 segments suppressed the puff-gated visual aversion (Fig.5j, k). These data indicate that air puffs activate Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons via the a3 segments of the antennae to gate visual aversion. Our data so far have demonstrated that air puffs but not a visual object increase the activity of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons to gate visual aversion (Fig.5e, f). How, then, is increased activity of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons translated into visual aversion? Multiple information can be encoded, for example in the hippocampus, as the firing rate and the temporal pattern of firing that heavily depends on oscillatory activities49. This example motivated us to test whether air puffs allow Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons to encode a visual object as oscillatory activity. We first validated that our calcium imaging setup can detect oscillatory activities of at least up to 25 Hz (Supplementary Fig.6a). Strikingly, when we analyzed the power spectra of the calcium imaging data presented in Fig.5, we discovered that the power of θ (4–8 Hz) and α (8–16 Hz) oscillations transiently increased specifically when a visual object was presented following, but not before, air puffs (Fig.6a). We ruled out the possibility that such oscillatory activities occurred simply because air puffs were repeatedly presented, by additionally performing the calcium imaging experiments while presenting air puffs/ a visual object in a reverse order, which yielded a similar result (Supplementary Fig.6b). Quantification of the changes in power from preceding 0.5 s time bin (Fig.6b–e) confirmed that θ/ α oscillations transiently increased when a visual object was presented following air puffs (Fig.6c, d). Air puffs per se also slightly increased θ/ α oscillations, but significantly to lesser degrees (Fig.6c, d). On the other hand, β oscillations slightly increased in response to air puffs per se, while δ oscillations failed to show stimulus specificity (Fig.6b, e). We observed similar tendencies irrespective of the stimulation schedule (“forward” schedule as illustrated in Fig.5cand its “reverse” schedule in Supplementary Fig.6c–j). As θ/ α but not δ/ β oscillations appear to be correlated with the visual aversion, these data suggest that θ and/or α oscillations may be causally related to visual aversion. Interestingly, increased θ oscillation in response to a visual object was specific to the cells activated by air puffs (Supplementary Fig.6k). This observation hints at the possibility that the fraction of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons which encodes both air puffs and a visual object may be responsible for puff-gated visual aversion. aAverage wavelet cross-spectrum of the neural recordings.

Scale bar: 15 um. We next sought to test whether θ/α oscillations in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons causally contribute to visual aversion. If this is the case, photoactivating Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons with θ/α frequencies while presenting a visual object, without preceding air puffs, should promote visual aversion more efficiently than other frequencies (Fig.6f, left). Note this experiment differs from those of Fig.3e-hand Fig.4: there, we photoactivated neurons labeled by Tk-Gal42(Fig.3e-h) or Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons (Fig.4) before presenting a visual object to mimic the calcium elevation that occurs in response to air puffs; in contrast, in this experiment we photoactivated Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons during the presentation of a visual object, to mimic θ/α oscillations that occur in response to a visual object. To this end, we photoactivated Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons with different frequencies, while presenting a small visual object without preceding air puffs (Fig.6f, right). Remarkably, despite that we kept the total amount of delivered photons constant across different frequencies (see Online Methods), photoactivation with a frequency matching θ (6 Hz) most effectively gated visual aversion (Fig.6g, h; Supplementary Movie3). In contrast, photoactivation of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons with other frequencies failed to gate visual aversion at statistically significant levels (Fig.6g, h; Supplementary Movie3). Theta is therefore more likely than other frequencies to causally contribute to visual aversion. Is θ oscillation, then, necessary for puff-gated visual aversion? Previous studies have successfully suppressed an oscillatory activity by artificially inducing oscillation of irrelevant frequencies50,51,52. We thus sought to test if forced induction of frequencies other than θ, during visual stimulus, suppresses puff-gated visual aversion (Fig.6i, left). To this end, we applied air puffs to the fly, and then presented a visual object while photoinducing different frequencies in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons (Fig.6i, right). Indeed, photoinduction of all but θ frequency (6 Hz) suppressed the puff-gated visual aversion (Fig.6j). Our data hence suggest a causal link between visually-evoked θ oscillation and puff-gated visual aversion. Overall, we propose a model of the neuronal mechanism underlying puff-gated visual aversion as follows (Fig.6k): without air puffs, visual information is fed into Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons but fails to induce a response; in contrast, air puffs induce a calcium elevation in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons, allowing them to increase θ oscillation upon subsequent visual information, which at least in part contributes to visual aversion. We next wondered whether gating of θ oscillation and resultant visual aversion are specific to a small object, or instead are induced by other visual objects as well. Flies are widely known to be attracted to a dark vertical bar, which is often referred to as bar fixation53,54. We thus examined whether air puffs influence bar fixation, with essentially the same experimental schedule as in Fig.1hexcept that a vertical bar was presented instead of a small object (Fig.7a). As previously reported, flies fixated on a vertical bar before receiving air puffs (Fig.7b, black line; Supplementary Movie4). Likewise, when the bar was presented following air puffs, flies showed fixation (Fig.7b, red line; Supplementary Movie4). Bar fixation index, which is the inverse of avoidance index, also showed robust attraction with or without air puffs (Fig.7c). This observation suggests that, in contrast to the response to a small object, air puffs fail to influence bar fixation at a statistically significant level. aTime course of the experiment.

Given the causal relationship between θ oscillation and visual aversion, we predicted that a vertical bar would fail to evoke θ oscillation. To test this prediction, we performed a calcium imaging experiment as in Fig.6, this time presenting a vertical bar instead of a small object. This experiment revealed that a vertical bar indeed fails to evoke θ oscillation even following air puffs (Fig.7d). Quantification of the changes in power from preceding 0.5 s time bin confirmed that θ oscillation failed to show a larger increase when a vertical bar was presented following air puffs as compared to when a vertical bar alone or air puffs alone were presented (Fig.7e). This observation is consistent with our data that air puffs fail to gate aversion from a vertical bar at a statistically significant level (Fig.7a-c). Having thus established that gating of θ oscillation and the resultant visual aversion take place in response to a small object but not to a vertical bar, we next asked whether forced induction of θ oscillation can aversively bias bar fixation (Fig.7f, left). To this end, we optogenetically induced θ oscillation while presenting a vertical bar, and recorded the fly’s behavior (Fig.7f, right). Remarkably, photoactivation with a frequency matching θ aversively biased the bar fixation in the retinal-fed test group (Fig.7g, h), while frequencies other than θ (6 Hz) in the retinal-fed test group failed to do so at statistically significant levels (Fig.7g, h). Statistically insignificant reduction in bar fixation observed across different frequencies in the retinal-unfed control group (Fig.7h) may be attributed to the red light not entirely undetectable to the fly55. Together, our data suggest that even bar fixation, which is unaffected by air puffs, can be aversively biased by artificial θ activity in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons. Altogether, the present study shows that threatened Drosophila gates visual aversion through Tk and a single cluster of Tk-expressing neurons. Our data illustrates how mechanical threats and a visual object can be encoded in the same set of neurons to adapt organismal visual response to a threatening situation. Here we have revealed that air puffs to fruit flies not only increase locomotion, induce aversion from air puffs, but gate aversion from an otherwise neutral visual object. A single cluster of neurons expressing the neuropeptide Tk is necessary and sufficient for gated visual aversion. A majority of these Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons exhibit a calcium elevation upon air puffs. Strikingly, air puffs gate visual response of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons at least in part in the form of θ oscillation, which is causally linked to visual aversion. Collectively, our data suggest a neuronal mechanism in which Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons encode both mechanical threats and a visual object to elicit behavioral aversion. In the present study, we observed that air puffs increase locomotion (Fig.1a-f, Supplementary Fig.1a), induce aversion from air puffs (Supplementary Fig.1d-f), and gate visual aversion (Fig.1g-k). We further discovered that Tk and Takr null mutations consistently reduce puff-gated visual aversion (Fig.2), and that suppression / photoactivation of Tk+neurons reduces / phenocopies puff-gated visual aversion, the latter of which is blocked by Tk null mutations (Fig.3e-h). In addition, we showed that suppression / activation of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons reduces / phenocopies puff-gated visual aversion (Fig.4g, h, k, l), although whether the latter is mediated by secretion of Tk molecules remains to be tested. While Tk-GAL42driver not only labels Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons but a group of aggression-inducing neurons40, it is unlikely that these neurons contribute to gating visual aversion, because these neurons are located more laterally than Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons (Fig.4f), and are additionally labelled by Tk-GAL41driver40which appears irrelevant for gated visual aversion (Fig.3b, c). In addition, unlike aggression-inducing Tk neurons being male-specific40, Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons exist also in female (Supplementary Fig.4c), are activated by air puffs (Supplementary Fig.5b, c), and puff-gated visual avoidance mediated by these neurons in male is also observed in female (Supplementary Fig.1h), suggesting that the function of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons is largely sex-independent. Compared to male, however, neurite morphology of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons is partially different (Supplementary Fig.4c) and visual avoidance tended to be slightly weaker (Supplementary Fig.1h) in female. We therefore do not exclude the possibility that some additional sex-specific regulations may be at work. While air puffs have historically been used by experimenters as a means to promote locomotion29,33, puff responses that we observed in the present study resemble the characteristics of threat responses in mammals56, which manifests itself as similar behavioral1,2,3,4and cognitive57,58components. Such similarities hint at the possibility that air puffs, serving as mechanical threats, induce a threat-induced internal state in Drosophila. Indeed, a previous literature has suggested that the mechanically increased locomotion may represent an internal state, even with a negative “affective valence”, in Drosophila36, on the ground that mechanical threats increase locomotion with scalability and persistence36, olfactory sensitization36, and release of an odorant that repels other flies59. It is notable that the “defensive internal state” has been explicitly reported in Drosophila in the context of repeated overhead shadows35. Air puffs to Drosophila may thus serve as a model to gain insight into the neuronal mechanisms underlying threat-induced internal state. Tk has previously been implicated in nociception60,61, anxiety62, chronic stress responses63,64,65,66, metabolic stress67, locomotion68, and more recently aggression40,69,70. Ever since the insect homolog of Tk was first identified in locust71,72, evolutionary conservation of Tk functions has been pointed out at least in aggression40and nociception61. While the role of Tk molecules in puff-gated visual aversion, specifically whether and how it mediates the function of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons, needs further validation, its role in threat-gated visual aversion may also turn out to be evolutionarily conserved. How might Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons communicate with the visual circuitry to regulate visual aversion? Interestingly, Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons (Fig.4f) appear to send neurites to AOTU, an optic glomeruli directly innervated by two types of visual projection neurons (VPNs), LC10 and MC6126,73,74. Of these, LC10 selectively responds to a small visual object75. One possibility therefore is that LC10 neurons and Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons establish a direct connection in AOTU, although other VPNs that respond to a small object but not to a vertical bar23,76may indirectly communicate with Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons. Interestingly, LC10a is indirectly gated by the male sexual arousal center comprised of P1 neurons via yet unidentified circuitry18,77. It would be interesting in the future to test whether and how Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons communicate with LC10 and how such communication compares to P1-LC10 communication. Such insights may further our general understanding of how visual system is recruited and modulated by different internal states. In the present study, we revealed that air puffs evoke a calcium elevation in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons (Fig.5). This activation is largely mediated by antennae (Fig.5g-k) at least when the puffs are applied frontally. Given that antennae fully account for wind-induced stopping irrespective of the wind direction48, antennae may similarly play a major role in the regulation of visual aversion irrespective of the puff direction, but other mechanosensory systems78may be recruited when puffs are applied from the side or back of the fly. Since substituting air puffs by photoactivation with varying frequencies increased visual aversion with similar degrees (Supplementary Fig.4f, g), Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons likely employ a rate coding scheme to encode air puffs. In contrast, we discovered that Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons employ a temporal coding scheme to encode visual information. Specifically, we found that Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons, when air puffs are applied beforehand, increase the power of θ oscillation in response to a visual object, and that the increased θ causally contributes to visual aversion (Fig.6, Fig.7; Supplementary Fig.6). We additionally observed that air puffs fail to influence bar fixation at a statistically significant level, that the bar fails to evoke θ oscillation in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons, and that artificial θ oscillation in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons can aversively bias bar fixation (Fig.7). These observation suggest that the θ oscillation in Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons is capable of assigning aversive value to a range of visual information, hinting that these neurons may more widely contribute to the value coding of the visual information. How might θ activity gate visual aversion? Since neurons are particularly sensitive to high temporal densities of spike input, synchronized outputs from sender neurons may better communicate to their receiver neurons79. Alternatively, the flow of information from Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons to their downstream target may be improved by increased coherence between the two populations, an idea put forth by “communication through coherence” theory80,81. Identification of the downstream target of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons would resolve this issue. Interestingly, θ oscillation in amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to play roles in mammalian fear82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91and vision92,93,94,95. However, such hypotheses have so far been supported by mostly correlational studies. Accordingly, whether and how θ oscillation elicits fear- or vision- related behaviors remain largely unknown. The present study demonstrates a causal link between θ oscillation and visual aversion, and genetically identifies Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons wherein θ oscillation subserves such a function. Whether θ oscillation in Drosophila subserves similar functions as that in mammals remains an important issue to be resolved in the future, but our paradigm may prove to be a useful model to gain insights into how θ oscillation generally regulates a threat-induced internal state and vision to shape behavior. Overall, we have discovered a group of Tk-expressing neurons that gate visual aversion but not increased locomotion. We further revealed how mechanical threats and a visual object can be encoded therein by a combination of rate and temporal coding schemes. Because functions of Tk and θ oscillation appear to be highly conserved across animal kingdom, their roles in visual aversion we describe here may also hold true in other animal species. We propose our findings open up an exciting avenue to the interrogation of how threat promotes visual aversion.

Flies were maintained on conventional cornmeal-agar-molasses medium under a 9AM:9PM light/ dark cycle at 25 °C and 60 + /− 5% humidity. Flies were collected 0–2 days post eclosion and housed in a group of 9–10 for 2–7 days before testing (except for calcium imaging and optogenetics experiments, in which flies were housed in a group of 4–6). All behavioral experiments were carried out between 2 pm and 9 pm at 25 + /− 0.8 C and 60 + /− 5% humidity. Immediately before the experiments, flies were briefly (<1 min) cold anesthetized, and their thorax was glued to the rounded tip of a needle with UV bonding glue (Bondic BD-SKCJ) and 405 nm UV light (OSV5XME1C1E, Akizuki electronics. Inc). For each fly, the experiment lasted approximately 45 min and was split into 10 trials unless otherwise stated. Behavioral experiments for each fly consisted of acclimation (17 min), calibration (3 min), and visual response tests (25 min), in this order. For each fly, ball tracking record during calibration phase was used to estimate the mean L-R asymmetry per frame. This estimate was used in the following trials throughout to correct for the L-R asymmetry. During visual response tests, mechanical stimulation (given or not) in one trial was chosen in a pseudo-random order so each condition be repeated for 5 times, resulting in the total of 2 × 5 = 10 trials. Inter-trial interval was set to 90 s. A uniform background (80 cd/m2) was given throughout the experiment. As for CRISPR screening (Supplementary Data1), each condition was repeated 3 times; as for optogenetics experiments, each stimulation frequency was repeated twice. The LED arena consisted of an air-supported foam ball (Yuzawaya, Japan) in a sphere holder. The ball had a diameter of 8 mm. The airflow was constantly monitored with a digital flowmeter (MF-FP10N-H06-010, Horiba estec. Inc) and was adjusted to 500 + /− 10 mL/min. A pair of 850 nm IR LEDs (FRS5CS, Akizuki electronics. Inc) illuminated the fly from the back. A laser tracking sensor isolated from a computer mouse (MA-LSMA4BK, SANWA) was placed behind the ball in the back of the fly. Tracking data were read out by a computer online at ~192 Hz. This allowed online calculation of the instantaneous rotation of the ball. A video camera (MSP-3080, Panrico) was situated above the fly to record behavior at 47 Hz. The video recordings were analyzed offline by AI-based custom python program (elaborated below). Six LED matrices (Medium 16 × 32 RGB LED matrix panel 420, Adafruit) with > 120fps (confirmed by videotaping the matrices with a high-speed camera) surrounded the fly, covering almost the whole visual field of the fly (azimuth, + /− 135°; elevation, + /− 57°; resolution ~2.8°). The visual arena had a luminance of 80 cd m−2. The LED matrices were controlled by a custom-written python program based on rpi-rgb-led-matrix package (https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix). We showed a single black object (22.5° wide, 22.5° high, 0 cd/m2) on a green background (80 cd/m2). A visual object was placed at either −60° or +60° at random and the fly was then given control of the angular position of the object. As for induction of θ activity in Fig.6, the fly was given 30 s control of the angular position of the object, because air puffs that would increase the locomotion were not applied in this experiment and thus response to a single black object unfolded more slowly. In Fig.7, we showed a single black bar instead (22.5° wide, 57° high, 0 cd/m2) and the fly was given 30 s control of the angular position of the object, as the bar fixation unfolded relatively slowly compared to response to a small object. Mechanical stimulation was delivered through a glass pipette (tip diameter of ~2 mm), placed ~2 mm in front of the fly, connected with air hose to a compressor (SSPP-3S, Suisaku, Japan) via a solenoid valve (EXA-C6-02C-4, CKD). The solenoid valve was controlled by an Arduino Uno board configured with Arduino IDE (v.1.8.19), which in turn received connection from a desktop computer running the python program which orchestrated the LED matrices, video recording, ball tracking, and puff application. The mechanical stimulation consisted of 10 puffs (except for Supplementary Fig.1b, jin which the number of air puffs were varied without changing the frequency nor pressure) by alternating the solenoid valve in between 500 ms-open and 500 ms-closed states (1 Hz). The air pressure was measured by digital manometer (HT-1500N, Hodaka Inc.) and was adjusted to 12 kPa. Ball tracking data sampled at ~192 Hz was used to estimate the fly’s walking direction and speed. For each frame, change in the virtual x coordinate from the previous frame was calculated, and this value was multiplied by a gain factor. Gain factor was fixed across flies and experiments, and was set as the one that yielded best bar-fixation performance in a separate experiment. The raw ball-tracking data were first down-sampled (interpolated from ~192 to 10 Hz). Flies were excluded from data analysis when the average probability of walking during trials without puff application was over 25%, indicating unusually high arousal. To account for the L-R asymmetry in the tracking data, due in part to the fly not positioned perfectly perpendicular to the tracking sensor, for each fly we tracked the ball for 3 min prior to the closed-loop experiments, and estimated the average asymmetry per frame. This estimate was used in the following trials throughout to correct for the L-R asymmetry. We calculated the avoidance index to quantify the avoidance from a small visual object. This index was defined as: {(linear distance along x axis travelled away from a visual object) – (linear distance along x axis travelled toward a visual object)} / {(linear distance along x axis travelled away from a visual object) + (linear distance along x axis travelled toward a visual object)}. The linear distance along x axis was calculated through the air-supported ball’s rotation, as explained in the above paragraph (“Turn estimation and closed-loop walking”). Walk directed away from the small object tended to manifest robustly 2 s after the start of recording (Fig.1i), and so the recording of 2–5 s was used to calculate the avoidance index. Attraction index was defined as the linear distance alongx-axis travelled toward the vertical bar divided by the total distance travelled along x axis. For analysis, we rejected flies which showed avoidance index of larger than 0.4 without air puffs/photoactivation, as such high baseline visual aversion would mask the avoidance-promoting effect of air puffs/photoactivation (the percentage of rejected flies in the wild-type experiment (Fig.1) was 10%, and the percentage stayed around this value throughout the experiments in the present study). We analyzed each video offline using our custom neural network program written in python, utilizing python OpenCV package (v.4.2.0). We first cropped each video, shrinking each image from the dimension of 640 × 480 to 260 × 480 so that the fly is located at around the center of each image. A portion of these images, specifically those from wild type flies, were then manually classified into different behaviors or states (flight/ walking/ grooming/ PER/ stopping/ “stuck” (where the air-supported ball is stuck at the edge of the holder so the fly could not move)/ “freeze in air” (fly is detached from the ball and not showing noticeable movements; we rarely observed this state but when we did, it tended to be immediately after puff application)). Each category typically contained ~200 frames from different flies, except for grooming and stuck categories that each contained ~1000 frames. To take advantage of the temporal information, we then generated “mean” images so that, for an image at time t, an average image of time (t–1), t, and (t + 1) was generated, discarding the first and the last frame of each video. This strategy, compared with when we used the original frames, improved the prediction precision by ~8% as estimated by cross validation. These average images were then augmented by adding random modifications in rotation, scale, location, and flip, so that 10 ~ 50 such images were generated from each original image (rotation angles/ scales/ location shifts independently and uniformly sampled (uid) from [–10,10] degrees/ [−10,10]%/ [−10,10]%, respectively). We adjusted the number of augmented images generated from each original image, so that the total number of augmented images does not vary significantly between behavioral categories. Using these augmented images, we trained the network that contained six 3 × 3 convolutional layers and four dense layers. All but the last layer passed through a ReLu activation function and the final layer passed through a softmax function. Each layer was followed by max pooling, with the pool size of 2 × 2 and strides of 2 × 2. To prevent overfitting, dropout of rate 0.2 was implemented following the last four convolutional layers, and dropout of rate 0.3 was implemented following the first three dense layers. The network was trained using Keras with the input frames being a 119 × 150 × 3 patch. During training, the cross-entropy loss between the predicted score-map and the ground-truth score-map was minimized by stochastic gradient descent. The final model was trained with the batch size of 128 and 150 epochs, which achieved 95% of classification precision as estimated by cross validation. After training, the network predicted entire video frames, which were then thresholded so that confidence of >70% was required for the most likely behavior to be designated to a frame. We discarded trials where the labeling rate fell below 70%. We further discarded trials where “stuck” or “freeze in air” accounted for >10% of all successful labels. Also, trials where “flight” accounted for >10% of all successful labels were excluded from analyses concerning visual aversion and walking velocity. To test the role of antennae in the detection of air puffs, a3 segments were either surgically removed using a pair of forceps or glued to a2 segment with a small drop of ultraviolet-activated glue. The glue was cured with uv bonding glue (Bondic BD-SKCJ) and 405 nm uv light (OSV5XME1C1E, Akizuki electronics. Inc). Both manipulations were performed on CO2-anesthetized flies 2 days before testing. Flies that underwent CO2-anesthesia and touching of antennae with a pair of forceps 2 days before testing served as controls. Flies expressing CsChrimson, a red-shifted channelrhodopsin variant, in neurons labeled by Tk-GAL42or Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons were placed on food containing 500 µM all-trans retinal for 3 days prior to testing. Photoactivation was performed by delivering light using a LED light source (617 nm, Thorlabs) through a glass pipette (tip diameter ~1 mm) wrapped with foil, creating a light spot of ~2 mm diameter on the fly’s head. The output for LED was measured with a power meter (S121C and PM100A, Thorlabs) at a position corresponding to the fly’s head, and was adjusted to 1 μW/mm2for Fig.3e–hand 2.1 μW/mm2for the rest of the experiments. As for neurons labeled by Tk-GAL42, 40 ms pulse light was applied at 25 Hz; as for Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons, light was applied at frequencies specified in the figures, with the pulse duration adjusted for each frequency so that light was applied half the stimulation period on average (i.e. 500 ms for 1 Hz, 166.7 ms for 3 Hz, 83.3 ms for 6 Hz, 50 ms for 10 Hz, 41.7 ms for 12 Hz, 20 ms for 25 Hz, and 8.3 ms for 60 Hz). The averages of results of all frequencies are shown in Fig.4k, land Supplementary Fig.4e, but frequency-wise results are also shown in Supplementary Fig.4f, g. Light stimuli were triggered by python through an Arduino board connected to the LED driver. As for Fig.4k, land Supplementary Fig.4d–g, red light was applied concomitantly with air puffs to the fly whose third segments (a3) of antennae were surgically removed. We took this approach because a3 houses wind-sensing neurons, and a3-less flies tended to increase locomotion without gating visual aversion. The following antibodies were used: mouse nc82 (1:10 Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank Cat# nc82), goat anti-mouse Alexa 633 (1:100, Molecular Probe #A21050). Whole brain immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously97,98. Briefly, brains were dissected out in 0.3% PBST, and were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/ PBS for 90 min at room temperature. Brains were then washed in 0.3% PBST, for >3 h, and were blocked in 10% normal goat serum/ 0.3% PBST for 30 min. Brains were incubated in the primary antibodies in 10% normal goat serum/ 0.3% PBST at 4 °C for 2 days. Brains were then washed in 0.3% PBST for >5 h, and were blocked in 10% normal goat serum/ 0.3% PBST for 30 min. Brains were then incubated in the secondary antibodies in 10% normal goat serum/ 0.3% PBST at 4 °C for 2 days. Afterward, brains were washed in 0.3% PBST for >5 h, and incubated in 50% glycerol/ 0.3% PBST for 2 h at 4 °C. Lastly, brains were mounted on slide glass in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken with Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (LASX (v1.1.0.12420)), and processed in Image J (NIH, v1.53t) software. Two-photon calcium imaging was conducted as described previously99with a few modifications. Two-photon microscopy (Bergamo II, Thorlabs) with a 16x objective lens (16x CFI LWP Plan Flour Objective, Nikon) and with near-infrared excitation (930 nm, Mai Tai 2, SpectraPhysics. Inc., Mountain View, CA), along with ThorImage LS (v3.2.2018.4241) and MaiTai (v0250-2.00.23), was used. Cuticle of the top of the flies’ head and the fat and trachea beneath it were surgically removed. The exposed brain was submerged in saline solution. The extracellular saline had the following composition (in mM): 103 NaCl, 3 KCl, 5 HEPES, 10 trehalose, 10 glucose, 7 sucrose, 26 NaHCO3, 1 NaH2PO4, 1.5 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2.We identified Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons using the baseline fluorescence of GCaMP. Although the Gal4 driver line used for this experiment labeled neurons other than Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons, soma of Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons form a cluster exclusively in the superior medial protocerebrum, allowing us to unambiguously separate these neurons from the rest. jGCaMP7f was used for all experiments but Fig.5h, iand Supplementary Fig.5a, in which GCaMP6s was used instead. Images were acquired from 10 planes at 4 frames per s (256 × 256 pixels, pixel size = 0.399 µm, dwell time = 0.154 µs) for GCaMP6s, and 1 plane at 152 frames per s (160 × 96 pixels, pixel size = 0.388 µm, dwell time = 0.246 µs) for jGCaMP7f. During calcium imaging, a large fraction of the fly’s body was glued to the holding plate, and part of the fly’s eye compounds was covered with the holder, and the fly was hung in the air without an air-supported ball. Visual object was presented by equipping the two-photon microscopy with the LED matrices used in the behavioral experiments, with several modifications: first, the background color was blue instead of green, to prevent the background light from interfering with the GCaMP signal. Second, in order to minimize the bleed-through of the blue light to the range of green, the entirety of the fly, fly holder, and the objective lens were covered with foil, but with an opening through which the fly could see the LED matrices. A blue-pass glass filter was attached to this opening, again to minimize the bleed-through of the blue light to the range of green. The blue-pass glass filter was composed of four filters, each measuring 35 × 50 × 2.5 mm (E-B390, HOYA). A pair of filters were stacked to double the thickness (thus measuring 35 × 50 × 5 mm), and were attached perpendicular to its identical counterpart to form a L-shaped structure. This L-shaped filter was placed so that each inner wall of the “L” faces the fly at 45 degrees from left and right. As for the presentation timing of air puffs and a visual object, we implemented a couple of schedules, one with a reversed order of the other, to control for the effect of timing: 1. rest > visual object > rest > puff > rest > puff > visual object > rest, 2. rest > puff > visual > rest > puff > rest > visual > rest. Data of these schedules were pooled for Fig.6b-eand Supplementary Fig.6k. Each fly underwent the sequence of stimuli per fly either twice, three times, or four times, depending on the angle of the brain relative to the objective lens, to scan as many Tk-GAL42∩ Vglut neurons as possible distributed along z axis. The time courses of ΔF/F0(Fig.5e, h) were calculated by, for each bin, taking the percent difference from F immediately prior to the onset of the initial puff application (t = 30 for Fig.5e; t = 5 for Fig.5h). ΔF/F0was transformed into z score as, for each cell: (ΔF/F0 [t]– average(ΔF/F0)) / sd(ΔF/F0), where t indicates time, average indicates the average across time, and sd indicates standard deviation. Neurons that increased calcium signals by more than one z-score upon air puffs were deemed puff responders in Supplementary Fig.5eand Supplementary Fig.6k. Frequency-wise power for each cell was calculated from z-scores by Morlet wavelet transform, using morlet function provided by dplR package in R. This frequency-wise power was then transformed into frequency-band-wise power by, for each frequency band and time, taking the mean value across frequencies that belong to the frequency band. Δpower (Fig.6b–e, Supplementary Fig.6c–k, Fig.7e) were calculated by, for each neuron and frequency band, averaging the signals in a given time window and by subtracting from those values the average signal of corresponding frequency band of the time bin (0.5 s) preceding the time window. Because the increase in theta power was specific to the neurons that responded positively to air puffs (Supplementary Fig.6k), we limited the calculation of Δpower (Fig.6b–e, Supplementary Fig.6c–j, Fig.7e) to these neurons. Data analyses were performed using our custom-written R and python programs. All diagrams were constructed using Inkscape (v1.2,https://inkscape.org/), PowerPoint (v2301, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA), and Blender (v.2.93.1,https://www.blender.org/). We did not predetermine the sample sizes. The distribution of normality of each group was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk normality test. Parametric tests (unequal variancest-test known as Welch’st-test or one-way ANOVA) were used only when distributions were deemed normal; otherwise, non-parametric tests were used (Wilcoxon signed rank test for one-sample tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum test for two-sample tests, and Kruskal-Wallis H test). All statistical tests were two-sided. We employed Bonferroni correction to correct for two testing, and Benjamini–Hochberg correction for more than two testing. p < 0.05 after corrections for multiple comparison was deemed statistically significant. Neither randomization nor blinding was performed for the group allocation during experiments or data analysis. All box plots are generated so that center line indicates median, box limits indicate upper and lower quartiles, and whiskers indicate 1.5× interquartile range. All the statistical results are summarized in Supplementary Data3. Further information on research design is available in theNature Portfolio Reporting Summarylinked to this article.

Researchers found that in fruit fly brains, these neurons release a chemical called tachykinin which appears to control the fly’s movement to avoid facing a potential threat. Fruit fly brains can offer a useful analogy for larger mammals, so this research may help us better understand our own human reactions to scary situations and phobias. Next, the team want to find out how these neurons fit into the wider circuitry of the brain so they can ultimately map out how fear controls vision.
Do you cover your eyes during horror movies? Or perhaps the sight of a spider makes you turn and run? Avoiding looking at things which scare us is a common experience, for humans and animals. But what actually makes us avert our gaze from the things we fear? Researchers have found that it may be due to a group of neurons in the brain which regulates vision when feeling afraid.
“We discovered a neuronal mechanism by which fear regulates visual aversion in the brains ofDrosophila(fruit flies). It appears that a single cluster of 20-30 neurons regulates vision when in a state of fear. Since fear affects vision across animal species, including humans, the mechanism we found may be active in humans as well,” explained Assistant Professor Masato Tsuji from the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Tokyo.
The team used puffs of air to simulate a physical threat and found that the flies’ walking speed increased after being puffed at. The flies also would choose a puff-free route if offered, showing that they perceived the puffs as a threat (or at least preferred to avoid them). Next the researchers placed a small black object, roughly the size of a spider, 60 degrees to the right or left of the fly. On its own the object didn’t cause a change in behavior, but when placed following puffs of air, the flies avoided looking at the object and moved so that it was positioned behind them.
To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this aversion behavior, the team then used mutated flies in which they altered the activity of certain neurons. While the mutated flies kept their visual and motor functions, and would still avoid the air puffs, they did not respond in the same fearful manner to visually avoid the object.
“This suggested that the cluster of neurons which releases the chemical tachykinin was necessary for activating visual aversion,” said Tsuji. “When monitoring the flies’ neuronal activity, we were surprised to find that it occurred through an oscillatory pattern, i.e., the activity went up and down similar to a wave. Neurons typically function by just increasing their activity levels, and reports of oscillating activity are particularly rare in fruit flies because up until recently the technology to detect this at such a small and fast scale didn’t exist.”
By giving the flies genetically encoded calcium indicators, the researchers could make the flies’ neurons shine brightly when activated. Thanks to the latest imaging techniques, they then saw the changing, wavelike pattern of light being emitted, which was previously averaged out and missed.
Next, the team wants to figure out how these neurons fit into the broader circuitry of the brain. Although the neurons exist in a known visual region of the brain, the researchers do not yet know from where the neurons are receiving inputs and to where they are transmitting them, to regulate visual escape from objects perceived as dangerous.
“Our next goal is to uncover how visual information is transmitted within the brain, so that we can ultimately draw a complete circuit diagram of how fear regulates vision,” said Tsuji. “One day, our discovery might perhaps provide a clue to help with the treatment of psychiatric disorders stemming from exaggerated fear, such as anxiety disorders and phobias.”

Magnetic bacteria point the way,"Magnetosome-producing microorganisms can sense and move toward the redox gradient and have been extensively studied in terrestrial and shallow marine sediment environments. However, given the difficulty of sampling, magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are poorly explored in deep-sea hydrothermal fields. In this study, a deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney from the Southern Mariana Trough was collected using a remotely operated submersible. The mineralogical and geochemical characterization of the vent chimney sample showed an internal iron redox gradient. Additionally, the electron microscopy of particles collected by magnetic separation from the chimney sample revealed MTB cells with bullet-shaped magnetosomes, and there were minor occurrences of cuboctahedral and hexagonal prismatic magnetosomes. Genome-resolved metagenomic analysis was performed to identify microorganisms that formed magnetosomes. A metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) affiliated withNitrospinaehad magnetosome genes such asmamA, mamI, mamM, mamP, andmamQ. Furthermore, a diagnostic feature of MTB genomes, such as magnetosome gene clusters (MGCs), includingmamA, mamP, andmamQ, was also confirmed in theNitrospinae-affiliated MAG. Two lines of evidence support the occurrence of MTB in a deep-sea, inactive hydrothermal vent environment. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) produce membrane-enveloped single-domain magnetite (Fe3O4), greigite (Fe3S4), or both, which are called magnetosomes (Blakemore, 1975). MTB are phylogenetically affiliated within six major lineages: theAlpha-,Gamma-, andCandidatus(Ca.) Etaproteobacteria classes of theProteobacteriaphylum, theDesulfobacterotaphylum, theNitrospiraephylum, and theCa. Omnitrophica phylum (Lefèvre and Bazylinski, 2013;Lin et al., 2014a). Although the morphological features of magnetosomes are different among taxonomic groups, all magnetosomes function as a compass needle for moving along the Earth's geomagnetic field (Frankel et al., 1997). This phenomenon is called magnetotaxis, which enables MTB to inhabit the redox gradient (Frankel et al., 1997;Lefèvre and Bazylinski, 2013). MTB have access to various electron donors and acceptors along the redox gradient. Most of the major lineages use reduced sulfur compounds as energy sources, such as hydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, and sulfite, whereas O2, sulfate, and fumarate are utilized as electron acceptors (Lefèvre et al., 2013;Goswami et al., 2022). Carbon fixation is mediated byProteobacteria, Desulfobacterota, andNitrospiraevia the Calvin-Benson cycle or Wood-Ljungdahl (Lefèvre et al., 2013;Goswami et al., 2022). As a result, MTB play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of iron, sulfur, carbon, and other redox-sensitive elements (Li et al., 2020). Recent studies have reported that MTB are involved in the intracellular deposition of silica (Li et al., 2022), poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (Li et al., 2021), and polymetaphosphate (Schulz-Vogt et al., 2019). MTB from shallow marine and land environments have been intensively studied for sampling feasibility (Lin et al., 2014a,2017). Light and electron microscopy was used to observe magnetically separated MTB cells, the taxonomic affiliations of which were determined using fluorescencein situhybridization (FISH) targeting cells containing single-domain magnets (Li et al., 2017). Single-cell genomics and metagenomics combined with light and electron microscopy have been applied to identify MTB by examining the presence of magnetosome gene clusters (MGCs;Kolinko et al., 2012,2013;Lin et al., 2014b,2018,2020). MGCs are consecutively arranged gene sets in MTB genomes that control magnetosome biogenesis (Grünberg et al., 2001;Uebe and Schüler, 2016;McCausland and Komeili, 2020). MGCs have recently been discovered in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that have been taxonomically classified into previously unknown bacterial lineages for MTB, such asNitrospinae, Ca. Latescibacteria, Planctomycetes, Fibrobacteres, andCa. Riflebacteria(Lin et al., 2020;Uzun et al., 2020). In contrast, MTB in deep-sea environments is largely unknown, partly because the low cell density of MTB hinders the magnetic recovery of magnetotactic cells sufficiently for FISH and single-cell genomics. In deep-sea sediments, magnetosomes have been observed with microbial cells (Liu et al., 2017;McGlynn et al., 2018;Cui et al., 2021), whereas magnetosomes have been observed without microbial cells (Dong et al., 2016;Yamazaki et al., 2019). Although the previous deep-sea studies attempted to clarify the taxonomy of MTB involved in the formation of magnetosomes by 16S rRNA gene sequences, metagenomic analysis was performed to characterize MTB, the presence of which has been demonstrated by electron microscopy in deep-sea hydrothermal sediments (Chen et al., 2022). However, their metagenomic approach was unsuccessful in revealing the taxonomic affiliations of magnetosome genes and their arrangement into MGCs. It has been demonstrated by our previous studies of deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimneys that chimney samples with high cell densities are predominantly colonized by microorganisms closely related to known MTB lineages (Suzuki et al., 2004;Kato et al., 2010,2018;Takamiya et al., 2022). In this study, magnetic separation and electron microscopy analyses were performed to detect MTB cells in a metal sulfide chimney sample from the South Mariana Trough (SMT). A genome-resolved metagenomic analysis was also performed to search for MGCs in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the vent chimney community. A metal sulfide chimney examined in this study was described in previous research (Kato et al., 2019). The chimney was collected from a hydrothermal vent field at the Pika site (12°55.130′N, 143°38.972′E) in SMT, a back-arc basin where the Philippine Sea Plate is subducted. Sampling was conducted during the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSEC) Scientific Cruises NT12-24 of the R/VNatsushimain September 2012. The sample size was at a water depth of 2,787 m, and thein situtemperature of the deep seawater was 1.7°C. No fluid emanating from the chimney was observed on the sample during video observations. The chimney structure unassociated with fluid venting was collected by the manipulator arm of the remotely operated vehicle,Hyper Dolphin(HPD). The chimney structure was enclosed in an HPD container to minimize contamination from the surrounding seawater during transportation to the sea surface. After the retrieval, the chimney structure was named Pika55, which was also described as IPdc byKato et al. (2019)and was immediately subsampled onboard in a cold room at 4°C. First, the tip of the metal sulfide chimney sample (shown by a white arrow inFigure 1A) was soaked two times in 100% ethanol for 5 min to dehydrate, and the chimney sample was infiltrated four times with LR White Resin for 30 min and solidified in an oven at 50°C for 48 h. Solidified blocks were cut into thin sections and polished with corundum powder and diamond paste. Then, after the removal of the chimney tip, the interior and exterior portions of the chimney sample were separated using sterile chisels and spatulas. The exterior portion was named Pika55ext. Subsequently, Pika55ext was ground into powder using a sterile pestle and mortar and stored at −80°C for magnetic separation and metagenomic analysis. Finally, some ground samples were fixed with 3.7% formamide in seawater onboard for magnetic separation. Figure 1.(A)A photo of the metal sulfide chimney collected from the Pika site (Pika55). An arrow shows the site where thin sections were made.(B)A photo of the thin horizontal section of Pika55.(C)A back-scattered electron image obtained by scanning electron microscopy of the thin section of Pika55. Colored bands show the areas drilled for the quantification of amorphous ferric iron.(D)Energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy spectra from the colored bands in(C). The percentages shown with the spectra indicate the amount of amorphous ferric iron in total iron. Magnetic particles were separated from the Pika55ext ground sample by sonicated dispersion in a sodium hexametaphosphate buffer solution, followed by sample collection by Nd magnets. The extracted magnetic particles dispersed in ethanol were mounted on a carbon-coated copper grid. A JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used to observe magnetic particles at an operation voltage of 120 kV. The extracted magnetic particles were prefiltered through 8.0-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters and then filtered through 0.2-μm pore size polycarbonate filters. The filtered magnetic particles were carbon-coated and observed using the S4500 scanning electron microscope (SEM; Hitachi, Ibaragi, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Finally, secondary electron imaging coupled to energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed to clarify the chemical compositions of magnetosomes. As described in a previous study, DNA extraction, library construction, and shotgun sequencing were performed (Kato et al., 2019). Using an UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA), genomic DNA was extracted from Pika55ext without the use of magnetic separation.Hirai et al. (2017)constructed a shotgun library for the extracted DNA using a KAPA Hyper Prep kit for Illumina (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). Library sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform (MiSeq PE300). The following steps were taken to reconstruct MAGs using MetaWRAP v.1.3.2 (Uritskiy et al., 2018). First, the Read_QC module included in MetaWRAP was used to trim and filter reads from the library. Following that, high-quality reads were assembled into contigs using SPAdes version 3.13.0 with the options “–meta, -k 55,77,99,111,121” (Bankevich et al., 2012). Then, the contigs were binned into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) using the Binning module [including metabat2 (Kang et al., 2015), maxbin2 (Wu et al., 2016), and concoct (Alneberg et al., 2014)] included in MetaWRAP. The MAGs from the binning tools were then refined using the bin refinement module included in MetaWRAP. For phylogenomic analysis, MAGs with a completeness of >70% and a contamination of < 5% were selected (Supplementary Table 1). The taxonomic classification was performed based on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy (Sayers et al., 2021) and the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) taxonomy (Parks et al., 2022). Magnetosome genes were searched against the MAGs using the FeGenie program with a lower maximum distance of 1 or 5 (Garber et al., 2020). BLASTP (Gish and States, 1993) was also used to search for magnetosome genes in the MAGs from this study and the NCBI database (Gish and States, 1993). Relative abundances of the MAGs in the metagenome were estimated based on the normalized read coverage values using the Quant Bins module included in MetaWRAP. Known MTB genomes were downloaded from the NCBI database against which magnetosome genes were searched using the FeGenie program (Garber et al., 2020). Then, the amino acid sequences of magnetosome genes were aligned using Muscle v.3.8.8425 (Edgar, 2004) within the ARB software (Ludwig et al., 2004) and filtered using the TrimAl program (Capella-Gutierrez et al., 2009) with the “-gappyout” option. Additionally, maximum-likelihood phylogenetic protein trees were constructed using RAxML v.8.2.11 (Stamatakis, 2014) in the Geneious Prime software. The maximum-likelihood trees were obtained using the 1,000 bootstrap-resampling approaches. Protein trees were visualized using FigTree v.1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and were rooted at the midpoint. Based on 120 concatenated bacterial single-copy marker proteins, a maximum-likelihood tree was constructed forNitrospinaegenomes downloaded from the GTDB database (Parks et al., 2017). With the “-gappyout” option, the TrimAl program was used to trim concatenated sequences. The Geneious Prime software's RAxML v.8.2.11 was used to build the maximum-likelihood tree. The maximum-likelihood tree was obtained using the 1,000 bootstrap-resampling approach. The tree was rooted withThermodesulfovibrio yellowstoniiDSM 11347 and visualized using FigTree v.1.4.4. A curated set of genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism were searched using METABOLIC v.4.0 (Zhou et al., 2022), which annotates genes through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG;Ogata et al., 1999), TIGRfam (Selengut et al., 2007), Pfam (Finn et al., 2014), and custom hidden Markov model profiles. Using DiSCo, genes involved in sulfur metabolism, such asdsrABCDEFHJKMOP, aprAB, andsat, were annotated (Neukirchen and Sousa, 2021). KEGG was used to annotatesir, which METABOLIC and DiSCo did not annotate. InSupplementary Table 2, the complete names of metabolic genes and the related annotation tools are presented. Thin sections of the metal sulfide chimney collected from SMT called Pika55 were examined to reveal the redox gradient, which is potentially important for magnetotaxis in the chimney. Light microscopy observations showed that the internal structure was concentrated in three layers (Figures 1A,B). The outermost layer was reddish, and a gray layer was present inside the reddish layer. Moreover, the innermost metallic gold layer had a reddish inner rim. The combination of these layers is typical for metal sulfide chimneys found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents (Haymon, 1983). Additionally, SEM observations with back-scattered electron imaging and EDS analysis were performed to show that the chimney mainly comprises iron and sulfur or iron, copper, and sulfur (Figures 1C,D). In the outer layer, a dark contrast phase relative to metal sulfides was composed of Fe, Si, and O (Figures 1C,D). In contrast, the two inner layers were unassociated with the iron silicate phase. As the iron silicate phase is likely composed of ferric iron due to the oxidative alteration of iron-bearing sulfides, the valence state of iron was clarified by a colorimetric ferrozine-based assay (Lovley and Phillips, 1986) coupled with the micron-scale drilling technique (Sakai and Kodan, 2011). The reddish layer contained 59.3% of amorphous ferric iron in the total iron extracted with 0.5-M HCl (red band and EDS spectrum inFigures 1C,D), whereas the inner and outer portions of the gray layer contained 12.7% (blue bands and EDS spectrum inFigures 1C,D). The innermost metallic layer contained 16.8% amorphous ferric iron in total iron extracted with 0.5-N HCl (yellow band and EDS spectrum inFigures 1C,D). Finally, there appears to be a redox gradient between the outermost and innermost parts of the chimney structure. First, magnetic separation of the metal sulfide chimney sample from SMT was performed. TEM observations of the magnetically separated particles revealed microbial cells with bullet-shaped magnetosomes (Figures 2A–C). The bullet-shaped magnetosomes in ~200-nm-wide and 500-nm-long microbial cells were arranged into a single chain (Figure 2A). SEM observations and EDS analysis of a microbial cell with bullet-shaped magnetosomes, similarly observed by TEM, revealed that the bullet-shaped magnetosomes were composed of Fe and O without S (Figures 2D,E). The observed morphology types of the magnetosomes without microbial cells were categorized as bullet-shaped, cuboctahedral, and hexagonal prismatic (Figures 2B,C). Enumeration of each morphology type revealed the dominance of bullet-shaped magnetosomes in the chimney sample (Figure 2F). As the composition of cuboctahedral and hexagonal prismatic magnetosomes was not examined, the possibility that these particles were not magnetosomes cannot be ruled out. Based on TEM images, the length and width of bullet-shaped crystals associated with and without microbial cells (n= 253) were measured. The median length and axial ratio (width/length) were 65.2 nm and 0.525, respectively (Figure 2G). The distribution of crystal size is significantly uniform, relative to that of bullet-shaped magneto fossils in surface marine sediments from the Japan Sea (Yamazaki, 2020). These results indicate the inhabitation of a limited species of MTB in a metal sulfide chimney. Figure 2.(A)A TEM image of a cell with bullet-shaped magnetosomes.(B, C)TEM images of magnetosomes unassociated with cells. Black arrows show cubo-octahedral magnetosomes.

(F)Observed a number of morphology types of magnetosomes.(G)Cumulative probability distribution of length and axial ratio (width/length) for bullet-shaped crystals extracted from the chimney sample in this study (red) and from Japan Sea surface sediments (blue;Yamazaki, 2020). Metagenomic analysis was performed to obtain MAGs from the vent chimney samples (Table 1). Based on reading coverage values, abundant NCBI-based taxonomic groups wereNitrospirae(p_Nitrospirota; c_Thermodesulfovibrionia; o_Thermodesulfovibrionales; f_JdFR-85; and g__BMS3Bbin07 based on the GTDB taxonomy) represented by a MAG named Idc_ex_meta_mg7 andGammaproteobacteria(p_Proteobacteria; c_Gammaproteobacteria; o_Arenicellales; and f-s_BMS3Bbin11 based on the GTDB taxonomy) represented by a MAG named Idc_ex_meta_mg1 (Table 1). 16S rRNA gene sequences were not found in all MAGs except for the MAG Idc_ex_meta_mg1. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, the MAG Idc_ex_meta_mg1 had no close MTB relatives. All MAGs were subjected to a FeGenie search againstmamABEIKLMOPQ.mamABEIKLMOPQwere selected because these magnetosome genes are universal for magnetite production by MTB (Kolinko et al., 2016;Uebe and Schüler, 2016). As a result, it was revealed thatmamA, mamI, mamM, mamP, andmamQwere found in a MAG called Idc_ex_meta_mg2 affiliated withNitrospinae(p_Nitrospinota; c-o_UBA7883 based on the GTDB taxonomy). The consecutive arrangement ofmamP, mamA, andmamQwith locus tags of Idc_ex_meta_mg2_1352 to 1354 in theNitrospinae-affiliated MAG supports the presence of an MGC (Supplementary Table 1). Other magnetosome genes previously found inNitrospinae-affiliated MAGs (nPCR_bin9 and nNGH_bin12;Lin et al., 2020) were searched, and the arrangement of the MGC (mamP, mamA, andmamQ) in Idc_ex_meta_mg2 is similar to those from the otherNitrospinae-affiliated MAGs (Figure 3andSupplementary Table 1). As a result, the presence of two other MGC clusters was due to the composition ofmamI, mamH, mmsF, mms6, mamT, andmamS, andman3andmamM(Figure 3andSupplementary Table 1). The former cluster was similar to that found in nNGH_bin12, whereas the latter cluster was similar to that in nPCR_bin9 (Figure 3). It should be noted that the MGCs found in theNitrospinae-affiliated MAGs were similar to those inAlphaproteobacteriaandCa. Etaprotebacteria but clearly different from those inDesulfobacteria, Nitrospirae, andCa. Omnitrophica. AlthoughmamAandmamEwere detected in MAGs other thanNitrospinae(non-NitrospinaeMAGs) by FeGenie, the detectedmamAandmamEwere not consecutively arranged without forming MGCs. AlthoughmamAandmamEfound in non-NitrospinaeMAGs may function in magnetosome formation, the functions ofmamAandmamEin non-NitrospinaeMAGs need to be clarified. Table 1. List of metagenome-assembled genomes and their genomic features. Figure 3. Comparison of magnetosome gene cluster arrangements inNitrospinae-affiliated MAGs from this study (Idc_ex_meta_mg2) and a previous study (Lin et al., 2020). Magnetosome genes annotated by FeGenie, in addition to BLASTP scoring, are indicated in bold font (Table 1andSupplementary Table 1). Phylogenetic trees were constructed formamAMQfound in theNitrospinae-affiliated MAG obtained in this study (Figure 4).MamAMQgenes were selected because the gene sequences are present in most MTB genomes with sufficient sequence lengths for phylogenetic analysis (Lin et al., 2020). Consequently, themamAMQsequences from the chimneyNitrospinaeformed a monophyletic clade with those fromNitrospinae-affiliated genomes from public databases rather than those from the other major taxonomic groups of MTB, except for themamQgene (Figure 4). The low bootstrap values might have resulted from the genetic divergence of magnetosome genes inNitrospinae. Based on the relatedness of theNitrospinae-affiliated magnetosome genes, the MGC appears to be encoded in the chimneyNitrospinaegenome. Although the presence of MGC is a prerequisite for MTB, it remains to be determined whether the chimneyNitrospinaeis capable of producing magnetosomes. Figure 4. Phylogenetic trees of magnetosome genes,mamAMQ. The trees were constructed with themamgenes of known MTB (Proteobacteria, Desulfobacteria, andNitrospirae) andNitrospinaegenomes. Filled and open black circles at nodes represent 1,000 pseudoreplicate bootstrap values higher than 75 and 50%, respectively. Complete trees are shown inSupplementary Figures 1–3. Genes involved in energy-yielding metabolic pathways were annotated using METABOLIC and DiSCo (Supplementary Table 2). The presence ofnrfH(locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_0657) in the chimneyNitrospinaegenome indicates nitrite reduction as the terminal electron-accepting process (Idc_ex_meta_mg2 inFigure 5). In mediating nitrite reduction,nrfAis essentially present at the consecutive downstream ofnrfH.nrfAwas found downstream of theNitrospinaegenome (locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_0656), wherein lysine, a motif sequence, was substituted with histidine. This substitution has also been found in anrfA-like gene inCampylobacter jejuni(Einsle et al., 2000), whose nitrite-reducing ability has been demonstrated (Pittman et al., 2007). Thus, the chimneyNitrospinaemay depend on nitrite as the electron acceptor. As for the energy source, sulfur oxidizers have an operon, includingdsrEFHand a Dsr-Apr-Sat system, typically possessed by sulfate reducers (Dahl et al., 2008). In theNitrospinaegenome,dsrA(locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_1291),dsrE(locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_1294),dsrF(locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_1293),dsrH(locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_1292),sat(locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_1547), andaprB(locus tag: Idc_ex_meta_mg2_0024) were found (Figure 5). These results indicate the potential that the chimneyNitrospinaeis a nitrite-reducing sulfur oxidizer. Figure 5. A maximum-likelihood tree of 120 concatenated bacterial single-copy marker proteins fromNitrospinaegenomes, as well as a heat map ofNitrospinaegenomes showing the presence or absence of genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolisms as well as magnetosome genes. Genes involved in magnetosome formation were annotated by FeGenie. Other genes were annotated by METABOLIC and DiSCo. A concatenated sequence obtained in this study is indicated in bold letters, whereas concatenated sequences containing MGCs are indicated in red letters. At nodes in the tree, filled and open black circles represent 1,000 pseudoreplicate bootstrap values higher than 75 and 50%, respectively. The absence ofaclABin Clade A may be due to the low similarity ofaclABsequences in Clade A genomes to knownaclABsequences. Nitrospina gracilis, a cultivated member of the phylumNitrospinae, is a chemolithoautotroph that generates energy by oxidizing nitrite (Lucker et al., 2013). DraftNitrospinaegenomes were submitted to comparative genomic analysis to clarify the variation of metabolic pathways in phylogenetically diverse members of the phylumNitrospinae(Figure 5andSupplementary Table 3). Three class-level clades were identified using a maximum likelihood tree from the concatenated sequences of 120 bacterial single-copy marker genes. Clade A includedN. gracilis, whereas Clade B and Clade C included uncultivated taxa. The chimney genome (Idc_ex_meta_mg2) and the other MGC-encoding genomes were found in Clade C.N. gracilisuses the reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle for CO2fixation.Aclis a key enzyme in the rTCA, andN. gracilishas anaclABwith low sequence similarities to knownaclABs(Lucker et al., 2013). The low sequence similarities causedaclABto be undetected by most of the Clade A genomes, includingN. gracilisby METABOLIC. In contrast,aclABwas detected in many Clade B and C genomes, including the chimneyNitrospinae. Thus, the chimneyNitrospinaeis most likely a chemolithautotroph that uses rTCA for CO2fixation.nxrAB, which is involved in nitrite oxidation byN. gracilis(Lucker et al., 2013), was present in 11 genomes affiliated with Clade A, butnxrABwas absent in 13 genomes affiliated with Clades B and C, except for HyVt-426.sir, indicated to be involved in assimilatory sulfite reduction byN. gracilis(Lucker et al., 2013), was detected in many genomes from Clade A and Clade C. Sulfur oxidation genes such asdsrEFHwere not found in Clade A genomes, which is consistent with the use of nitrite as an energy source. In contrast, many genomes affiliated with Clades B and C containeddsrEFH, as well asaprABandsat. According to these results, the metabolic potential of the chimneyNitrospinaeappears to be common in Clade C but is clearly distinct from that of Clade A, which includesN. gracilis. Taken together, the bacteria from the phylumNitrospinaeplay an important role in carbon fixation in dark deep-sea environments. In this study, magnetosomes in a metal sulfide chimney were demonstrated through direct observations of magnetically separated cells. Based on the genome-resolved metagenomic analysis, some of these magnetosomes could have originated fromNitrospinae-affiliated populations possessing genes involved in magnetosome production. Thus, our results expand the ecological diversity of magnetosome-producing MTB. However, it is still unclear what the ecological advantage of magnetosomes in the metal sulfide chimney is. To answer this question, further culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses are needed. The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material.

Previously observed on land and in shallow water, analysis of a hydrothermal vent has proven that they can also survive deep under the ocean. The bacteria were able to exist in an environment that was not ideal for their typical needs. Magnetotactic bacteria are of interest not only for the role they play in Earth’s ecosystem, but also in the search for extraterrestrial life. Evidence of their existence can remain in rocks for billions of years. Their magnetic inclinations can also provide a record of how magnetic poles have shifted over time. This new discovery brings hope to researchers that the magnetic bacteria might be found in yet more unexpected locations, on Earth and perhaps even on Mars or beyond.
Magnetotactic bacteria seem to have superpowers. Much like the Marvel Comics character Magneto, they can “sense” the Earth’s magnetic field. These tiny organisms contain magnetosomes, iron crystals wrapped in a membrane, which arrange themselves to align with the Earth’s magnetic field and point the bacteria like a compass. This causes the bacteria to travel in the direction of Earth’s magnetic field lines leading north or south, like trains on a magnetic track. As part of their life cycle, they play an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and other key elements in nature. They have been well studied on land and in shallow water, but rarely in deep water where collecting them can be a challenge.
In September 2012, a team including researchers from the University of Tokyo embarked on a scientific ocean cruise to the southern Mariana Trough in the western Pacific Ocean. Using a remotely operated underwater vehicle named HYPER-DOLPHIN, they collected a “chimney” from a hydrothermal vent field 2,787 meters (almost 4.5 times the height of Tokyo Skytree or more than 6 times the height of the Empire State Building in New York) underwater. Hydrothermal vents are formed when seawater percolates down underground, eventually becoming superheated — up to 400 degrees Celsius — by magma which causes it to boil back up. The erupting water deposits minerals and metals into the ocean which layer up to form chimneys, providing a warm, rich habitat for many unique forms of life.
“We discovered magnetotactic bacteria living on the chimney, which we didn’t expect. Due to the chimney’s shape, it lacks a clear, vertical chemical gradient which these bacteria typically prefer, ” explained Associate Professor Yohey Suzuki from the Graduate School of Science at the University of Tokyo. “The bacteria we collected contained mainly ‘bullet’-shaped magnetosomes, which we see as a ‘primitive’ form and so inferred that they have not changed much over many millennia. Indeed, the environment we found them in is similar to early Earth about 3.5 billion years ago, when the ancestor of magnetotactic bacteria is estimated to have emerged.”
Bacteria were collected from the rim of the chimney using a magnet. The team then examined the genetic data and found that they were related to the bacteria Nitrospinae, which are known to play an important role in carbon fixation in deep-sea environments, but which were not known to contain any magnetotactic groups.
“Deep-sea hydrothermal vents attract attention not only as the birthplace of unique underwater life, but also as a potential analogous habitat for extraterrestrial life,” said Suzuki. “The environment where we sampled the bacteria is similar to what we think Mars was like when there was still flowing water on its surface, about 3 billion years ago.”
Fossilized remains of the magnetic particles in magnetotactic bacteria (known as magnetofossils) can be preserved in rock for billions of years. These magnetofossils can help researchers piece together ancient geomagnetic history and are good candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life. In 1996, the Martian meteorite Allan Hills 84001, which is about 3.6 billion years old, caused a global sensation when it appeared to contain iron-crystal fossils from bacteria-like life. The claim has since been widely disputed, but Suzuki still has hope for future discoveries: “Magnetotactic bacteria provide clues for the early diversification of bacteria and we hope they will be found beyond Earth, maybe on Mars or icy moons. For now, we will continue to look for more evidence of them in various types and ages of rocks on Earth where they were not previously thought to inhabit.”

Jean-Henri Fabre proposed 168 years ago the “law of anamorphosis”, that is, “new rings appear between the penultimate ring and the telson” and “all apodous rings in a given stadium become podous rings in the next stadium”, but the developmental process at the anamorphic molt remains largely unknown. In this study, therefore, by observing the morphological and histological changes at the time of molting, the detailed processes of leg- and ring-addition during anamorphosis were characterized in a millipede,Niponia nodulosa(Polydesmida, Cryptodesmidae). In the preparatory period, a few days before molting, scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and histological observations revealed that two pairs of wrinkled leg primordia were present under the cuticle of each apodous ring. In the rigidation period, just prior to molt, observations of external morphology showed that a transparent protrusion was observed on the median line of the ventral surface on each apodous ring. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and histological observations revealed that the transparent protrusion covered by an arthrodial membrane contained a leg bundle consisting of two pairs of legs. On the other hand, ring primordia were observed anterior to the telson just before molts. Preceding the anamorphic molt in which two pairs of legs are added on an apodous ring, a transparent protrusion containing the leg pairs (a leg bundle) appears on each apodous ring. The morphogenetic process of the rapid protrusion of leg bundles, that is enabled by thin and elastic cuticle, suggested that millipedes have acquired a resting period and unique morphogenesis to efficiently add new legs and rings. So far, many evo-devo studies in arthropods have focused on the mechanisms of segmentation and appendage formation, providing us with a number of important questions about the body-plan evolution [1,2,3]. Arthropods gradually change their forms through repeated molting events during postembryonic development. In arthropods, two developmental modes are known, anamorphosis and epimorphosis [4,5,6,7]. In anamorphosis, new segments are added with molting, that is, segmentation and appendage formation are not completed during embryogenesis, but continue through postembryonic development (e.g., sea spiders, copepods, remipedes, proturans) [8,9,10,11]. On the other hand, in epimorphosis, as seen in insects, the numbers of segments and legs are determined at the time of hatching and remain constant throughout postembryonic development. This means that segmentation and appendage formation are completed during embryogenesis. Furthermore, anamorphosis is classified into three types based on the patterns of molting and segment addition [6]. In hemianamorphosis, the addition of new segments and legs goes on until a certain instar, and then further moltings take place without the addition of segments or legs. In other words, this mode involves first anamorphosis, and secondly, epimorphosis. In euanamorphosis, every molting is accompanied by the addition of new segments and legs, even beyond the acquisition of sexual maturity. There is no limit to the number of moltings, and the addition continues until the death of the animal. In teloanamorphosis, every molting is accompanied by the addition of new segments and legs, but further molting does not occur after reaching adulthood. Among the three, hemianamorphosis is considered the plesiomorphic mode in arthropods [12,13]. Since epimorphosis is thought to have derived from anamorphosis [7], investigations on anamorphosis would be important for understanding the ancestral pattern of segmentation and appendage formation in arthropods. However, information about morphogenetic processes involved in anamorphosis is scarce. In particular, the subphylum Myriapoda has been less studied than other arthropods, e.g., insects, and knowledge about its developmental processes is limited. Since modes of postembryonic development are remarkably diversified in myriapods, elucidation of these processes in myriapods would provide insights into the evolution of body-plan diversity in arthropods. Myriapoda consists of four classes: Chilopoda (centipedes), Diplopoda (millipedes), Pauropoda (pauropods), and Symphyla (symphylans) [14]. In Myriapoda, all four modes of postembryonic development (epimorphosis, hemianamorphosis, euanamorphosis, and teloanamorphosis) have been observed [6,15]. Hemianamorphosis is regarded as the ancestral mode [12,13]. It is considered that enanamorphisis and teloanamorphosis evolved from hemianamorphosis after diversification of the infraclass Helminthomorpha (class Diplopoda) and epimorphosis was derived from the hemianamorphic chilopod lineage [16]. The body of an arthropod consists of a ""segment"" that is a serially homologous body unit with a pair of appendages. The terminology of the segment is somewhat complicated in millipedes. In ring-forming millipedes, the body ring which is formed by the fusion of tergite, pleurite and sternite does not correspond to a “true” segment [17,18,19]. The first tergite with no leg pairs, i.e., collum, can be regarded as the first ring although it is not a complete ring, so that the following rings are often termed as the second, third, and fourth rings, each of which has a single pair of legs, therefore called “haplorings.” Each of the fifth and subsequent rings has two pairs of legs, because it is thought to have derived from the fusion of two segments, therefore called “diplorings” [18,19]. In this paper, therefore, the term ""ring"" is used to discuss a body unit in millipedes. A French entomologist Fabre observed the postembryonic development ofPolydesmus complanatus(Polydesmida, Polydesmidae) and described it as “Chaque nouvel anneau apparaît entre l'avant-dernier et l'anneau anal.” (Each new ring appears between the penultimate and the telson) and “Tous les anneaux apodes d'un stade deviennent pédigères au stade suivant.” (All apodous rings in a given stadium, i.e., instar, become podous rings in the next stadium) [20]. This pattern has been called the “law of anamorphosis” and this law was shown to be applicable to some other millipede species (e.g., [21]). So far, this law is known to be applicable to the three millipede groups: (1) the ring-forming groups (Polydesmida and Juliformia), (2) Chordeumatida, and (3) at least some Polyzoniida [6]. However, the morphogenetic processes leading to the ring and leg addition at the time of molt are largely unknown. In the hothouse millipede,Oxidus gracilis(Polydesmida, Paradoxosomatidae), just before molting, a “leg bud” that will give rise to each newly added leg appears [22], although the developmental process has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, to clarify the processes of the ring and leg addition following the law of anamorphosis, observations of the morphological changes during molting were carried out in a millipede,Niponia nodulosa(Polydesmida, Cryptodesmidae). The postembryonic developmental schedules have been described for some polydesmids (Polydesmida), namely,Oxidus gracilis[22],Ampelodesmus iyonis(Pyrgodesmidae) [23], andXystodesmus gracilipes(Xystodesmidae) [24]. However, all of these previous studies only clarified the schedule and pattern of the anamorphosis, and no detailed morphological and histological observations were performed at the anamorphic molt. All polydesmids are known to develop by teloanamorphosis.Niponia nodulosais known to develop by teloanamorphosis, like other polydesmid species. Stadium I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII juveniles and stadium VIII (adults) have respectively 7, 9, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20 rings (Fig.1A) [25]. Based on the description of the postembryonic development, in molts from at least stadium III, it appears that all apodous rings in a given stadium become podous rings in the next stadium and new rings are added between the penultimate ring and the telson (Fig.1B). The law of anamorphosis can also be applied toN. nodulosa. The following behaviors are observed inN. nodulosaat the time of molt (Fig.1C) [25]. Prior to each molt, juveniles ofN. nodulosaconstruct molting chambers in which they molt to the subsequent stadium. The period from the start of the molting chamber construction until the molting chamber is completely constructed is defined as the preparatory period. Even at the late preparatory period when the molting chamber has been completely constructed, the millipede in it still can move. The rigidation period is defined as the period when the millipedes curl up and become motionless. The time required for each period is 2–3 days for the preparatory period and 3–4 days for the rigidation period. After the molting, i.e., exuviation, the millipedes remain in the molting chamber for 2–4 days until they are able to move sufficiently, which is defined as the recovery period.

The same pattern is also seen in other molts. Scale bars show 5 mm In this study, detailed stereomicroscopy of live juveniles of the focal species at the late preparatory period and the rigidation period was performed, in addition to scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and histological observations. Stadium IV–VII juveniles were used because the law of anamorphosis fit their developmental patterns well. For comparison, stereomicroscopy and scanning electron microscopy observation ofEpanerchodussp. (Polydesmida, Polydesmidae) were performed. To elucidate morphological changes at the time of molt to the next stadium, observations were performed on external morphologies of juveniles at the late preparatory and the rigidation period. In stadium IV–VII juveniles at the late preparatory period, no distinct primordial structure was found on the ventral surface of the apodous rings (Fig.2A–D). In stadium IV–VII juveniles at the rigidation period, transparent protrusions were observed on the ventral surface of the tail ends (Fig.2E–L). The number of transparent protrusions corresponded to the number of apodous rings. Namely, 3, 2, 1 and 1 protrusions were observed respectively at the end of stadium IV, V, VI and VII juveniles.

Scale bars show 500 μm (A–L) and 200 μm (M–P) Based on SEM observations on stadium IV and V juveniles at the rigidation period, each transparent protrusion was seen on rings between an apodous ring and the posterior ring on the median line (Fig.2M–P). In stadium IV juveniles, for example, the most anterior protrusion was observed between the most anterior apodous ring and the posterior one, the second protrusion was observed between the second apodous ring and the posterior one, and the most posterior protrusion was observed between the most posterior apodous ring and the telson (Fig.2M, N). Each protrusion was covered with a thin membrane, which was a part of the membrane connecting an apodous ring with the posterior one. Histological observations on paraffin sections clarified the inner structures of the tail ends (Fig.3). In stadium V juveniles at the late preparatory period, i.e., 2–3 days before the appearance of the transparent protrusion, epithelial tissues strongly stained by hematoxylin were observed on the ventral side underneath the cuticle of both apodous rings (rings 15, 16) (Fig.3A, B). These epithelial structures were suggested to be leg primordia. These structures protruded ventrally and posteriorly as expected for legs. A thin membranous structure was observed between the posterior end of ring 15 and the anterior end of ring 16. Similarly, a similar membrane was observed between the posterior end of ring 16 and the anterior end of the preanal sclerite of the telson (Fig.3B).

Cross sections of the transparent protrusion at the rigidation period revealed that two pairs of newly added legs were wrapped in a thin membranous structure (Fig.3D). The unit composed of two pairs of legs in the transparent protrusion was called a “leg bundle”. To clarify the detailed structures and morphogenesis of leg primordia, the autofluorescence of specimens was observed using confocal laser scanning microscope in four channels simultaneously, 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm. In stadium V juveniles at the late preparatory period, two pairs of leg primordia were observed underneath the cuticle of each apodous ring (Fig.4A, C, E). Leg primordia were wrinkled and their distal regions were extended to a point on the median line. In stadium V juveniles at the rigidation period, two pairs of newly added legs were observed as a leg bundle (Fig.4B, D, F), which protruded from a point on the median line.

At the late preparatory period, two pairs of wrinkled leg primordia were observed beneath the cuticle in an apodous ring (Fig.4G, I). The tips of the leg primordia were pointed and the four of them were bundled on the median line. At the rigidation period, two pairs of newly added legs were observed as leg bundle (Fig.4H, J). Especially in stadium VI juveniles, at least six podomeres were observed in each leg, i.e., coxa, prefemur, femur, postfemur, tibia, and tarsus. SEM observations on the stadium IV, V, and VI juveniles at the rigidation period with the old cuticle that would be exuviated soon after removed clarified the structure of newly added rings (Fig.5A–F). In the stadium IV juveniles, the newly added rings, i.e., rings 15, 16, were observed posterior to ring 14. Rings 12–14 were the apparently apodous rings with the leg bundles and would become the newest podous rings after the subsequent molt. The paranota of the newly added rings were still undeveloped and not yet overhanging at the lateral side (Fig.5A, D). Similar patterns were observed in other stages.

The stadium VI juveniles ofE. sp. had one apodous ring and only one transparent protrusion. In the specimen fixed in Bouin’s solution, two pairs of legs, i.e., a leg bundle, were observed in the transparent protrusion (Fig.6B).

In the juveniles of each stadium, these observations suggested that two pairs of leg primordia are formed inside an apodous ring prior to molt into the next stadium. In the late preparatory period, the leg primordia were wrinkled structures with pointed distal tips (Fig.4A, C, E, G, I). Histological observations showed that, in contrast to the fully formed legs stained with eosin (see r14l in Fig.3B), the leg primordia were well stained with hematoxylin, suggesting a dense population of proliferating cells (Fig.3A, B) [26]. By the rigidation period, these leg primordia have elongated into a transparent protrusion and now project from the apodous ring to lie tightly along the ring posterior to it. A single transparent protrusion contained two pairs of fully segmented legs, i.e., a leg bundle (Figs.3C, D and4B, D, F, H, J). In the late preparatory period, deflated membranous structures were observed between an apodous ring and the next one (Fig.3B). In the rigidation period, transparent protrusions were covered by membranous structures. The membrane appears to derive from an arthrodial membrane that is connected to the apodous ring (Fig.2M–P). The observations suggested that the wrinkled arthrodial membrane became unfolded as the transparent protrusion elongated from the preparatory period to the rigidation period. In the rigidation period, the newly added ring was formed between the penultimate ring, i.e., the posterior apodous ring, and the telson (Fig.5A–F). By molting after the rigidation period, the old exoskeleton, including the membrane of the transparent protrusions, is exuviated. Thereby, the podous rings with functional walking legs and the new apodous ring are completely formed. These findings provide morphological and histological evidence for the ""law of anamorphosis"" proposed by Fabre [20]. A schematic diagram of the morphogenetic process through a molt inN. nodulosa. Newly added legs and rings are indicated in red. This is a representative diagram showing the pattern at stadium V, which is considered to be applicable to other stages In this study, the protrusion was also observed in another species, i.e.,Epanerchodussp., just before molting (Fig.6). A “leg bud” observed in the previous study ofOxidus gracilisis also considered to be a transparent protrusion [22]. Taken together, these findings suggest that the process of the protrusion is shared at least among species in Polydesmida. Further studies will be required to verify whether this is a common phenomenon in other millipede lineages. In general, arthropods can grow and change their morphologies only through molts. However, the discovery of this paper deviates from the general patterns. This study firstly reported, in a millipede, the transparent protrusion appears prior to the anamorphic molt, i.e., before the exuviation, enabling the leg addition on apodous rings. The protrusion accomplished by the expansion of elastic cuticle is suggested to be a unique morphogenetic process that have been specifically modified in the millipede lineage. Such morphogenetic processes by thin cuticles and not via molting are sometimes seen also in other arthropods. For example, a physogastry seen in Euarthropoda is a phenomenon of extreme inflation of the body trunk for growth during intermolt [27], such as ticks when feeding blood [28], termite queens [29,30], and larvae of Gnathiidae [31]. In another example, it is known that a head elongation of termites presoldier with soft and flexible cuticles during intermolt [32]. In contrast to these examples, the transparent protrusion observed in the millipedes is quite unique in that a particular part protrudes rapidly and the protrusion is to extend their legs. The morphogenesis by a soft cuticle without molts is suggested to have increased the morphological diversity in arthropods. Although insects develop by epimorphosis, i.e., the number of segments is constant during postembryonic development, in some holometabolous insects, adult legs are newly formed at the time of metamorphosis. In these cases, imaginal discs, i.e., undifferentiated epithelial cell masses that form adult structures, are formed inside the larval body and protruded during metamorphosis [33,34]. Such morphogenetic processes in which folded structures expand to form protrusive structures have been widely reported in postembryonic developments of insects [35,36,37]. In crustaceans, a wrinkled structure is formed during leg regeneration, and this is unfolded through molting [38]. The morphogenetic process of the leg addition inN. nodulosais also similar to the phenomenon seen in these other arthropods and this study is the first report of such morphogenesis in myriapods. On the other hand, in contrast to the development in holometabolous insects such asDrosophila, the development of the leg primordia inN. nodulosashows a unique process, in that leg morphogenesis proceeds largely in a single stage, with the elongation of the leg primordia and its protrusion as a transparent protrusion occurring prior to next molting. This pattern of morphogenesis would be a novel developmental process that has been acquired in some millipede lineages. Although holometabolous insects add their legs through the pupal stage, millipedes do not have such stages. It is possible that in order to efficiently add new legs, millipedes acquired a resting period — they build a molting chamber and rest inside — to accomplish the unique morphogenesis in each stadium. InDrosophila,the elongation of the leg disc is caused by the change in cell shape from anisometric to isometric [34]. It is necessary to clarify whether the leg morphogenesis inN. nodulosais caused by a disc-like system like inDrosophila, whether it is accompanied by massive cell proliferation, or whether it is caused by a protrusion of a cell mass that is stored within the body cavity. Such investigations would allow for more detailed comparisons with holometabolous insects. Anamorphosis has so far been observed in various arthropod lineages and the patterns of segment and leg addition have been described in some species. In Myriapoda, for example, Lithobiomorpha (Chilopoda) develops by hemianamorphosis. InLithobius pachypedatus(Lithobiidae) andEsastigmatobius longitarsis(Henicopidae), two molts are required to form the podous segment with functional legs in their anamorphic phase [39,40]. In crustaceans, isopods develop by hemianamorphosis, with the addition of two segments and one pair of walking legs, i.e., the seventh pereopods. The functional seventh pereopods gradually develop in manca stages through three molts [41,42,43]. In Chelicerata, both anamorphosis and epimorphosis are known in sea spiders (Pycnogonida) [11]. InNymphon brevirostrewhich develops by hemianamorphosis, the addition of a segment bearing the walking legs is accomplished over four molts [44]. Combining the findings of these previous studies with the results of this study, it is suggested that, generally in arthropods, multiple molting events would be required to complete podous segments via anamorphosis. This gradual postembryonic process may be a developmental constraint in arthropods. Namely, it may be impossible to add a segment with fully functional legs in a single molt. In a lineage of millipedes (Polydesmida), for example, the first molting produces apodous rings, and the second molting produces legs there. This pattern of gradual addition is probably the most efficient way to produce numerous rings and legs during postembryonic development. This study revealed the morphogenetic processes only in one millipede lineage, so further detailed observations on the postembryonic development of the millipedes will be required to elucidate the developmental basis underlying the shared mechanisms of anamorphosis. In addition, studies on developmental genetics are very limited in the postembryonic development of myriapods except for a few examples (e.g., [45]). It is possible that genes involved in segmentation and appendage formation during embryogenesis play some roles also in postembryonic development. Since modes of postembryonic development are remarkably diversified in myriapods, elucidation of these processes in myriapods would provide insights into the diversification of body-plan evolution in arthropods. This study elucidated the morphogenetic processes of ring and leg addition at the time of molting based on morphological and histological observations during postembryonic development inN. nodulosa, showing that two pairs of wrinkled leg primordia in each apodous ring rapidly elongated and protruded as a single transparent protrusion covered by an arthrodial membrane just prior to molt. Furthermore, as previously reported, our results also confirmed that the newly added rings were formed anterior to the telson. The resulting information provides an important basis for a multifaceted understanding of this unique morphogenesis, i.e., the rapid elongation of leg primordia and the appearance of transparent protrusions just prior to molt, that appears to have newly evolved in some millipede lineages, although further studies will be required to verify whether this phenomenon is widespread in other millipedes. Stadium IV–VII juveniles ofN. nodulosawere collected between September 2020 and October 2022 in Iwadono, Higashimatsuyama City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. The species of collected individuals was identified based on morphological characteristics, described in a previous study [46]. Collected individuals were incubated in plastic containers (about L: 150 × W: 90 × H: 40 mm, 10–20 individuals per container) with a humus mat at 25 °C under constant darkness. Fragments of decaying logs were used as a base for the molting chamber. Water was sprayed at weekly intervals to maintain soil humidity. For the comparison with other species, morphological observations onEpanerchodussp. (Polydesmida, Polydesmidae) were also carried out. A stadium VI juvenile was collected in May 2022 in Ishizaka, Hatoyama Town, Saitama Prefecture. The identification of species was not possible because it was juvenile and did not have gonopods, a useful identification trait. Collected individuals were observed and photographed using a digital camera (Raynox DCR-250 Super MacroScan Conversion lens + Canon EF100mm attached to Canon EOS 8000D) and a stereomicroscope (SZX16; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a digital camera (DP50; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Furthermore, to examine the detailed structures of the ventral surface and leg primordia of the tail ends, observations by scanning electron microscope (SEM) were also carried out. Juveniles in the late preparatory period and the rigidation period were fixed with FAA fixative (ethanol/formalin/acetic acid = 16:6:1) for longer than 24 h and preserved in 70% EtOH for observations by SEM. The samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of EtOH and dried using a critical point dryer (Samdri-PVT-3D; Tousimis, Rockville, MD, USA). Dried samples were then coated with gold ions with an E-1010 Ion Sputter (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Ion-coated samples were observed by SEM (JSM-5510LV; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). To histologically observe the inner structures of the tail ends, paraffin sections were made according to the method described in previous studies [47]. Juveniles in the late preparatory period and the rigidation period were fixed in Bouin’s solution (saturated aqueous picric acid solution/formalin/acetic acid = 15:5:1) [48] for longer than 24 h and preserved in 70% EtOH until use. The specimens were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, then transferred into xylene, and finally embedded into paraffin. Serial sections (8–10 μm thick) were prepared with a microtome (Spencer Lens Co., Buffalo, NY, USA) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Tissues on slides were observed using an optical microscope (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and photographs were taken using a digital camera (DP74; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) attached to the microscope. To observe detailed inner structures forming under old cuticles, transparentizing and autofluorescence scanning methods were applied toN. nodulosaaccording to the method described in previous studies [49,50]. Juveniles were fixed in FAA for 2–3 h and preserved in 70% EtOH. To transparentize the samples, they were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of methanol, then sunk into BABB solution (benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate = 1:2) overnight at room temperature. Transparentized samples were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV3000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) by irradiating four wavelengths of light: 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm. Digital images were processed with software GIMP-2.10 (https://www.gimp.org/). Some images photographed with the digital camera (EOS 8000D) were stacked by using imaging software (Zerene Stucker; Zerene Systems, Washington, USA). The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. Hughes CL, Kaufman TC.

Previously, it was thought that when a millipede molts (sheds its exoskeleton), it grows new segments on the end of its body without legs. Then after the next molt, the previously new segments re-emerge with fully formed legs attached. However, a team at the University of Tokyo has found that new segments actually contain tiny bundles of legs, which appear as transparent protrusions before molting and then become fully formed afterwards. This discovery could help us understand how not only millipedes, but also other arthropods (invertebrates with jointed legs) grow.
If you’ve recently been for a picnic in the park, you’ll probably have had to contend with a few creepy-crawlies. One that you might come across trundling under a shady tree is the harmless millipede. Famous for its multitude of legs (though the first to have more than 1,000 was actually only discovered in 2021), it is thought to have been one of the first creatures to walk on land and breathe air about 420 million years ago. Their lifestyle of burrowing in the dirt and digesting decomposing plant matter means that they play a very important role in our ecosystems, but there is still a lot we don’t know about them, including exactly how they get all those famous legs.
“In 1855, French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre proposed the ‘law of anamorphosis.’ That law indicated a pattern in millipede growth, in which legless segments are first added to the body by molting and then legs are added onto that segment in the next molt. However, the physical changes that occur when segments and legs are added were not clear,” explained Professor Toru Miura from the Graduate School of Science at the University of Tokyo. “Our study is significant in that it adds new morphological knowledge to the law of anamorphosis after 168 years.”
Researchers used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to study a common species of millipede calledNiponia nodulosa, during different stages of molting and growth. This technique enabled them to view microscopic surface details on the bodies of the millipedes and look for any changes. The team also used another microscope called a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) to look at what was happening inside the millipedes. “We expected that segments and legs would be added by molting, as happens in many other arthropods. However, we were surprised to find that drastic morphogenesis, the biological process of changing shape, actually startedbeforemolting,” said Miura.
When scanning the millipedes just a few days before molting, the team could already see two pairs of small, wrinkled legs under the cuticle of the legless segment. Just before the millipede molted, transparent protrusions containing the new bundle of legs were observed on the outer surface of the segment, covered by a thin tissue membrane. “Arthropods generally undergo morphological changes through molting, but the phenomenon discovered in this study deviates from this. With these millipedes at least, transparent protrusions with legs appeared from the elastic cuticle (an external layer that provides muscular support) before they molted,” said Miura. “This result suggests that changing shape without molting via the cuticle may also be important in other arthropods.”
As arthropods make up about 75% of all animal life on Earth, it was significant to the researchers that a familiar animal like the millipede could provide a new and important insight into its development and diversity. “Since it is not yet known whether this phenomenon is widely seen in other millipedes, we will need to study other species for comparison. We would also like to continue our research into the molecular mechanisms involved in anamorphosis, as these are still largely unclear,” said Miura. “Our work has shown us that there are still many surprising discoveries to be made in nature, right under our feet.”

This material can travel vast distances and for extremely long periods of time. In theory this material could contain direct or indirect signs of life from the host world, such as fossils of microorganisms. And this material could be detectable by humans in the near future, or even now.
When you hear the words vacuum and dust in a sentence, you may groan at the thought of having to do the housework. But in astronomy, these words have different connotations. Vacuum of course refers to the void of space. Dust, however, means diffuse solid material floating through space. It can be an annoyance to some astronomers as it may hinder their views of some distant object. Or dust could be a useful tool to help other astronomers learn about something distant without having to leave the safety of our own planet. Professor Tomonori Totani from the University of Tokyo’s Department of Astronomy has an idea for space dust that might sound like science fiction but actually warrants serious consideration.
“I propose we study well-preserved grains ejected from other worlds for potential signs of life,” said Totani. “The search for life outside our solar system typically means a search for signs of communication, which would indicate intelligent life but precludes any pre-technological life. Or the search is for atmospheric signatures that might hint at life, but without direct confirmation there could always be an explanation that does not require life. However, if there are signs of life in dust grains, not only could we be certain, but we could also find out soon.”
The basic idea is that large asteroid strikes can eject ground material into space. There is a chance that recently deceased or even fossilized microorganisms could be contained in some rocky material in this ejecta. This material will vary in size greatly, with different-sized pieces behaving differently once in space. Some larger pieces might fall back down or enter permanent orbits around a local planet or star. And some much smaller pieces might be too small to contain any verifiable signs of life. But grains in the region of 1 micrometer (one-thousandth of a millimeter) could not only host a specimen of a single-celled organism, but they could also potentially escape their host solar system altogether, and under the right circumstances, maybe even venture to ours.
“My paper explores this idea using available data on the different aspects of this scenario,” said Totani. “The distances and times involved can be vast, and both reduce the chance any ejecta containing life signs from another world could even reach us. Add to that the number of phenomena in space that can destroy small objects due to heat or radiation, and the chances get even lower. Despite that, I calculate around 100,000 such grains could be landing on Earth every year. Given there are many unknowns involved, this estimate could be too high or too low, but the means to explore it already exist so it seems like a worthwhile pursuit.”
There may be such grains already on Earth, and in plentiful amounts, preserved in places such as the Antarctic ice, or under the seafloor. Space dust in these places could be retrieved relatively easily, but discerning extrasolar material from material originating in our own solar system is still a complex matter. If the search is extended to space itself, however, there are already missions that capture dust in the vacuum using ultralight materials called aerogels.

How birds got their wings,"Advertisement Zoological Lettersvolume9, Article number:4(2023)Cite this article 10kAccesses 2Citations 585Altmetric Metricsdetails Avian wings as organs for aerial locomotion are furnished with a highly specialized musculoskeletal system compared with the forelimbs of other tetrapod vertebrates. Among the specializations, the propatagium, which accompanies a skeletal muscle spanning between the shoulder and wrist on the leading edge of the wing, represents an evolutionary novelty established at a certain point in the lineage toward crown birds. However, because of the rarity of soft-tissue preservation in the fossil record, the evolutionary origin of the avian propatagium has remained elusive. Here we focus on articulated skeletons in the fossil record to show that angles of elbow joints in fossils are indicators of the propatagium in extant lineages of diapsids (crown birds and non-dinosaurian diapsids), and then use this relationship to narrow down the phylogenetic position acquiring the propatagium to the common ancestor of maniraptorans. Our analyses support the hypothesis that the preserved propatagium-like soft tissues in non-avian theropod dinosaurs (oviraptorosaurianCaudipteryxand dromaeosaurianMicroraptor) are homologous with the avian propatagium, and indicate that all maniraptoran dinosaurs likely possessed the propatagium even before the origin of flight. On the other hand, the preserved angles of wrist joints in non-avian theropods are significantly greater than those in birds, suggesting that the avian interlocking wing-folding mechanism involving the ulna and radius had not fully evolved in non-avian theropods. Our study underscores that the avian wing was acquired through modifications of preexisting structures including the feather and propatagium. Birds possess a suite of characteristics prerequisite for powered flight. The fossil record suggests that the evolutionary processes leading to avian characteristics such as the feather [1,2], pulmonary air-sac system [3], brain shape [4], and small genome size [5], had proceeded in non-avian dinosaurs, namely, prior to the origin of powered flight. The avian wing evolved through modification of the forelimb of bipedal theropod dinosaurs. Evolutionary changes in forelimb skeletal morphology had occurred not only in the early evolution of the wing (i.e., amongArchaeopteryxand more crownward stem birds) but had also accumulated along the non-avian grade of the phylogeny, particularly in non-avian paravians [6]. In this evolutionary process, the morphology of the wrist joint has attracted attention in paleontology, and previous studies revealed that the birds inherited the large flexion of the wrist joint from non-avian theropods [7,8,9,10], although the configuration of carpal skeletal elements at the wrist joint had not been conserved during theropod evolution [11,12]. On the other hand, the orientation of the glenoid on the scapulocoracoid changed after the origin of the avian wing, eventually reducing the energy required for the muscles around the shoulder joint during flapping by the function of the acrocoracohumeral ligament [13]. These skeletal aspects of theropod forelimb evolution imply that the basic skeletal design necessary for the early evolution of powered flight had gradually acquired in both non-avian and stem avian theropod grades. Although the arrangement of the skeletal muscles changed during the evolution of the avian wing, homologous muscles are mostly identifiable between birds and the other extant diapsids [14,15,16,17]. Indeed, the basal theropodTawa hallaelikely possessed most of the skeletal muscles on the forelimb seen in birds [17]. However, there is an exception: the propatagial muscle. Within the propatagium (Fig.1A) of the avian wing, the propatagial muscle (musculus propatagialis) spans between the shoulder girdle and wrist (Fig.1B) [14,15,16,18]. This structure constitutes the leading edge of the wing and represents an evolutionary novelty in birds. In some species of birds, most of the propatagial muscle is “tendinous” for most of its length, thus has often been called the “propatagial tendon” [19,20]. Musculoskeletal system of the avian left wing in ventral view.A,B, Propatagium (A) and forelimb muscles (B).C,D, Synchronous actions between the elbow and wrist joints, at an extension via the function of themusculus (m.) propatagialis(C) and at a flexion via the interlocking wing-folding system (D) In extant birds, at the extension of the elbow joint, the propatagial muscle/tendon synchronously causes the extension of the wrist joint, while keeping the elbow joint at an angle (Fig.1C) [19,20,21]. In addition to this structure, extant birds have an interlocking wing-folding mechanism, in which the sliding movement of the ulna and radius causes the folding of the wrist at the flexion of the elbow joint (Fig.1D) [19,20]. These synchronized actions of the elbow and wrist joints facilitate the control of wing flapping with only a small volume of muscles in the distal part of the wing. On the other hand, ratites as non-volant birds lack the propatagial structure [14,22,23], being consistent with its functional relationship to specific movements of forelimbs. From this functional point of view, some studies have discussed the evolutionary origin of the propatagium in the lineage towards birds [10,24,25,26,27]. Although soft-tissue preservation of putative propatagia has been reported for two non-avian theropod species—Microraptor gui(Fig.2A) [28] andCaudipteryxsp. (Fig.2B) [29]—such evidence is absent from some other non-avian theropods with soft-tissue preservation (e.g.,Sinosauropteryx[30]). However, considering the rarity of soft-tissue preservation, information regarding the early evolution of the propatagium is currently very limited. Also, it may be difficult to identify an osteological correlate, or a muscle attachment site, of the propatagial muscle in fossil skeletons, because this muscle is thin, unlike the other major wing muscles. Therefore, it is substantially impractical to infer the evolution of the propatagial muscle based only on typical morphological analyses. Soft-tissue preservations of putative propatagia in non-avian theropods.AMicroraptor gui(IVPP V 13352).B–D,Caudipteryxsp.

Broken lines inDindicate missing borders of the soft tissues. d1–3, digits 1–3; f, feather; g, gastralium; ppt, propatagium; r, radius; u, ulna Unlike soft-tissue preservation, the vertebrate fossil record is relatively rich in preserved articulated skeletons, and the preserved postures of those articulated fossils may reflect morphologies of soft tissues [10,31]. Because of the restricted movements through the propatagial muscle and skeletal interlocking wing-folding mechanism in wings of extant birds (Fig.1C, D), the angles of these joints preserved in fossils are expected to fall within a certain range. In particular, the elbow joint in species with a propatagium should not be extended beyond a certain angle in articulated fossil skeletons, because the propatagium restricts the range of the elbow-joint angle in life (Fig.1C). On the other hand, it is likely that the angles of elbow and wrist joints would be preserved at random in fossils of species devoid of the propatagial structure. Indeed, these postulates on joint angles preserved in articulated skeletons have been addressed in discussions about the evolution of the propatagium in some previous studies [24,27]. However, there is ample room for analyses of the relationship between the propatagium and preserved posture, particularly in the birds with a propatagium, before reconstructing the evolutionary process. In this study, we first tested our prediction about the relationship between the propatagium and preserved posture, using fossils of Cenozoic crown-group birds possessing the propatagium and Mesozoic–Cenozoic non-dinosaurian diapsids lacking the propatagium, and demonstrated that the angle of the elbow joint preserved in an articulated fossil skeleton is an indicator of the presence or absence of the propatagium. Second, we measured the joint angles in articulated fossil skeletons of Mesozoic theropods (both non-avian and stem avian) to infer the evolutionary process of the propatagium and the skeletal interlocking wing-folding mechanism. In this study, we collected data about the joint angles in articulated fossil skeletons from previously published images (Table S1). Here, our subjects for measurement were specimens in which all joints of the forelimb are completely articulated: we did not examine fossils wherein only an elbow or a wrist articulation was preserved. When multiple specimens were available for a species, we used a mean value of each joint angle as representative for the species. For an individual with the articulations of both (right and left) forelimbs preserved, the larger value was used as representative for the individual, because the angle of the elbow joint is expected not to exceed a certain value in the presence of the propatagium in our prediction. Angles of the elbow and wrist joints of fossils were measured in ImageJ 1.52a software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) using the “Angle” tool. For the fossil specimens ofMicroraptor gui(IVPP V 13352) andCaudipteryxsp. (IVPP V 12430), direct observations were also conducted for this study. First, we measured the preserved joint angles of the forelimbs in fossils of crown birds from the Cenozoic, which unequivocally possessed the propatagium, and in fossils of non-dinosaurian diapsids (i.e., a paraphyletic category) from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic (Table S2). Because the latter taxa belonged to the lineages leading toward the extant groups of non-avian diapsids, they serve as representatives lacking the propatagial muscle, while possessing the other forelimb muscles present in the crown birds. Next, we measured the elbow- and wrist-joint angles preserved in articulated fossil skeletons of the Mesozoic theropods (Table S2). Here, to examine large-scale taphonomic trends rather than species-level trends, non-avian theropods were divided into six taxonomic categories (grades): non-dinosaurian diapsids (C0), non-coelurosaurian theropods (C1), non-maniraptoran coelurosaurs (C2), non-paravian maniraptorans (C3), non-avialan paravians (C4), non-pygostylian avialans (C5), pygostylians (C6), and crown birds (C7). To evaluate differences in angles among taxonomic categories, we conducted one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in RStudio (2021.09.1 Build 372) (https://www.rstudio.com). To check for any significance in the difference between neighboring taxonomic categories, as well as crown birds and non-dinosaurian diapsids, we performed the Wilcoxon rank sum test in RStudio. In addition, to evaluate the trends in preserved joint angles along the phylogeny, which was based on the topologies of previous analyses [32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41], parsimony-based ancestral state reconstructions for continuous characters were performed using Mesquite v.3.70 [42]. Comparisons between elbow-joint angles of the crown birds (n= 35) and non-dinosaurian diapsids (n= 71) showed a significant difference (p< 0.001). The median values of elbow angles in the non-dinosaurian diapsids and crown birds were 137.9 and 31.3 degrees, respectively (Fig.3A). Although the entire ranges of elbow-joint angles of these two categories overlapped at 31.7–92.0 degrees, the interquartile ranges were separated: the interquartile range for the crown birds fell below 50.2 degrees, whereas that for the non-dinosaurian diapsids fell above 111.0 degrees (Fig.3A). The 95% confidence intervals (mean ± 1.96SE) of the elbow-joint angles were 131.0 ± 8.2 degrees for the non-dinosaurian diapsids and 40.2 ± 8.4 degrees for the crown birds. Comparison of preserved elbow and wrist-joint angles between the non-dinosaurian diapsids and crown birds.AElbow-joint angles.BWrist-joint angles. Measurements were obtained from 71 non-dinosaurian diapsid and 35 crown bird articulated fossil skeletons In addition, there was a significant difference between the angles of the wrist joints in these two categories (p< 0.001). The median values of the wrist-joint angles in the non-dinosaurian diapsids and crown birds were 159.5 and 52.2 degrees, respectively (Fig.3B). Accordingly, the elbow- and wrist-joint angles preserved in fossil skeletons differ significantly (p< 0.001) between these two taxonomic categories, those possessing and those lacking the propatagium, respectively. As expected, the joint angles of the crown birds were smaller than those of the non-dinosaurian diapsids. Among non-avian theropods, a significant difference in average elbow-joint angle was detected by one-way ANOVA (p< 0.001). We therefore performed the Wilcoxon rank sum test to test for significant differences between neighboring taxonomic categories in phylogenetic order. The median values of elbow-joint angles in the six categories (C1–C6) between the non-dinosaurian diapsids (C0) and crown birds (C7) are shown in Table1. A significant difference in elbow-joint angle was detected between C3 (non-paravian maniraptorans) and C4 (non-avialan paravians) (p< 0.05). Also, to observe the trends in preserved joint angles in the Mesozoic theropod lineage without focusing on taxonomic categories (C1–C6), we mapped the measured elbow-joint angles onto the phylogeny, and conducted an ancestral state reconstruction based on maximum parsimony (Fig. S1). The result showed that elbow-joint angles decreased along the roots of the Maniraptora and Paraves, thereby being consistent with the statistical analyses of C1–C6. Elbow-joint angles remained small (< 110 degrees) among the Maniraptora. The averages of wrist-joint angles were also significantly different among taxonomic categories C0–C7, according to one-way ANOVA (p< 0.001). The median values of wrist-joint angles are shown in Table1. The Wilcoxon rank sum test detected a significant difference between C0 (non-dinosaurian diapsids) and C1 (non-coelurosaurian theropods), between C1 and C2 (non-maniraptoran coelurosaurs), and between C5 (non-pygostylian avialans) and C6 (pygostylians) (p< 0.05). With the measured wrist-joint angles mapped onto the phylogeny, the ancestral state reconstruction showed that the preserved wrist-joint angles tended to decrease along the phylogeny almost concomitant with the decreases in the preserved elbow-joint angles (Fig. S2). However, there is a difference in the phylogenetic positions that eventually show joint angles comparable to those of the crown birds: the preserved elbow-joint angles became small in the Maniraptora, whereas the preserved wrist-joint angles decreased greatly after the divergence ofJeholornis. Our direct observations of the fossil specimens ofMicroraptor gui(IVPP V 13352) andCaudipteryxsp. (IVPP V 12430) confirmed that soft tissues comparable to the propatagia are preserved on their forelimbs (Fig.2). In IVPP V 13352 (M. gui) the putative propatagia are separated from the other soft tissues (Fig.2A). On the other hand, the boundary between the soft tissue surrounding the forelimb and that surrounding the trunk is unclear in IVPP V 12430 (C.sp.) (Fig.2B). However, our detailed observation revealed that the soft tissue surrounding the first digit is contiguous with a soft tissue being endowed with a fibrous structure spread wide from the radial side of the forelimb (Fig.2C, D). Thus, at least the soft tissue spreading from the forearm is distinguishable from the other parts and likely represent the soft tissue comparable to the propatagium, although the possibility that a part of the soft tissue along the upper arm corresponds to the trunk tissues cannot be excluded. In this study, we analyzed modes of preservation of forelimb postures in articulated fossils. Since each species is mostly represented by a single fossil specimen preserving only a variable posture within the range allowed by the soft-tissue anatomy, species-level macroevolutionary trends are out of the scope of our analyses. Nevertheless, origins of evolutionary novelties of soft tissue including the propatagium can change allowable ranges of preserved posture, and such transitions affect taphonomic trends along phylogeny at higher taxonomic level. Statistical analyses demonstrated that elbow-joint angles preserved in fossils of crown birds are smaller than those preserved in fossils of non-dinosaurian diapsids. The presence of the propatagium in the crown birds represents the major difference between these two categories. We can exclude the possibility that the skeletal interlocking wing (forelimb)-folding mechanism seen in the crown birds was associated with the difference in elbow-joint angle, because the decreases in angles of the elbow and wrist joints along the Mesozoic theropod phylogeny preserved in fossils were not synchronous. In other words, in some “intermediate” forms between the non-dinosaurian diapsids and crown birds, the elbow and wrist joints were likely not interlocked via the ulna and radius, while the elbow-joint angle remained small. Therefore, the angles of elbow joints preserved in articulated fossil skeletons should be an indicator of the presence or absence of the propatagium. Based on this relationship between the presence of the propatagium and the elbow-joint angles preserved in fossils, the presence of the propatagium can be inferred in non-avian dinosaurs, which are phylogenetically bracketed by the crown birds and non-dinosaurian diapsids, even if there is no indication of soft tissue (propatagium) in the fossils. It can be safely said that species with preserved elbow-joint angles within the interquartile range of non-dinosaurian diapsids (i.e., larger than 111.0 degrees) did not possess the propatagium. On the basis of this indicator, we mapped the fossil taxa lacking the propatagium onto the phylogenetic framework, along with the taxa showing soft-tissue preservations of putative propatagia (Caudipteryxsp. andMicroraptor gui) (Fig.2), and conducted an ancestral state reconstruction (Fig.4). The result demonstrated that the propatagium had not evolved in non-maniraptoran theropods (C1), whereas it is not inconsistent with the scenario that the Maniraptora globally possessed the propatagium. Since the range of preserved elbow-joint angles began to change at the origin of the Maniraptora (Fig. S1), it is likely that the evolutionary origin of the propatagium dates back to the origin of Maniraptora, and that the propatagia ofCaudipteryxsp. andMicroraptor guiwere homologous (even in the strict sense) with the avian propatagium. Our analyses also detected a decrease in range of preserved elbow-joint angles in the lineage towards the Paraves, suggesting the propatagium became highly developed in the Paraves. Evolutionary process of the propatagium. The evolutionary process of the propatagium was inferred based on the elbow-joint angles preserved in fossils (evidence for absence) and soft-tissue preservation (evidence for presence) Among non-avian theropods, the range of preserved angles of the elbow and wrist joints decreased at different points along the phylogeny (Figs. S1, S2). The range of preserved wrist-joint angles are large compared to those of the crown birds in non-pygostylian maniraptorans, which likely possessed the propatagium (Figs. S1, S2). This mode of preservation seen in non-pygostylian maniraptorans (C4, 5) can be explained by the possibility that these species extended the wrist joint toward the radial side when grasping items such as prey. In this scenario, the skeletal interlocking wing (forelimb)-folding system seen in the crown birds was absent in this “intermediate” morphotype possessing the propatagium (Fig.5), and first evolved among the Pygostylia, in which the grasping capability was not required. This interpretation is consistent with a previous study on the evolution of the wrist skeletal morphology suggesting that the same skeletal architecture of the wrist as in the crown birds first evolved in the clade more crownward thanSapeornis[11].

The propatagium was present, while the wrist could extend toward the radial side in a grasping movement.BSapeornis chaoyangensiswith the avian interlocking wing-folding system In this study, we demonstrated that elbow-joint angles preserved in articulated fossil skeletons can be indicators of the presence or absence of the propatagium. Based on this relationship, it is likely that the propatagium first evolved within the Maniraptora. On the other hand, the decrease in preserved wrist-joint angle was observed at a phylogenetic position more derived than that of the decrease in elbow-joint angle, suggesting an “intermediate” morphotype possessing the propatagium on forelimbs used for grasping, rather than for flying.

Part ofSpringer Nature.","Modern birds capable of flight all have a specialized wing structure called the propatagium without which they could not fly. The evolutionary origin of this structure has remained a mystery, but new research suggests it evolved in nonavian dinosaurs. The finding comes from statistical analyses of arm joints preserved in fossils and helps fill some gaps in knowledge about the origin of bird flight.
For a long time now, we have known modern birds evolved from certain lineages of dinosaurs that lived millions of years ago. This has led researchers to look to dinosaurs to explain some of the features unique to birds, for example, feathers, bone structure and so on. But there’s something special about the wings of birds in particular that piqued the interest of researchers at the University of Tokyo’s Department of Earth and Planetary Science.
“At the leading edge of a bird’s wing is a structure called the propatagium, which contains a muscle connecting the shoulder and wrist that helps the wing flapping and makes bird flight possible,” said Associate Professor Tatsuya Hirasawa. “It’s not found in other vertebrates, and it’s also found to have disappeared or lost its function in flightless birds, one of the reasons we know it’s essential for flight. So, in order to understand how flight evolved in birds, we must know how the propatagium evolved. This is what prompted us to explore some distant ancestors of modern birds, theropod dinosaurs.”
Theropod dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex and Velociraptor, had arms not wings. If the scientists could find evidence of an early example of the propatagium in these dinosaurs, it would help explain how the modern avian branch of the tree of life transitioned from arms to wings. However, it’s not so simple, as the propatagium is made up of soft tissues which do not fossilize well, if at all, so direct evidence might not be possible to find. Instead, the researchers had to find an indirect way to identify the presence or lack of a propatagium in a specimen.
“The solution we came up with to assess the presence of a propatagium was to collect data about the angles of joints along the arm, or wing, of a dinosaur or bird,” said Yurika Uno, a graduate student at Hirasawa's lab. “In modern birds, the wings cannot fully extend due to the propatagium, constraining the range of angles possible between connecting sections. If we could find a similarly specific set of angles between joints in dinosaur specimens, we can be fairly sure they too possessed a propatagium. And through quantitative analyses of the fossilized postures of birds and nondinosaurs, we found the telltale ranges of joint angles we hoped to.”
Based on this clue, the team found that the propatagium likely evolved in a group of dinosaurs known as the maniraptoran theropods, including the famous Velociraptor. This was backed up when the researchers identified the propatagium in preserved soft tissue fossils, including those of the feathered oviraptorosaurian Caudipteryx and winged dromaeosaurian Microraptor. All the specimens they found it in existed prior to the evolution of flight in that lineage.
This research means it’s now known when the propatagium came into being, and it leads researchers on to the next question of how it came to be. Why these particular theropod species needed such a structure to better adapt to their environment might be a harder question to answer. The team has already begun exploring possible connections between the fossil evidence and embryonic development of modern vertebrates to see if that will shed any light on it. The team also thinks some theropods might have evolved the propatagium not because of any pressure to learn to fly, as their forelimbs were made for grasping objects and not for flying.
“Dinosaurs portrayed in popular media are becoming more and more accurate,” said Hirasawa. “At least now we get to see features like feathers, but I hope we can see an even more up-to-date representation soon where theropods have their propatagium too.”

The switch made from a single molecule,"Single-molecule electron sources of fullerenes driven via constant electric fields, approximately 1 nm in size, produce peculiar emission patterns, such as a cross or a two-leaf pattern. By illuminating the electron sources with femtosecond light pulses, we discovered that largely modulated emission patterns appeared from single molecules. Our simulations revealed that emission patterns, which have been an intractable question for over seven decades, represent single-molecule molecular orbitals. Furthermore, the observed modulations originated from variations of single-molecule molecular orbitals, practically achieving the subnanometric optical modulation of an electron source.

By using a carefully tuned laser pulse, the researchers are able to use fullerene to switch the path of an incoming electron in a predictable way. This switching process can be three to six orders of magnitude faster than switches in microchips, depending on the laser pulses used. Fullerene switches in a network could produce a computer beyond what is possible with electronic transistors, and they could also lead to unprecedented levels of resolution in microscopic imaging devices.
Over 70 years ago, physicists discovered that molecules emit electrons in the presence of electric fields, and later on, certain wavelengths of light. The electron emissions created patterns that enticed curiosity but eluded explanation. But this has changed thanks to a new theoretical analysis, the ramification of which could not only lead to new high-tech applications, but also improve our ability to scrutinize the physical world itself. Project Researcher Hirofumi Yanagisawa and his team theorized how the emission of electrons from excited molecules of fullerene should behave when exposed to specific kinds of laser light, and when testing their predictions, found they were correct.
“What we’ve managed to do here is control the way a molecule directs the path of an incoming electron using a very short pulse of red laser light,” said Yanagisawa. “Depending on the pulse of light, the electron can either remain on its default course or be redirected in a predictable way. So, it’s a little like the switching points on a train track, or an electronic transistor, only much faster. We think we can achieve a switching speed 1 million times faster than a classical transistor. And this could translate to real world performance in computing. But equally important is that if we can tune the laser to coax the fullerene molecule to switch in multiple ways at the same time, it could be like having multiple microscopic transistors in a single molecule. That could increase the complexity of a system without increasing its physical size.”
The fullerene molecule underlying the switch is related to the perhaps slightly more famous carbon nanotube, though instead of a tube, fullerene is a sphere of carbon atoms. When placed on a metal point — essentially the end of a pin — the fullerenes orientate a certain way so they will direct electrons predictably. Fast laser pulses on the scale of femtoseconds, quadrillionths of a second, or even attoseconds, quintillionths of a second, are focused on the fullerene molecules to trigger the emission of electrons. This is the first time laser light has been used to control the emission of electrons from a molecule in this way.
“This technique is similar to the way a photoelectron emission microscope produces images,” said Yanagisawa. “However, those can achieve resolutions at best around 10 nanometers, or ten-billionths of a meter. Our fullerene switch enhances this and allows for resolutions of around 300 picometers, or three-hundred-trillionths of a meter.”
In principle, as multiple ultrafast electron switches can be combined into a single molecule, it would only take a small network of fullerene switches to perform computational tasks potentially much faster than conventional microchips. But there are several hurdles to overcome, such as how to miniaturize the laser component, which would be essential to create this new kind of integrated circuit. So, it may still be many years before we see a fullerene switch-based smartphone.

The surprising similarities of packed particles,"We introduce a model for particles that are extremely polydisperse in size compared with monodisperse and bidisperse systems. In two dimensions (2D), size polydispersity inhibits crystallization and increases the packing fraction at jamming points. However, no packing pattern common to diverse polydisperse particles has been reported. We focused on polydisperse particles with a power size distributionr−aas a ubiquitous system that can be expected to be scale invariant. We experimentally and numerically constructed 2D random packing for various polydisperse particles with different size exponentsa. Analysis of the packing pattern revealed a common contact number distribution fora<3and a higher jamming point for2<a<3than in monodisperse systems. These findings demonstrate that the ambiguity of the characteristic length provides common properties that lead to a classification scheme for polydisperse particles.

Typically, in situations where space is constrained, jams can occur, and understanding this can be useful in various industries. However, only instances where the particles in question are similar or have a limited range of sizes have been successfully modeled. For the first time, a model has been made that describes bodies of particles with highly diverse sizes, and in different jamming scenarios.
If you’ve ever put a bunch of balls in a box, you probably noticed the amount of wasted space between them all, especially if they’re all the same size. But the more varied the sizes of the balls, the more of that wasted space can be filled, due to the presence of smaller ones that can fill the gaps between larger ones. There is an intuitive obviousness to this situation, but as is often the case with such things, it’s surprisingly difficult to model the way this actually happens. And the less regular the packing objects, or particles, become, the harder it is to know how they will behave in a given physical scenario.
For the first time, researchers from the Komaba Institute for Science at the University of Tokyo have identified a structure that commonly appears when particles with extreme size variation are randomly packed together, regardless of their size distribution. This kind of model can be extremely useful to people whose work involves the movement, separation or mixing of particulate matter. For example, the construction industry works with stones, sand, cement; the medical industry uses biomolecules, powders, oil droplets; food manufacturers pack grains, seeds, fruits; and so on, the list is extensive.
“When I thought about what might be happening inside a packed collection of mixed particles, it made me want to explore this experimentally. One of the challenges to doing this, though, lies in how to make an idealized sample of packing particles,” said Associate Professor Miho Yanagisawa. “In our experiment, droplets of oil in water were repeatedly fractured to break them up in an ordered way. This yielded particle sizes which followed a mathematical pattern called a power distribution. Essentially a very broad range of sizes, this was important so that no one size range would be overrepresented in our results. The droplets were gently compressed between two glass plates; this constrained them to a two-dimensional surface and prevented them from overlapping vertically, which was critical for our imaging analysis.”
When identical particles are constrained in two dimensions, they will form a hexagonal lattice. But if size varies, or are said to be polydisperse, this structural symmetry is broken. However, Yanagisawa and fellow researcher Daisuke Shimamoto found that there actually is a common structure of randomly packed particles with extreme size variation; it’s just not obvious by looking at it. This model is statistical rather than geometric and describes the distribution of particles of different sizes as they jam together. An extremely useful implication of this is that the right conditions of particle size variation that allow for denser packing can be modeled, which could mean less wasted space in applications where spatial efficiency is important.
“Although diversity and universality seem to be contradictory concepts, this study shows diversity can produce universality,” said Yanagisawa. “In fact, diverse size distributions are common in nature. Therefore, even phenomena that appear to be very diverse at first look may have a hidden universality, or universality can be revealed by considering the particle distribution of the system as a whole.”

Their potential as effective organisms for producing useful substances is also of interest in bioindustry. Although genomic information is indispensable for elucidating metabolism and promoting molecular breeding, many ultrasmall algae remain genetically uncharacterized. Here, we present the nuclear genome sequence of an ultrasmall green alga of freshwater habitats,Medakamo hakoo. Evolutionary analyses suggest that this species belongs to a new genus within the class Trebouxiophyceae. Sequencing analyses revealed that its genome, comprising 15.8 Mbp and 7629 genes, is among the smallest known genomes in the Viridiplantae. Its genome has relatively few genes associated with genetic information processing, basal transcription factors, and RNA transport. Comparative analyses revealed that 1263 orthogroups were shared among 15 ultrasmall algae from distinct phylogenetic lineages. The shared gene sets will enable identification of genes essential for algal metabolism and cellular functions. Microalgae are microscopic unicellular phytoplankton found in freshwater, seawater, and sediment, and are invisible to the naked eye1. Microalgae form the basis of the food chain in aquatic ecosystems, and play important roles in carbon dioxide capture and sequestration through photosynthesis2. Despite their ecological importance in providing energy to support all higher trophic levels, more than 70% of the species are estimated to remain unidentified3. Microalgae have been used to produce highly functional foods, biofuels, and materials used in cosmetics1. To improve the production efficiency and profitability of current algal culture systems, demand is increasing for especially small microalgae that can be cultured at high densities. We focused onMedakamo hakoo(Chlorophyta), an ultrasmall algal species found in freshwater that potentially may provide notable insights into genome biology of algae.Medakamo hakoowas first identified and reported in 20154. A previous study involving DNA staining revealed thatM. hakoolikely has the smallest known nucleus among Archaeplastida species5. Although some microalgae inhabiting seawater and hot springs have extremely simple genomes6,7,8,9,10, relatively few freshwater algae with extremely small genomes have been reported. Genomic analysis ofM. hakoois expected to produce useful information for future investigations on effective culture methods for optimal production of useful substances. Genomic information forM. hakoowill also contribute to understanding how eukaryotic phototrophs thrive in diverse environments. In addition, comparison of the genomes ofM. hakooand other ultrasmall algal species is an effective strategy for identifying the gene set common to algal species and genes common to green algal lineages. In this study, we first characterized the morphological features and synchronization of the cell cycle ofM. hakoo. Next, theM. hakoogenome sequence was assembled from long reads generated using the PacBio RSII system in conjunction with RNA-seq analysis of the transcriptome. Finally, comparison of the genomes ofM. hakooand 14 other microalgal species revealed thatM. hakoohas one of the smallest genomes among freshwater algae, and 1263 gene families conserved among microalgae were identified. To characterizeM. hakoomorphology, we first used SYBR Green I stain to labelM. hakoo,Cyanidioschyzon merolae, andSaccharomyces cerevisiaenuclei, and observed that the fluorescence intensity of theM. hakoonuclei was similar to that ofC. merolaeandS. cerevisiaenuclei (Fig.1a, b, Supplementary Fig.1).Cyanidioschyzon merolaeis an ultrasmall unicellular red alga with the smallest genome in Rhodophyta6,7. Fluorescence and transmission electron microscopic examination indicated thatM. hakoocells were approximately 1 µm in diameter and contained relatively few organelles, with only a single mitochondrion and chloroplast (Fig.1c–g, Supplementary Fig.2). Notably, a specific electron-dense structure in the nuclear peripheral region and thick cell walls were typical characteristics ofM. hakoocells (Fig.1f, Supplementary Fig.2d, e). Another structural feature observed inM. hakoocells was the accumulation of starch aggregates in the chloroplast (Supplementary Fig.2d). InC. merolae, starch aggregated in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig.2a, c). Additionally, phycobilisomes were undetectable inM. hakoochloroplasts (Fig.1f, Supplementary Fig.2). To examine theM. hakoocell division pattern, we cultured cells under a light–dark cycle to obtain highly synchronized cells, and detected the following cell-cycle stages: a single-cell stage (I), a two-cells-combined stage (II), a tetrad stage (III), and a dissection stage (IV) (Fig.1h, i, Supplementary Fig.3). In addition,M. hakoocells cultured in nitrogen-depleted medium typically formed lipid droplets, similar to the response of the oil-rich algaBotryococcus braunii(Supplementary Fig.4)11,12,13. aFluorescence images merged with a phase-contrast image ofM. hakoo(mh),Cyanidioschyzon merolae(cm), andSaccharomyces cerevisiae(sc).

From the long-read sequencing analysis, we obtained 18 contigs via a de novo sequence assembly (Table1, Supplementary Table1), of which two contigs were annotated as organellar genomes because they were circular sequences. To perform a phylogenetic analysis, we used theM. hakooorganellar genome, which we previously described14. A phylogenetic tree was constructed on the basis of plastid genome sequences from 62 chlorophyte taxa using the maximum-likelihood (ML) method (Fig.2a). The resulting tree suggested thatM. hakoois classifiable in the class Trebouxiophyceae. Additionally,M. hakoois likely evolutionarily related toB. braunii, which shows potential for algal fuel production15,16(Supplementary Fig.4). aPhylogeny of 62 chlorophytes inferred using a dataset comprising 15,561 amino acid positions in 79 cpDNA-encoded proteins. The best maximum-likelihood (ML) tree is presented, with support values at the nodes (the approximate likelihood-ratio test support/non-parametric bootstrap support values analyzed by IQ-TREE/posterior probability calculated using PhyloBayes). A lack of values at branches reflects 100% support from all analyses.bPhylogenetic relationships betweenM. hakooand 54 algal strains identified asChoricystisspecies in the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/),Choricystis parasiticaSAG 251-1 (NIES-1436), andMedakamo limneticacomb. nov. SAG 251-2 [=Choricystis limnetica18, according to the ML analysis of the chloroplast Rubisco large subunit gene (rbcL)]. Bootstrap values (50% or higher) for 1000 replications are presented at the branches. Branch lengths are proportional to the evolutionary distances indicated by the scale bar above the tree. In our phylogenetic analysis,MedakamoandChoricystisformed a small clade sister toBotryococcus(Fig.2a). Many algal strains originating from various freshwater habitats were recently identified asChoricystisspecies, and theirrbcLsequences are available in the NCBI database (e.g., Novis et al.17). In addition, threeChoricystisspecies were identified mainly on the basis of phylogenetic analyses by Pröschold and Darienko18. To more precisely resolve the phylogenetic relationships betweenMedakamoandChoricystis, 54Choricystis rbcLsequences in the NCBI database, two newrbcLsequences from strains studied by Pröschold and Darienko18, and theMedakamo rbcLsequence were included in a phylogenetic analysis, withBotryococcussequences as the outgroup (Fig.2b). The phylogenetic tree robustly resolved two sister clades (with bootstrap values of 83% or higher) that corresponded toChoricystisand the new genusMedakamo.MedakamocomprisesM. hakoosp. nov. andM. limneticacomb. nov. (=Choricystis limnetica) and can be clearly distinguished fromChoricystisand other freshwater green algae on the basis of their phylogenetic position and differences in cell morphology (Supplementary Note1). Thus,Medakamois recognized as a new genus within the class Trebouxiophyceae. The 16 non-organellar contigs were chromosomal sequences flanked by telomere sequences (5′-TTAGGG-3′). The total contig size was 15.8 Mb (Tables1,2), which was larger than the genome size estimated by fluorescence microscopy5. Thus, the contigs represented almost the complete genome sequence. Next, we validated the genome assembly by confirming several benchmarks. The sequence coverage of the assembly was 246.8×. To further evaluate the assembled genome, we conducted a Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) analysis19,20. After removing organellar contigs, 89.5% of the assembly comprised complete BUSCOs (Supplementary Fig.5). We also mapped RNA-seq reads to the contigs, with 98.6% of the reads successfully aligned. Moreover, tRNAs corresponding to all 20 amino acids were identified (Supplementary Table2). Using the BRAKER2 software21, we identified 7629 candidate protein-coding sequence (CDS) regions in the nucleus, and annotated these sequences using eggNOG-mapper22(Supplementary Data1) and GhostKOALA23(Supplementary Data2). Amino acid sequences were obtained for 91.0% of the complete BUSCOs (Supplementary Fig.5). A high G + C content (73 mol%) is one characteristic of theM. hakoogenome (Table2). The G + C content was high in protein-coding regions as well (Supplementary Table3). A high G + C content in the protein-coding regions may increase the number of certain types of amino acids in the resultant proteins (Fig.3a). We analyzed the amino acid composition of the predicted protein sequences inM. hakooand compared them with the amino acid composition in other microalgae. Our analysis demonstrated thatM. hakooproteins contained many alanine, glycine, and proline residues. More specifically, alanine was more abundant in theM. hakooproteome than in theC. merolaeproteome (Fig.3b). To investigate the relationship between gene expression and the G + C content in the CDSs, we plotted the G + C content and the transcripts per million (TPM) value for each gene (Fig.3c), which revealed a negative correlation between these two factors. A negative correlation was also detected between the alanine content and the TPM value for each gene (Fig.3d). These results suggested that highly expressed genes (e.g., housekeeping genes) were relatively unaffected by the bias toward a high G + C content in theM. hakoogenome. aCodon table.

We further analyzedM. hakooexpression patterns using proteomics, which detected more than 3000 unique peptides across samples (Supplementary Data3). All codons were represented in the proteins detected (Table3, Supplementary Fig.6), suggesting thatM. hakoocells use a standard codon table, with the caveat that mass spectrometry cannot distinguish between leucine and isoleucine residues. To determine the reason for the high G + C content in theM. hakoogenome, we examined the G + C content-related characteristics of the genome sequence. We focused on the guanine quadruplex (G4) structure, which is a non-B DNA structure that forms in guanine-abundant DNA regions24,25,26. The guanine nucleotides form a tetrad structure that is involved in various biological processes, including DNA replication, transcription, meiotic double-strand break, and telomere maintenance24,25,26. To predict the abundance of G4 in the genome ofM. hakooand other organisms, we used pqsfinder software, which can detect the G4 consensus sequence in DNA sequences27(Fig.3e). The frequency of the predicted G4 regions was highest inM. hakooamong the analyzed organisms. Notably, the frequency was higher than that inStreptomyces coelicolor, which has a genome with one of the highest G + C contents among prokaryotes. We compared theM. hakoogenome with previously sequenced genomes in terms of their size and gene number (Fig.4a; Table2). The genome ofM. hakoowas one of the smallest among Viridiplantae species and was smaller than that ofAuxenochlorella protothecoides, which has the smallest genome previously known among freshwater green algae (Fig.4a). We classified theM. hakoonuclear genes according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology28and determined the number of genes belonging to each functional group. First, we calculated the number of genes in the most enriched KEGG Orthology categories and compared the results with those for other green algae (Fig.4b). Overall,M. hakoohad fewer genes than the other examined species and, most notably, fewer genes belonging to the ‘Genetic information processing’ category. Next, we determined the number of genes annotated with specific pathways categorized as ‘Genetic information processing’. For many of these pathways,M. hakootended to have fewer genes compared with other green algal species (Fig.4c). On the basis of the gene sets, the pathways associated with ‘Basal transcription factors’ and ‘Nucleocytoplasmic transport’ were considerably simpler inM. hakoothan inOstreococcus lucimarinus, a marine green alga with a smaller genome thanM. hakoo(Fig.4c). aPlot of the protein-coding genes and the total genome size of plants.bNumber of green algae genes belonging to each KEGG Orthology category. The first-level classification was used for counting genes.cNumber of green algae genes belonging to the ‘Genetic information processing’ KEGG Orthology category. The third-level classification was used for counting genes. To more precisely determine the characteristics of theM. hakoogenome, we analyzed the conservation of genes associated with major biological pathways. Although almost all fundamental photosynthesis-related genes were conserved inM. hakoo, genes encoding stress-related light-harvesting complex (LHC)-like proteins (LHCSR) were not detected in theM. hakoogenome (Supplementary Figs.7,8). Regarding the photoreceptors,M. hakoohad cryptochrome and phototropin orthologs, but lacked a phytochrome homolog. Although several green algae have phytochromes29, their absence inM. hakoois consistent with the lack of phytochromes in the green algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii30and the red algaCyanidioschyzon merolae6. Our analysis also confirmed thatM. hakoohad a set of conserved canonical histones, including H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. However, we did not detect an ortholog of the linker histone H1 encoded in theM. hakoogenome. To confirm the conservation of other chromosomal proteins, we analyzed structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes (cohesin, condensin I/II, and SMC5/6), which are key regulators of chromosomal organization, dynamics, and stability31. Our analysis indicated that canonical components of all SMC complexes were conserved inM. hakoo(Supplementary Table4). Notably, relatively few nuclear envelope (NE)-related genes were identified in theM. hakoogenome. We investigated whether the NE-related genes were conserved inM. hakoo. The NE is composed of the outer nuclear membrane, the inner nuclear membrane, and the nuclear pore complex, which is mechanically supported by the nuclear lamina beneath the inner nuclear membrane32,33. We determined that the nuclear pore complex components (nucleoporins) were highly conserved, in contrast to other NE-related factors, which were minimally conserved. Only one ortholog of the mid-Sad1/UNC84 domain-containing protein (mid-SUN)34was a conserved inner nuclear membrane protein, and none of the outer nuclear membrane and nuclear lamina proteins were conserved. RNA interference (RNAi) is the molecular mechanism that regulates gene expression via small RNA and related proteins. Although RNAi-related proteins, such as Dicer and Argonaute, are widely conserved among eukaryotic organisms35,36, genes encoding these proteins were not detected in theM. hakoogenome. The genomes of microalgae, includingC. merolaeandO. tauri, also appear to have lost RNAi-related genes (Supplementary Table5). Autophagy involves the transport of a cytoplasmic cargo to the lysosome for degradation37. This mechanism is crucial for cell homeostasis because it allows the cell to recycle itself via the degradation of its components. However, no orthologs of autophagy-related genes are known in red algae38. By screening theM. hakoogenome, we identified conserved autophagy-related (ATG) genes (Supplementary Table6), including some that encode core ATG proteins required for autophagosome formation39. This indicates that the autophagy system is conserved in chlorophytes, but not in rhodophytes. For further analysis of the gene composition inM. hakooand other algae, we analyzed orthogroups ofM. hakooand 14 other algal species comprising 11 green algae (A. protothecoides,Bathycoccus prasinos,Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,Chlorella variabilis,Coccomyxa subellipsoidea,Micromonas commoda,Micromonas pusilla,Monoraphidium neglectum,O. lucimarinus,O. tauri, andVolvox carteri) and three red algae (Chondrus crispus,Cyanidioschyzon merolae, andGaldieria sulphuraria) with OrthoFinder40,41. The composition of each algal orthogroup is summarized in Supplementary Data4and the data were analyzed using principal component analysis (Fig.5a). The microalgal genomes were classifiable into several groups according to their orthogroup composition.Medakamo hakoobelonged to a group composed of trebouxiophycean algae (A. protothecoides,C. subellipsoidea, andC. variabilis) and had the smallest genome in this group. aPrincipal component analysis of the orthogroup composition of algal genomes.

Fifteen algae shown in Fig. 5a shared 1263 orthogroups, which were classified into the gene set conserved in eukaryotes (CE) and the algae-specific (AS) gene set.cGene expression of CE, AS, and theM. hakoo-specific gene sets. The edges of the boxplot indicate the first and third quartiles, and the center line indicates the median. The number of genes in the CE, AS and theM. hakoo-specific gene sets used in this analysis was 984, 279 and 2707, respectively. Brunner-Munzel test89with Bonferroni correction was used for comparison among gene sets.dGene ontology analysis of the complete genome and CE and AS gene sets.ePathway enrichment analysis of the AS gene set. The CE and AS gene sets were mapped to KEGG pathways. The mapped ratio of AS to CE genes was calculated for each pathway. Significantly enriched pathways (q-value < 0.05) are presented in different colors. Given thatM. hakoohad the smallest genome known among trebouxiophycean microalgae, we compared the orthogroups ofM. hakooand 14 microalgal species from other lineages to identify the gene set common to these microalgae (C15 gene set). We addedS. cerevisiaegene sets to the OrthoFinder analysis to divide the C15 gene set into the following two classes: genes typically conserved in eukaryotes (CE) gene set and algae-specific (AS) genes. The AS gene set was defined with a purposefully lenient criterion to maximally capture the potential diversity of microalgal orthologs. The 1263 orthogroups were classified into the C15 gene set, of which 984 and 279 orthogroups comprised the CE and AS gene sets, respectively (Fig.5b, Supplementary Data5). The CE and AS gene sets in theM. hakoogenome tended to be more highly expressed than the genes not included in these sets (Fig.5c, Supplementary Table7), indicating that the gene sets include many housekeeping genes. Next, we compared each gene set with theM. hakoogenome in terms of the proportion of genes assigned to particular KEGG Orthology categories, which revealed that the proportion of genes associated with metabolism was substantially higher in the AS gene set (Fig.5d). We also analyzed the enriched pathways in these gene sets. To evaluate the extent of the enrichment, we mapped the C15 and AS gene sets to KEGG pathways and calculated the ratio of the mapped genes in each pathway. We considered that a high ratio of AS genes to C15 genes indicated that the pathway strongly contributed to the characteristics of the AS gene set. The highly enriched pathways were associated with metabolism and photosynthesis (Fig.5e, Table4). Notably, the AS genes were mainly associated with pathways involved in secondary metabolism (Fig.5e, Table4). In this study, we revealed that the freshwater green algaM. hakoois an ultrasmall microalgae with cells 1 µm in diameter that can accumulate useful substances, including starch and lipids, and thus may be of utility for bioproduction. The most unique characteristic ofM. hakoois strong synchronization of the cell cycle under a light–dark cycle. Recently, it was shown that the key to maintaining dense algal cultures is to avoid clogging of the photosynthetic electron flow by appropriate regulation of the timing of light–dark cycles42. Thus, this attribute confers the potential to contribute to effective and stable bioproduction of useful substances with uniform quality1. In addition to these characteristics,M. hakoohas an extremely small genome. On the basis of the available information on Viridiplantae species in the KEGG Organisms database43and the JGI genome portal44,45,M. hakoolikely possesses one of the smallest genomes among freshwater Viridiplantae species. This finding suggests that maintaining a small genome and small cells is advantageous for survival, not only in seawater and extreme environments, but also in common freshwater environments. According to the package effect11,12,13, small cells are advantageous for photosynthesis. Although the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of ultrasmall cells remain unknown in microalgae, generic factors, such as photosynthetic efficiency, may have induced a decrease in genome size or suppressed genomic expansion. In green plants, LHCSR and PSBS are conserved LHC-like proteins with functions associated with non-photochemical quenching46. Although there is some uncertainty regarding the underlying molecular mechanism, LHCSR plays a major role in the dissipation of excess light energy inC. reinhardtii. Regarding land plants, both LHCSR and PSBS help to dissipate excess energy in the mossPhyscomitrium, butArabidopsis thalianalacks LHCSR and uses PSBS as a central component of its light energy dissipation machinery46. Additionally, PSBS is universally conserved in Viridiplantae, with the exception of bryopsidalean algae (OstreobiumandCaulerpa), which may have adapted to diverse light conditions47. InM. hakoo, the absence of LHCSR and the presence of the plastid genome-encoded cemA, which is required for the tolerance ofChlamydomonasto high-light stress48, suggest that this alga may have a unique high-light acclimation mechanism that may have convergently evolved in flowering plants and in an early-branching green alga (Chloropicon) (Supplementary Figs.7,8). TheM. hakoogenome does not contain a histone H1 gene CDS. Histone H1 includes the H15 domain, which is a globular domain comprising a winged-helix motif49. Green algae, includingChlorella sorokiniana50andHaematococcus lacustris51, and red algae, includingC. merolae6, have histone H1 orthologs or H15 domain-containing proteins. Similar toM. hakoo, the genome ofO. taurilacks a gene encoding a protein with the H15 domain8. Because the genes encoding SMC proteins, including those in condensin and cohesin, are conserved in these genomes, chromatin folding and chromosome condensation in these green algae occur without the linker histone H1. TheM. hakoogenome has a very high G + C content and abundant G4. The G4 structure, which is commonly located in telomere sequences but is also present within chromosomes, has diverse functions, including transcriptional and translational regulation. We speculate that a high frequency of the G4 consensus sequence is a characteristic of theM. hakoogenome, and G4-related biological processes may have contributed to the elevated genomic G + C content in this species during its evolution. Principal component analysis of the orthogroup composition ofM. hakooand 14 other microalgal species resolved multiple groups of species. Interestingly,M. hakooandOstreococcus, which have extremely small genomes, were placed in separate groups. This result indicates that ortholog compositions in microalgae are not dependent on the genome size but rather may reflect lineage-specific gene gains/losses. The AS gene set reflects well the genomic, metabolomic, and physiological characteristics of microalgae. For example, the AS gene set included those genes associated with terpenoid-related secondary metabolites. Carotenoids, one subgroup of tetraterpenoids, play a role as an antenna pigment for harvesting light and provide protection against oxidative stress52,53, which is beneficial for human health. Large-scale production of carotenoids for health-related industries using microalgae is flourishing54. The AS gene set determined in the current study provides information relevant for bioengineering of microalgae. In addition to theM. hakoogenome described in this study, the availability of genome sequences for a broad range of other ultrasmall algae would provide a foundation to identify the minimal conserved gene set of plants (algae and land plants), and to understand how photosynthetic eukaryotes thrive in diverse environments. Medakamo hakoo311 was obtained from the personal aquarium of Prof. Kuroiwa (Kagurazaka, Tokyo, Japan)4. TheM. hakoostrain was cultured in 0.05% HYPONeX (HYPONeX Japan Corp., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) liquid medium and on 0.05% HYPONeX gellan gum-based solid medium in plates.Cyanidioschyzon merolae10D (Toda et al. 1995) was cultured in Misumi–Kuroiwa medium at pH 2.2 and 42 °C55. The Misumi–Kuroiwa medium was prepared by diluting 1 mL of a commercial nutrient solution (Hyponex, N: P: K 10: 8: 8; Hyponex Japan, Osaka, Japan) to 1 L with distilled or tap water. The pH in the medium was adjusted to pH 2.2 with 1 mL concentrated HCl. DiploidSaccharomyces cerevisiaeBY4743 strains were cultured at 30 °C in YPD medium that contained 1% yeast extract (Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 2% peptone (Kyokuto Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and 2% glucose56. TheB. brauniiKützing (NIES-2199) line was obtained from the Microbial Culture Collection at the National Institute for Environmental Studies (Japan) and cultured in AF-6 medium57at 22 °C. The light–dark cycle for the cell-cycle synchronization culture was as follows: 12-h light:12-h dark. In the mitotic phase,M. hakoocells were sampled every hour and examined using a microscope. Each cell type (one-cell, two-cells, and four-cells) was counted. More than five fields of view (1 × 103µm2) were selected for each sample. This experiment was performed several times and representative results are presented. TheM. hakoo,C. merolae, andS. cerevisiaecells were stained with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)5. SYBR Green I stain, which has been used to examine cell nuclei in various algae because it is unaffected by the genomic G + C content58, was used to confirm the presence of the cell nuclei and organelle nucleoids revealed by conventional DAPI staining59. Cultures were centrifuged and the resulting pellet was resuspended, after which a 3 µL aliquot of the solution was placed on a glass slide to form a droplet. Next, 3 µL 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in NS buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.8 mM PMSF, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 0.1 mM calcium chloride, 0.1mM zinc sulfate and 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) was added to the droplet, followed by the addition of 3 µL DAPI (15 µg mL−1) or 3 µL SYBR Green I (1 µg mL−1). A coverslip was placed on the droplet and then gently pressed. The stained samples were observed using an Olympus BH-2 BHS epifluorescence microscope. Electron microscopy analyses were performed as previously described4. Briefly,M. hakoowas fixed for 4 h in 1% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in a sodium cacodylate buffer. After post-fixation and dehydration steps, the samples were embedded in Spurr’s resin. Ultrathin sections of the samples were stained with 5% (w/v) uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The JEM 1200 EXS electron microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was used to examine the prepared samples. Medakamo hakoocells were frozen and then ground using a mortar and pestle. We extracted genomic DNA in two phenol extraction cycles, which were followed by an ethanol precipitation step. The DNA solution was purified by cesium chloride density-gradient centrifugation. The genomic DNA was purified using the AMPure XP kit (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). Purified samples were fragmented using g-TUBE (Covaris, IL, USA). The fragmented DNA was blunted and fused with SMRTbell adapters using the SMRTbell Template Prep Kit 1.0 (Pacific Bioscience, CA, USA). We evaluated the size distribution of the adapter-fused DNA by pulse-field electrophoresis and performed a size selection step (15.0 kb cut-off) using the BluePippin system (Sage Science, MA, USA). The sequencing library was quantified using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). The sequencing primer was annealed and DNA polymerase was bound to the sequencing library using the DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P6 (version 2) (Pacific Bioscience, CA, USA). The sequencing templates were bound to magnetic beads using MagBead OneCellPerWell (Pacific Bioscience, CA, USA) and added to a SMART cell for the subsequent sequencing on the PacBio RS II system (Pacific Bioscience, CA, USA). For thede novosequence assembly, the obtained reads were analyzed with the RS_HGAP Assemble.3 program of the SMRT analysis software (version 2.3.0). Medakamo hakoocells were ground to a powder in liquid nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. The cell powder was resuspended in 5 mL warmed (55 °C) nucleic acid extraction buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 100 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 2% Sarkosyl, and 4% SDS) and the resulting solution was stirred. The RNA extraction using a phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1, v/v/v) was repeated twice. The extract was purified by ethanol precipitation, and the total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, CA, USA). Next, 1 µL (5 units) Recombinant DNase I (RNase-free) (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) in 10 µL 10× buffer and 1 µL (40 units) Recombinant RNase Inhibitor (Takara Bio) were added to 100 µL crude RNA solution, which was then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the addition of 5 µL 0.5 M EDTA, the solution was incubated at 80 °C for 5 min. The RNA in the solution was precipitated in ethanol and then dissolved in pure water. After the quality was checked using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and the Agilent 2200 TapeStation, a sequencing library was produced using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, CA, USA). The quality of the sequencing library was evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Both cBot and the HiSeq PE Cluster Kit (version 4) (Illumina) were used for the cluster formation step. The library was sequenced (100-bp paired-end reads) using the HiSeq 2500 system and the HiSeq SBS Kit (version 4) (Illumina). Sixteen contigs were annotated after removing two organellar contigs. The completeness of the contigs was evaluated using BUSCO (version 5.2.2)19and the chlorophyta_odb10 dataset. Repeat sequences were identified and masked using RepeatModeler (version 2.0.2)60and RepeatMasker (version 4.1.1) (https://www.repeatmasker.org/). Gene models were predicted according to RNA-seq reads, which were trimmed using the default options of fastp (version 0.20.0)61. The trimmed RNA-seq reads were mapped to the contigs using the default options of HISAT2 (version 2.2.1)62, whereas the initial gene models were predicted using “stopCodonExcludedFromCDS = False” of BRAKER2 (version 2.1.5)21. Gene models were also predicted using PASA (version 2.4.1)63, GeneMark-ET (version 4.33)64, and SNAP (version 2006-07-28)65in the funannotate pipeline (version 1.8.9) (https://github.com/nextgenusfs/funannotate). These gene models were combined with those obtained from BRAKER2 (with weight = 1) using EvidenceModeler (version 1.1.1)66. The quality of gene prediction was evaluated using BUSCO19,20with the protein mode and the chlorophyta dataset. Functional annotation was conducted using eggNOG-mapper 2.1.922and GhostKOALA23. To evaluate the quality of theM. hakoogenome assembly, we performed a BUSCO analysis (Simão et al. 2015) using the chlorophyta dataset. Contig sequences excluding organelle-derived contigs and predicted protein-coding sequences were used for the BUSCO analysis. The chloroplast genomes ofM. hakooand 63 green algae reported by Lemieux et al.67were included in the phylogenomic analyses. A total of 79 protein-coding genes were used to construct the following phylogenetic datasets as previously: accD, atpA, B, E, F, H, I, ccsA, cemA, chlB, I, L, N, clpP, cysA, T, ftsH, infA, minD, petA, B, D, G, L, psaA, B, C, I, J, M, psbA, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, T, Z, rbcL, rpl2, 5, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20, 23, 32, 36, rpoA, B, C1, C2, rps2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 19, tufA, ycf1, 3, 4, 12, 20, 47, and 62. Amino acid datasets were prepared as follows. The deduced amino acid sequences of the 79 selected genes were aligned using MUSCLE 3.868. The ambiguously aligned regions in each alignment were removed using TRIMAL 1.469with the following settings: block = 6, gt = 0.7, st = 0.005, and sw = 3. The protein alignments were concatenated using Phyutility 2.2.670. Maximum-likelihood analyses were conducted using the edge-linked partition model of IQ-TREE 1.6.171,72. The datasets were partitioned by gene, with the model applied to each partition. The optimal amino acid substitution model for each gene, partitioned by the datasets, was selected according to the Bayesian information criterion using the ModelFinder function of IQ-TREE73. Branch support for the resulting ML trees was calculated via a non-parametric bootstrap analysis and the SH-like approximate likelihood-ratio test74. Bayesian analyses were performed using the site-heterogeneous CATGTR  +  Γ4 model and PhyloBayes 4.175. Five independent chains were run for 5000 cycles, and consensus topologies were calculated from the saved trees using the BPCOMP program of PhyloBayes after a burn-in of 1250 cycles. The largest discrepancy value across all bipartitions in the consensus topologies (maxdiff) under these conditions was less than 0.13, suggesting that the chains were substantially converged. The sequences of the chloroplast Rubisco large subunit gene (rbcL) of the algal strains identified asChoricystisandBotryococcusspecies were obtained as aligned sequences following a BLASTN search of the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using theM. hakoo rbcLsequence (1431 bp) (accession no. LC709230) as the query. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX76. Additionally, therbcLsequences of SAG 251-1 (NIES-1436) and SAG 251-218were determined by Sanger sequencing of the PCR products (accession nos. LC709231 and LC709232) and then added to the alignment. The ML analyses of the alignedrbcLsequences were performed using MEGAX77, with the best-fit model (GTR + G + I) selected by MEGAX and topological support assessed with 1000 bootstrap replicates78. ThreeBotryococcussequences were treated as the outgroup on the basis of the present chloroplast multigene phylogeny (Fig.2b). We culturedM. hakooin the liquid media described in Supplementary Table8. ForB. braunii, AF-6 was used as the normal medium. After a 13-day culture, cells were collected by centrifugation and then stained with 20 µg mL−1Nile Red diluted with phosphate buffer. We used the Genedata Profiler Genome software (version 10.1.14a; Genedata, Basel, Switzerland) to analyze the assembled genomic sequence and annotation data. TopHat (version 2.0.14)79,80was used for mapping. The total read count was 68,289,325 and 95.9% of the reads were mapped onto theM. hakoogenome. Genomic data (nuclear and organellar genomes) for the following species were obtained from the RefSeq database81:A. thaliana,Glycine max,Oryza sativa,Selaginella moellendorffii,Physcomitrella patens,Amborella trichopoda,C. reinhardtii,V. carterif.nagariensis,Monoraphidium neglectum,O. lucimarinusCCE9901,O. tauri,B. prasinos,Micromonas commoda,Micromonas pusillaCCMP1545,C. subellipsoideaC-169,C. variabilis,A. protothecoides,C. merolaestrain 10D,G. sulphuraria, andC. crispus. TheChloropicon primusgenome was previously analyzed by Lemieux et al.82. The genome size and gene number analyses did not include organellar genome data. A BLASTP analysis was performed by screening the KEGG database using the predicted CDSs in theM. hakoogenome as queries. The K numbers of each gene were obtained. Next, the pathway count data for each organism (C. reinhardtii,V. carterif.nagariensis,O. lucimarinusCCE9901,M. commoda,C. subellipsoideaC-169,C. variabilis, andA. protothecoides) were acquired from the KEGG database (https://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg_ja.html) and compared with the pathway information for theM. hakoogenome. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the common gene sets was performed using enrichKEGG in the clusterProfiler package83. TheKnumbers of the C15 and PS gene sets were used for this analysis. The C15 gene set served as the background to assess the KEGG pathway enrichment of the AS gene set. Additionally, “ko” was selected as the parameter for “organisms”. Details of the statistics for the enrichment analysis are described in the Statistics and Reproducibility section. Protein samples were dissolved in the sample buffer and partially separated (approximately 1 cm) using a NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA). Electrophoresis was performed according to instructions of the manufacturer. Each lane was excised from the unstained gel. In-gel digestion was performed using 0.01 µg/µL LysC and trypsin84. The resulting peptides were analyzed using the Q Exactive hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA)85. The MS/MS spectra were interpreted and then peak lists were generated using Proteome Discoverer 2.2.0.388 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA). The SEQUEST program was used to search the in-houseM. hakooprotein database with the following settings: enzyme selected with up to two missing cleavage sites; peptide mass tolerance, 10 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, 0.02 Da; fixed modification, carbamidomethylation (C); and variable modification, oxidation (M). Peptides were identified according to significant Xcorr values (high confidence filter). The peptide identification and modification information obtained from SEQUEST was manually examined and filtered to obtain confirmed peptide identification and modification lists for the HCD MS/MS analysis. The precursor ion intensity (normalized against the total peptide amount) was used for the label-free quantification. The detected peptides encoded by specific regions in theM. hakoogenome were used for the codon count. All complete CDSs mapped on the basis of these peptides were used. We counted the codons in the genome sequence encoding the peptides using the R package coRdon (https://github.com/BioinfoHR/coRdon). The completeM. hakoodraft genome sequence and theEscherichia coli,C. reinhardtii,C. merolae, andS. coelicolorgenome sequences were analyzed using the default settings of the pqsfinder software to identify potential G4-forming sequences27. TheC. merolae6,7,O. tauri9,10,S. cerevisiaestrain S288C86, andM. hakooamino acid sequence datasets were analyzed. For the orthologous group analyses, gene families were identified using OrthoFinder40. Protein sequences were compared in all-vs-all BLASTP searches using the NCBI blast+ toolkit87, as suggested in the OrthoFinder manual. Orthogroup composition data (Supplementary Data4) for microalgae were analyzed with the prcomp package (version 4.0.2) in R.

While analyzing DNA samples taken from the algae, researchers from the University of Tokyo discoveredMedakamo hakoo, whose DNA sequence didn’t match any on record. This new species is the smallest known freshwater green algae, with inherent qualities which enable it to be cultured stably at high density, meaning it could be effectively used to produce useful products for food and industry.
If you’ve picked up seaweed on the beach, waded through fronds in a stream or cleaned out a grimy, green fish tank, then you’ll know what algae is. These diverse aquatic organisms thrive on water, light and nutrients and come in all sorts of shapes, colors and sizes. Microalgae are an ultrasmall type of algae which are invisible to the human eye, but a vital part of the Earth’s ecosystem, forming the basis for all aquatic food chains. They have attracted particular attention from researchers and businesses for their ability to capture carbon dioxide, their use as a biofuel, as an alternative source of protein, and more. There are tens of thousands of types of microalgae, which continue to thrive in unexpected places.
“We were very surprised to discover a new species of microalgae in just a regular home aquarium,” said Professor Sachihiro Matsunaga from the Graduate School of Frontier Sciences. “Alga were taken from the water and cultured one by one. The DNA of the alga was fluorescently stained and microscopically observed to find the one with the least amount of DNA per cell. We then sequenced the DNA of that alga and compared it to the DNA of other algae. The results did not match the DNA of any previously reported algae, indicating that it was a new species, and we named itMedakamo hakoo (M. hakoo).”
Microalgae are made up of relatively few genes, and this uncomplicated form makes them useful for researchers trying to identify what roles different genes play and how they could be used. Of the tens of thousands of known microalgae, many remain uncharacterized. Thanks to this latest study, we now know that not only is this a new species, but it also has the smallest known genome of any freshwater algae, as well as other useful qualities.
“M. hakoocontains only one mitochondrion (for producing energy) and one chloroplast (which contains chlorophyll and creates food through photosynthesis), whereas normal plant cells contain multiple mitochondria and chloroplasts. This indicates that it is a green alga with an extremely simple cell structure,” explained Matsunaga. “From our research, we have also speculated that it has an unprecedented DNA structure and a new gene regulatory system. Its cell cycle is also strongly synchronized with the day and night cycle, which is key to effective, stable bioproduction. Due to these inherent qualities and extremely small size,M. hakoocan be effectively cultured at high cell density, making it possible to mass produce substances such as highly functional foods, cosmetics and bio-fuel at a low cost.”
The researchers plan to continue to explore the potential applications forM. hakoo, both in the lab and the wider world. “Aquatic green algae are the originating organisms of today’s land plants. Thanks to this research, we can better understand the minimum number of genes required for an organism to evolve and thrive in diverse environments, which we will continue to study,” said Matsunaga. “In the future, I would like to find ways to collaborate and create useful substances from the mass cultivation ofM. hakoo.”

Thus, tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) is considered to be proportional to spin polarization at the interface1and, to date, has been studied primarily in ferromagnets. Here we report observation of TMR in an all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junction consisting of Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn (ref.6). We measured a TMR ratio of around 2% at room temperature, which arises between the parallel and antiparallel configurations of the cluster magnetic octupoles in the chiral antiferromagnetic state. Moreover, we carried out measurements using a Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn MTJ and show that the sign and direction of anisotropic longitudinal spin-polarized current in the antiferromagnet7can be controlled by octupole direction. Strikingly, the TMR ratio (about 2%) of the all-antiferromagnetic MTJ is much larger than that estimated using the observed spin polarization. Theoretically, we found that the chiral antiferromagnetic MTJ may produce a substantially large TMR ratio as a result of the time-reversal, symmetry-breaking polarization characteristic of cluster magnetic octupoles. Our work lays the foundation for the development of ultrafast and efficient spintronic devices using antiferromagnets8,9,10. The discovery of giant magnetoresistance11and tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR)1,2,3,4,5has facilitated rapid progress in the highly integrated and efficient spintronic technologies based on ferromagnets. TMR and spin-transfer torque (STT), due to longitudinal spin-polarized current, provide the reading and writing protocols for the two-terminal magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) recently commercialized12,13,14. In addition to the well-established ferromagnetic spintronics, antiferromagnets have attracted tremendous interest6,7,8,9,10,15as next-generation active elements for further improvement in operation speed and integration density. Whereas no STT method has been demonstrated experimentally, various writing means have been developed16,17,18,19, including spin-orbit torque20,21,22, using the same methods used for ferromagnets. In regard to readout, the anomalous Hall effect6,23,24,25,26has recently become available for antiferromagnets in addition to anisotropic magnetoresistance8,9,10,18,27and spin Hall magnetoresistance19. In addition, tunnelling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) has been investigated for junctions based on a single antiferromagnetic electrode28,29,30. However, TAMR is generally seen at low temperatures and those much lower than the TMR, even when it becomes available at room temperature. Regarding the perspective of future applications, it is highly important to develop TMR using all-antiferromagnetic MTJs, which potentially generates a high magnetoresistance ratio. On the other hand, research and development of the TMR effect has been restricted primarily to ferromagnetic MTJs because the effect is considered to derive from finite spin polarization at the interface between the magnetic electrodes and insulating barrier1,2,3,4,5. Thus, no reports have been published to date on the TMR effect using an all-antiferromagnetic MTJ. In addition, as the basis for designing the STT–MRAM based solely on antiferromagnets, observation and manipulation of longitudinal spin-polarized current is necessary but, again, has never been performed for antiferromagnets. Here we report our discovery of a finite TMR of approximately 2% using a MTJ solely comprising an antiferromagnet. Moreover, our experiment has further clarified the existence of the anisotropic, longitudinal spin-polarized current in an antiferromagnet. Strikingly, the size of TMR in the all-antiferromagnetic MTJ is much larger than the conventional estimate based on spin polarization and thus should derive from a new mechanism. Ferromagnetic TMR produces the binary signals '0' and '1', respectively, via parallel and antiparallel arrangements of spin polarization in a pair of ferromagnetic electrodes (Fig.1a). In principle, analogous binary states can be defined for an antiferromagnetic MTJ providing that the antiferromagnetic states break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) macroscopically. Such antiferromagnets have recently been discovered and intensively studied for the development of antiferromagnetic spintronics, because they produce large transverse effects despite vanishingly small magnetization6,23,24,25,26,31,32. Breaking of TRS in these antiferromagnetic states leads to characteristic electronic structures such as magnetic Weyl semimetal state33,34, spin-splitting bands7,31,32,35,36and polarization of cluster magnetic multipoles37. a, Schematics of ferromagnetic (FM) tunnel junction sandwiching an insulating barrier (middle layer, darker colour); the parallel 0 and antiparallel 1 configurations of ferromagnetic moments (purple arrows) generate two different resistance states.b, Schematics of a tunnel junction made solely of antiferromagnetic (AFM) electrodes with a magnetic order parameter-breaking TRS, such as the cluster magnetic octupole in Mn3Sn. The antiferromagnet Mn3Sn has a hexagonal Ni3Sn-type structure (space group P63/mmc)6, and Mn moments (red and blue arrows) form a cluster magnetic octupole (orange arrows) consisting of six spins on the kagome bilayer. States 0 and 1 arise when the top and bottom octupole polarizations are parallel and antiparallel, respectively.c, Projected density of states (pDOS) onto 3dorbitals computed using DFT for two opposite spin states withσ+andσ−in Mn3Sn. The pDOS is symmetric in terms of spin polarization (red and blue arrows). Here the direction of spin polarization is parallel to theaaxis of the crystal.d, Calculated pDOS with projection onto octupolar ordered states with opposite octupole momentsτ+ andτ−. Here the polarization direction of the cluster magnetic octupole is parallel to theaaxis of the crystal and lies in the kagome plane. Inset, corresponding octupole-majority and -minority states used for calculations. Black and red lines correspond to octupole-majority (pDOSmaj) and octupole-minority (pDOSmin) DOSs, respectively. The absolute value of pDOSmajis higher when energy levelEis lower than Fermi energyEF, whereas that of pDOSmindominates at higherE. The polarity of octupole polarization changes sign by tuning the Fermi energy of Mn3Sn (Extended Data Fig.2c). Source data Here we focus on a specific example, the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. This hexagonal kagome metal has attracted much interest because it exhibits large transverse responses normally absent in antiferromagnets6,38,39,40. Below the Néel temperatureTN≈ 430 K, all Mn moments of approximately 3 μBlying in the kagome plane form an antichiral 120° spin order. The magnetic texture can be viewed as a ferroic order of cluster magnetic octupole lying in the kagome plane (Fig.1bandMethods)37,39. This ferroic octupole order breaks the TRS macroscopically and allows us to define states 0 and 1 as the parallel and antiparallel configurations, respectively, of octupole polarization (Fig.1b, orange arrows andMethods). In addition, it is ferroic octupole order that stabilizes the magnetic Weyl semimetal state33,34and drives large transverse responses such as the anomalous Hall effect6, anomalous Nernst effect38and magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE)39. To further demonstrate the analogy between spin polarization in ferromagnets, and octupole polarization in antiferromagnets, we drew the projected density of states (DOS) for the positive and negative polarization of spins (Fig.1c) and magnetic octupoles (Fig.1d) in the chiral antiferromagnetic state of Mn3Sn. In sharp contrast with the symmetric DOS projected onto spin-up and -down states (Fig.1c), we found a clear energy shift between the majority and minority bands of the octupole moment (Fig.1dandMethods), closely resembling the shift in the majority and minority bands of the spin moment in ferromagnetic iron (Extended Data Fig.2a). For conventional ferromagnetic TMR, the imbalance in spin polarization is the key origin according to the basic model for TMR proposed by Julliere1(Fig.1a, Extended Data Fig.2a,bandMethods). This suggests that similar TRS breaking due to the imbalance seen in octupole polarization might lead to antiferromagnetic TMR (Fig.1b,d). To examine whether a finite TMR effect can be generated between the parallel and antiparallel arrangements of the cluster magnetic octupole moments in Mn3Sn, we carried out a theoretical simulation from first principles (Methodsand Extended Data Fig.3). We used specific geometry for calculations—namely, the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn (0001) structure, in which octupole moments are inside the plane perpendicular to the conducting path. We calculated tunnelling conductances for the parallel and antiparallel arrangements of the octupole moments at the Fermi level, which give the finite positive TMR ratio (Extended Data Fig.3dandMethods). Although the net magnetic moments of Mn3Sn were vanishingly small, the calculated TMR ratio was as large as that obtained in a ferromagnetic counterpart, Fe/vacuum/Fe MTJ (Extended Data Fig.3i). This indicates that Mn3Sn has great potential for use in TMR-based devices such as MRAM, because of the macroscopic TRS breaking captured by cluster octupole moments (Methods). In addition, we found that the transmission properties are robust against both interfacial disorder and the relative lateral shift of the atomic layer at the interface, being useful for TMR applications (Methods, Extended Data Fig.5and Supplementary Figs.4and5). Motivated by this possibility, we fabricated the Mn3Sn-based MTJ to demonstrate the TMR effect corresponding to binary states 0 and 1. To observe reliable tunnelling conduction, preparation of a continuous and smooth tunnelling barrier is essential. As shown in Fig.2a, we fabricated the stack consisting of W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) from the MgO substrate side (Methods). According to theory, tunnelling conductance can be potentially anisotropic (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig.1). On the other hand, characterization of films by Hall and Kerr effects may be possible only when octupole polarization has the out-of-plane component. Given these two constraints, we fabricated an epitaxial film of Mn3Sn with the\((01\bar{1}1)\)orientation aligned close to the out-of-plane direction by taking advantage of the fact that the MgO barrier tends to grow along the [001] direction (Extended Data Fig.10andMethods). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging confirmed the presence of stack films with a sharp and continuous interface between Mn3Sn and MgO (Fig.2a, Extended Data Fig.9andMethods). In addition, thecaxis of Mn3Sn was found to be approximately 30° off the normal direction of the film (Extended Data Fig.10andMethods), allowing us to characterize the films and to measure tunnelling conduction in the Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn trilayer, as discussed below. a, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy image of the heterostructure consisting of the antiferromagnetic tunnel junction, W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm), on the MgO substrate.

Four different octupole configurations were obtained, namely from the positive high-field side and up–up, down–up (blue region), up–down (red region) and down–down configurations. Here we show only octupole configurations, for visual clarity. Inset, tunnelling resistanceRas a function of MgO thicknessd.d,e, Schematics for measurement configurations are also shown in insets (Methods). The TMR sign is negative (Methods). In addition, our measurements of the inelastic electron tunnelling spectrum suggest that magnon-electron scattering in the energy range up to 0.1 eV may play a key role in TMR (Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig.3). Source data For observation of the TMR effect, the top and bottom Mn3Sn electrodes are required to have two distinctive coercivities so that the parallel and antiparallel configurations of octupole polarizations arise as a function of magnetic field (Fig.1b). We characterized the coercivities of the two Mn3Sn layers in the MTJ by field-sweep measurements of polar MOKE at room temperature, where a polarized light beam was injected into both top and bottom layers (Fig.2bandMethods). Figure2cpresents polar MOKE loops measured in magnetic fieldBapplied perpendicular to the plane. The top and bottom Mn3Sn layers produced clear hysteresis, with square loops as a function of fieldB,and yielded sizeable changes in Kerr rotation angles∣θK∣(Fig.2c). It should be noted that the coercive field ofBc, at approximately 0.5 T for the top Mn3Sn (Fig.2c, red), is twofold that ofBcat 0.25 T for the bottom layer (Fig.2c, blue). Therefore, these two coercivities should generate state 1 when top and bottom octupole moments are antiparallel. We further examined the formation of binary states via Hall measurements in a magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane. To stabilize state 0, in which octupole moments in both the top and bottom Mn3Sn point upward, we first applied the magnetic field of +2 T, which is larger than all coercive fields. By sweeping the field from +2 to −2 T (Fig.2d) we found two transitions atBc(approximately −0.2 and approximately −0.6 T) close to the coercivities seen in the MOKE measurements above, supporting the premise that coercive fields are nearly identical in the bulk and interface detected by the Hall effect and MOKE measurements, respectively. When the field passed through the smaller coercivity atBc(approximately –0.2 T), the octupole moment in the bottom Mn3Sn layer reversed, producing state 1 with antiparallel configuration (red regions in Fig.2d,e). When the field passed through the larger coercivity ofBc(approximately −0.6 T), the octupole moment in the top layer also began rotating downwards, establishing state 0 in which octupole moments were again parallel. When the field was scanned back from −2 to +2 T, these two transitions also occurred atBc(approximately 0.2 and approximately 0.6 T), stabilizing a further state 1 between 0.2 and 0.6 T (blue regions in Fig.2d,e), as well as a state 0 greater than 0.6 T. We then moved our focus to the field dependence of the TMR in the antiferromagnetic MTJ. By scanning the field applied perpendicularly to the film plane from +1.5 to −1.5 T, we found that resistance exhibited a clear drop whenBwas between −0.2 and −0.6 T. This low-resistance state (LRS) appeared again between 0.2 and 0.6 T when we swept the field backwards from −1.5 to +1.5 T. The LRS and the remaining high-resistance state (HRS) correspond to states 1 and 0 in the MOKE and Hall measurements (Fig.2c,d)—that is, the antiparallel and parallel configurations of the top and bottom octupole moments, respectively. By adapting the definition TMR = (HRS – LRS)/LRS × 100%, we estimated the TMR ratio to be around 0.6% at room temperature in this device. The inset in Fig.2eshows tunnelling resistance as a function of MgO thickness; the exponential increase in resistance confirmed the reliability of tunnelling conduction. Our first observation of TMR in the all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junction Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn is outstanding. On the other hand, the magnitude is still small, raising the question of whether this arose from the TRS-breaking octupole polarization—as our theory suggests—or from spin polarization, which is widely accepted to generate the conventional TMR effects1,2,3,4,5. Previous theoretical work indicates that Mn3Sn may host the longitudinal spin-polarized current7because the non-collinear antiferromagnetic state breaks the TRS macroscopically6,7. In the following, we examine the latter scenario by investigating spin-polarized current in Mn3Sn through the conventional TMR scheme1. Theoretically, spin-polarized current is described by a spin-conductivity tensor\({\sigma }_{ij}^{k}\), in which electric fieldEalong axisjdrives the spin current flowing along directioniwith spin polarization aligned along thekaxis7. The non-collinear antichiral ordering produces momentum-dependent spin polarization on the Fermi surface, and thus the application of an electric field may drive net longitudinal spin-polarized current with the spin-polarization direction along the octupole polarization (Supplementary Fig.2). To evaluate the magnitude and sign of the longitudinal spin-polarized current generated in Mn3Sn, we fabricated a Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn MTJ with an in-plane magnetized Fe layer using, respectively, the antiferromagnet Mn3Sn and the typical ferromagnet Fe as the source and detector of the spin-polarized current. We can use the magnetic field to orient spin polarization by directing octupole polarization along the magnetic field. First, for detection of\({\sigma }_{ii}^{j}\)we applied the in-plane field so that the directions of electric fieldEand magnetic fieldB(iandj, respectively) were perpendicular (Fig.3a). By sweeping the magnetic field along the in-plane directionjfrom +1.5 to −1.5 T and back to +1.5 T, a negative TMR ratio of 0.2% was observed (Fig.3c). Assuming the spin polarization of Fe/MgO to be around 0.6, analysis based on the Julliere model yields a spin polarization of Mn3Sn of about −2 × 10−3(Methods)1. Here, the spin-polarization direction (solid blue arrow in Fig.3a) is perpendicular to the electric field (solid blue arrow) and the negative sign of spin polarization is consistent with the theoretical analysis of\({\sigma }_{ii}^{j}\)(ref.7). a,b, Schematics of the MTJ consisting of Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn. The spin current detector Fe has the in-plane easy axis (a) and out-of-plane easy axis (b) (Methods). The corresponding magnetizations in Fe (purple arrows), net polarization direction of octupole polarization (orange arrows) and spin polarization (small blue arrows) of longitudinal spin current induced along the electric fieldE(dashed blue arrows) in Mn3Sn are schematically shown. The schematics also show switching of magnetization in Fe with a small coercivity of approximately a few mT.c, Field dependence of TMR measured in magnetic fieldBapplied within the Mn3Sn film plane, and electric currentIapplied perpendicular to the Mn3Sn plane using the MTJ shown ina.d, Field dependence of TMR measured in magnetic fieldBand electric currentIapplied perpendicular to the Mn3Sn film plane using the MTJ shown inb.

Insets show tunnelling resistanceRas a function of MgO thicknessd.e, Magnetic field dependence of TMR measured using the MTJ shown ina. The maximum field is 30 mT so that only the Fe moment switches. Results shown in upper and lower panels were obtained after saturating the octupole polarization in Mn3Sn with a magnetic field of  +1.5 and −1.5 T, respectively.f, Temperature dependence of TMR ratio measured using the MTJ shown ina. The TMR exists only when Mn3Sn is in the non-collinear antichiral phase (pink region). This behaviour characteristic of Mn3Sn indicates that the Mn3Sn interfacing MgO and leading to the TMR has properties similar to bulk Mn3Sn (Methods). Source data Second, we measured the TMR in another series of Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn MTJs with a perpendicular magnetized Fe layer as a function of magnetic fieldBalong the out-of-plane direction parallel to electric fieldE, for detection of\({\sigma }_{ii}^{i}\)(Methodsand Fig.3b). In contrast with the in-plane geometry above, a positive ratio of 0.5% (Fig.3d) was observed in the out-of-plane magnetized Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn. Our analysis found the spin polarization of Mn3Sn to be approximately +4 × 10−3, consistent with the predicted positive sign of\({\sigma }_{ii}^{i}\)for the case in which the spin polarization direction (small blue arrow in Fig.3b) is parallel to the electric field (blue dashed arrow). The bias dependence of TMR (Extended Data Fig.6), which may give useful information about the energy dependence of polarization41, clarified the symmetric bias dependence of the TMR ratio for the perpendicular (E⊥B) and parallel (E//B) configurations (Extended Data Fig.7), confirming the anisotropy of the longitudinal spin-polarized current in Mn3Sn. To further confirm the TRS-breaking character of the longitudinal spin-polarized current, we examined the TMR in the configuration shown in Fig.3aafter polarizion of the octupoles in Mn3Sn with an in-plane magnetic field,Bof +1.5 T and −1.5 T. For each polarized state we measured the TMR by sweeping the in-plane magnetic field within 30 mT in which only Fe moments were switched. The two different polarities of TMR were clearly observed, corresponding to polarization in +1.5 T (Fig.3e, top) and −1.5 T (Fig.3e, bottom), in accordance with the TRS-breaking character of the spin current causing the hysteresis shown in Fig.3c. Moreover, the TMR in Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn exhibited temperature dependence characteristic of Mn3Sn (Fig.3f); it is only in the antichiral non-collinear phase in which the octupoles form a ferroic order that can generate the spin-polarized current7. Thus, the observed temperature dependence confirms that the TMR effect in Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn is driven by the spin-polarized current generated in Mn3Sn. Finally, the spin polarization experimentally obtained for Mn3Sn allowed us to estimate the TMR ratio of Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn based on the Julliere model1(Methods). Namely, if we assume that the TMR is based on tunnelling between spin-polarized states as in conventional ferromagnets, the ratio should be about 0.002%, which is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the value of around 0.6% shown in Fig.2e. In addition, with increased barrier thickness and tunnelling resistance area we found that the ratio was increased up to 1.6% (Extended Data Fig.8andMethods). This indicates that the TMR observed in Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn originated not from the spin-polarized current or weak ferromagnetic moments due to canting, but from TRS breaking in the antiferromagnet—that is, the momentum-dependent, spin-splitting bands7,32,35,36caused by the polarization of magnetic octupoles37. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junction Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn shows the TMR effect at a ratio of about 2% at room temperature between the parallel and antiparallel alignments of octupole moments. The TMR ratio is far larger than its estimate based on the anisotropic spin polarization found for Mn3Sn. Besides, our theory predicts that the antiferromagnetic TMR effect originating from the TRS-breaking magnetic octupole may become as large as conventional TMR commonly seen in ferromagnets. Thus, our first observations of the all-antiferromagnetic TMR effect, as well as the anisotropic spin-polarized current, provide new and useful functionality, opening new directions in the research and development of antiferromagnetic spintronics and magnetic memory technology. A W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) (left: substrate side, right: surface side) multilayer was grown on a MgO(001) substrate. The W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm) layer was fabricated by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at a base pressure of 2 × 10−8Pa. The MgO(001) substrate was annealed at 800 °C for 10 min in the MBE chamber before deposition. The W layer (9 nm) was deposited at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1at 300 °C and subsequent annealment at 800 °C for 10 min. The Mn3Sn layer (12 nm) was fabricated at a rate of 0.25 Å s−1with coevaporation of Mn and Sn, in which the deposition rate of Mn and Sn was set for the stoichiometric composition Mn3Sn. The Mn3Sn layer (3 nm) was first deposited at room temperature and then annealed at 320 °C. The extra Mn3Sn layer (9 nm) was deposited at approximately 260 °C. Subsequently the MgO layer (3.3 nm) was fabricated at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1at room temperature. The stack was later annealed at 600 °C for 30 min. As shown in Extended Data Fig.1a, streak patterns were observed by reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), confirming the formation of epitaxial growth of flat interfaces in the W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm) layer. The incident electron beam is parallel to the MgO [100] direction. The stack was transferred to a magnetron sputtering chamber with base pressure greater than 5 × 10−7Pa. In the sputtering chamber, the Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) layer was grown at room temperature by magnetron sputtering at a rate of 0.1 nm s−1and a power of 60 W and Ar gas pressure of 0.5 Pa. After deposition, the entire stack was annealed at 450 °C to crystallize the Mn3Sn layer (42 nm), similar to our previous work for polycrystalline Mn3Sn42. To investigate crystallinity and orientation, cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for the W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) multilayer were taken at room temperature using a commercial TEM system (JEOL, JEM-ARM200F). The maximum operating voltage was 200 kV. Samples for TEM observation were prepared from the TMR device, consisting of the multilayer. using a focused ion beam (Hitachi High-Tech NX2000, Ga 2–30 kV, Ar 1 kV). Before processing, a protective film (C (100 nm)/W (100 nm)) was deposited on an area of 10 × 3 μm2on the sample surface and the sample subsequently thinned by focused Ga and Ar ion beams. The TEM images presented in Fig.2aand Extended Data Fig.10ashow the sharp interface between the Mn3Sn layers and the MgO layer. Nanobeam electron diffraction patterns of the Mn3Sn (top), MgO, Mn3Sn (bottom) and W layers show epitaxial growth from the W layer to the MgO barrier (Extended Data Fig.10b–e). As shown in Extended Data Fig.10a, we fabricated the epitaxial Mn3Sn layer on the MgO substrate(001)[010]∣∣W\((001)[\bar{1}10]\)stacks that have the\((01\bar{1}1)\)orientation aligned close to the direction of thickness. In this orientation the kagome plane, which is the magnetic easy plane for the cluster magnetic octupole, is oriented along nearly 60° off the normal direction of the film—that is, thecaxis of Mn3Sn is about 30° off the normal direction of the film, as shown by the transparent green plane in Extended Data Fig.10f. Here the size of the\((01\bar{1}1)\)-oriented Mn3Sn crystallite was confirmed to be approximately 100 nm. The MgO barrier on the epitaxial Mn3Sn (bottom) layer has around 10 nm crystallites and shows the (001) orientation with a mosaicness of about 10°. An atomic arrangement of each layer shows a potential epitaxial relationship (Extended Data Fig.10g) in which the lattice constants of MgO, W and Mn3Sn are considered to bea= 4.21 Å for MgO,a= 3.17 Å for W43anda= 5.66 Å andc= 4.53 Å for Mn3Sn6. Whereas the Mn arrangement is not perfectly square and may thus have 90°-rotated variants in the film plane, the out-of-plane orientation for all variants should be similar to that observed in the present study (Extended Data Fig.10a). A MgO (5 nm)/Fe (30 nm)/MgO (about 3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) multilayer was deposited on the MgO(001) substrate. The MgO (5 nm)/Fe (30 nm)/MgO (about 3 nm) was fabricated using the MBE method under UHV, as described above for the Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn deposition process. The MgO(001) substrate was annealed at 800 °C for 10 min in the MBE chamber before deposition. First, a MgO layer (5 nm) was grown on the substrate at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1at room temperature. Next, the Fe layer (30 nm) was deposited at a rate of 0.25 Å s−1at room temperature and subsequently annealed at 350 °C for 15 min. Finally, the MgO layer (about 3 nm) was fabricated at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1at room temperature. As shown in Extended Data Fig.1b, clear streak patterns were observed by RHEED, confirming the formation of epitaxial layers with flat interfaces in the MgO (5 nm)/Fe (30 nm)/MgO (about 3 nm) layer. The incident electron beam was parallel to the MgO [100] direction. The stack was transferred to the magnetron sputtering chamber and the Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) layer additionally grown at room temperature by magnetron sputtering at a rate of 0.1 nm s−1with a power of 60 W and Ar gas pressure 0.5 Pa. After deposition, the entire stack was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. A MgO (5 nm)/V (30 nm)/Fe (0.6 nm)/MgO (about 3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) multilayer was deposited on the MgO(001) substrate. The MgO (5 nm)/V (30 nm)/Fe (0.6 nm)/MgO (about 3 nm) was fabricated by the MBE method in the UHV MBE chamber. Similar to the method used for the Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn stack, we first deposited a MgO layer (5 nm) on the substrate at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1at room temperature. The V layer (30 nm) was deposited at a rate of 0.25 Å s−1at room temperature and subsequently annealed at 500 °C for 20 min. The Fe (0.6 nm) and MgO (about 3 nm) layers were deposited at room temperature at rates of 0.05 and 0.1 Å s−1, respectively. As shown in Extended Data Fig.1c, clear streak patterns were observed by RHEED, confirming the formation of epitaxial layers with flat interfaces in the MgO (5 nm)/V (30 nm)/Fe (0.6 nm)/MgO (about 3 nm) layer. The incident electron beam was parallel to the MgO [100] direction. The stack was transferred to the magnetron sputtering chamber and the Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) layer additionally grown by magnetron sputtering at room temperature at a rate of 0.1 nm s−1with a power of 60 W and Ar gas pressure 0.5 Pa. After deposition, the entire stack was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. In this stack the V layer was used as the seed layer, which can help to induce the strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy of ultrathin Fe (under 1 nm)44,45. We carried out all fabrication processes in situ, including sample transfer from the MBE chamber to the sputtering chamber. The sputtering-grown Mn3Sn layer (42 nm) on the MgO layer was used for all samples. The composition of this Mn3Sn layer was determined to be Mn3.15Sn0.85by scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Although this composition is Mn rich, it is also a stable composition for a single phase of the D019Mn3Sn42, in which excess Mn randomly occupies the Sn site6,46. We encapsulated MTJ devices in SiOx, with electrical contacts formed from 60 nm Pt. Hall measurements were conducted at 300 K in a commercial physical property measurement system (Quantum Design). The field dependence of Hall resistivity was obtained after subtracting the longitudinal resistivity contribution, which was found to be constant as a function of magnetic field. Zero-field Hall resistivity,ρH(B= 0) was estimated as (ρH(B= +0) −ρH(B= −0)/2. Here +0 and −0 were used to indicate zero magnetic field approached from +2 and −2 T, respectively. Tunnelling resistance was measured with a two-probe method in a probe system with an electromagnet at room temperature. A commercial source measurement unit (Keithley 2400, Tektronix) was used to measure resistance for the microfabricated magnetic tunnel junctions. Because a fixed resistor of 1 kΩ was series connected with the MTJ to protect it during measurements, MTJ data include 1 kΩ from the fixed resistor. Electrical measurements recorded below room temperature were performed under 10−4Pa in a vacuum chamber cooled by a helium compressor. The sample substrate was fixed on a Cu sample stage and temperature measured by a thermometer inside the sample stage. The magnetic field dependence of MOKE was measured using a commercial system (NanoMOKE3, Quantum Design). The top and bottom Mn3Sn layers in the W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) stacks were used for measurement in a polar MOKE configuration under out-of-plane applied magnetic fields between –1.3 and +1.3 T at room temperature. MOKE loops were acquired using a 660 nm semiconductor laser and a spatial light modulator enabling acquisition of 20 hysteresis loops at a rate of 0.1 Hz. To obtain the MOKE signal, we subtracted theB-linear part originating from the extrinsic contribution (for example, a Faraday effect of the optical lenses). Our MOKE measurements for the W (9 nm)/Mn3Sn (12 nm)/MgO (3.3 nm)/Mn3Sn (42 nm)/Ta (5 nm) stacks showed that the coercive field ofBc(approximately 0.5 T) for the top Mn3Sn (Fig.2c, red) was twice that ofBc(about 0.25 T) for the bottom layer (Fig.2c, blue), probably due to the difference in buffer layers facing each Mn3Sn (W for bottom and MgO for top), as well as to variation in the thickness of Mn3Sn. The projected density of states (pDOS) of Mn3Sn and body-centred cubic Fe (bcc-Fe) was calculated with the Wannier functions obtained using the WANNIER90 package47,48,49, in which localized Wannier functions are constructed by projection of Bloch wave functions onto atomic orbitals. Bloch wave functions were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the QUANTUM ESPRESSO (QE) packages50,51. In DFT calculations, the projector-augmented wave pseudopotential with spin-orbit couplings52was used, with exchange correlation taken into account by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof-type generalized gradient approximation53. For Mn3Sn, the lattice constantsa= 5.665 Å andc= 4.531 Å were used54andk-point meshes were 7 × 7 × 7 and 8 × 8 × 8 for self-consistent field (scf) and non-scf calculations, respectively. The cut-off energies of wave function and charge density were 80 and 320 Ry, respectively. Bloch wave functions were projected onto thes-,p- andd-orbitals of Mn ions and thes- andp-orbitals of Sn ions. For bcc-Fe we used the lattice constanta= 2.87 Å, and 8 × 8 × 8 and 12 × 12 × 12k-point grids were used for scf and non-scf calculations, respectively. We set the energy cut-offs of wave function and charge density as 80 and 500 Ry, respectively. Bloch states were projected onto thes-,p- andd-orbitals of the Fe ion. In Wannierization we set thek-point mesh as 8 × 8 × 8 and 12 × 12 × 12 for Mn3Sn and bcc-Fe, respectively. Using Wannier functions we calculated pDOS with the 64 × 64 × 64k-point grid onto cluster magnetic octupolar ordered states of Mn3Sn and the magnetic ordered states of bcc-Fe. For the symmetry operation of the structural D6hpoint group, the non-collinear magnetic order of Mn3Sn has the same transformation properties as the cluster magnetic octupole moment, with\({T}_{\gamma }^{x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-{M}_{31}+{M}_{3-1})\)and\({T}_{\gamma }^{y}=\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}({M}_{31}+{M}_{3-1})\,\)37,55. This octupole moment has the same irreducible representation as the ferromagnetic dipole,\({J}_{x}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-{M}_{11}+{M}_{1-1})\)and\({J}_{y}=\frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}({M}_{11}+{M}_{1-1})\), and thus its ferroic order breaks time-reversal symmetry macroscopically. This also indicates that the cluster magnetic octupole is parallel to the weak ferromagnetic moment (approximately 7 mμB/Mn) due to spin canting, which arises as a result of the competition between Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction, exchange coupling and single-ion anisotropy56. Therefore, the driving mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect of Mn3Sn can be interpreted as the ferroic order of the octupole moment of Mn3Sn, in the same way as the ferromagnetic order of the dipole moment of Fe. The cluster multipole theory is thus useful for understanding the underlying physics on non-collinear antiferromagnets such as Mn3Sn37. In the calculation of octupole polarization, we estimated the expectation value of the following operator withp= 3 andq= ±1 for the Bloch wave functions obtained by generalized gradient approximation calculation: in which\({N}_{{\rm{atom}}}^{(\mu )}\)is the number of atoms of theμth cluster,σiis the Pauli matrices defined for the spin degrees of freedom of theith atom,\({\nabla }_{i}\equiv \frac{\partial }{\partial {{\bf{R}}}_{i}}\),Ri≡ (Xi,Yi,Zi) is the position of theith atom,Ypqare the spherical harmonics andRi,θiandϕiare the distance, polar angle and azimuthal angle, respectively, of theith atom. Based on the Julliere model1, the relative conduction change, ΔGbetween states 0 and 1 is described as ΔG=G× 2P1P2/(1 +P1P2), whereG,P1andP2correspond, respectively to the tunnelling conduction and spin-polarization ratio of the effective tunnelling density of states of magnetic electrodes 1 and 2. The spin polarization of Fe/MgO in our device is assumed to be about 0.6 (ref.45). Given the strong Fermi energy dependence on the sign of octupole polarization (Extended Data Fig.2c), the sign of TMR should be very sensitive to the Fermi energy of Mn3Sn. Therefore, interfacial engineering may influence the Fermi energy of Mn3Sn. Extended Data Fig.4ashows the Hall resistivity of Mn3Sn as a function of temperature. When decreasing the temperature, Hall resistivity vanishes due to the phase transition from non-collinear antichiral to spin-spiral. Both the anomalous Hall effect and non-zero spin polarization exist only in the non-collinear antichiral phase of Mn3Sn rather than in the spin-spiral phase. Nevertheless, phase transition temperature detected through TMR (black circle) was around 100 K lower than that (blue square) found in Hall resistivity (Extended Data Fig.4a). This is most probably because the Fermi energy of the interfacial Mn3Sn shifted as compared with that of the Mn3Sn film, due to its contact with MgO. In addition, the distinct Fermi level shift of Mn3Sn at the bottom and top may have arisen due to variation in the thermal annealing process (Methods). Here we roughly simulated normalized TMR via octupole polarizations from bottomτbottomand top Mn3Snτtop, normalized TMR =τbottom×τtop, assuming that the difference in Fermi energy shift is 1 eV (Extended Data Fig.4b). To theoretically simulate the TMR effect from first principles, we use the PWCOND package in the QE package57,58,59in which ballistic transport along thezdirection is calculated by solving the scattering problem on the Bloch wave function obtained by DFT calculation60. Generally for TMR, it is important to have in-depth understanding of the barrier material61,62,63. On the other hand, before investigating the role of the barrier material it is crucial to determine whether there is any TMR effect in the all-antiferromagnetic tunnel junction. Thus, in our calculation, for simplicity we use Mn3Sn for the electrodes and the vacuum for the barrier. In practice, we calculate the tunnelling conductance in the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn MTJ. The MTJ in our calculations is made by stacking Mn3Sn along thecaxis: the conducting path is perpendicular to theabplane of Mn3Sn. The schematics of the MTJ are shown in Extended Data Fig.3a. We calculated transmissions for both parallel and antiparallel configurations; the cluster magnetic octupole moments of the two electrodes point in the same and opposite directions in the parallel and antiparallel configurations, respectively. First, we separate the entire MTJ system into three parts: left and the right leads consisting of the bulk Mn3Sn and the scattering region, comprising a pair of two monolayers of Mn3Sn and the vacuum region between. We performed the DFT calculation with QE for each of the three parts. We set thek-point mesh as 7 × 7 × 7 for the leads and 7 × 7 × 1 for the scattering region. In calculation of the scattering region, the constraint on magnetic moments was imposed to stabilize the magnetic structure. When we calculated the electronic structure of the scattering region in the antiparallel configuration, to smoothly connect the leads and the scattering region in the transmission calculation we treated the doubled scattering region, which consists of the original scattering region and its copy, attached to the original one with its magnetic configuration inverted. In this way we calculated the electronic structure of the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn/Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn system. The doubled scattering region was cut in half and only the original was considered in transmission calculations. Then, connecting the leads and scattering region, we calculated transmission. We set thek⊥= (kx,ky) point mesh in thexyplane as 32 × 32. We obtained transmissions at eachk⊥-point for the parallel/antiparallel configurations,TP/AP(k⊥); conductances for parallel/antiparallel configurations,GP/AP, were determined by the Landauer–Büttiker formula64,65,66,67,\({G}_{{\rm{P/AP}}}=({e}^{2}/h){\Sigma }_{{{\boldsymbol{k}}}_{\perp }}{T}_{{\rm{P/AP}}}({{\boldsymbol{k}}}_{\perp })\). The TMR ratio was calculated as (GP−GAP)/GAP. The vacuum thickness,d, dependence of the total transmission at the Fermi level for the parallel and antiparallel configurations, is shown in Extended Data Fig.3b. We also plotted the resistance-area product (RA) for each configuration, which is the normalized resistance given as (RA) =A/G, whereAis the cross-section area. We found thatGPwas larger thanGAPin all cases ofd, and bothGPandGAPalmost exponentially decayed withd, as shown in Extended Data Fig.3b,c. We thus obtained the positive TMR ratio (Extended Data Fig.3d). Transmissions resolved byk⊥-points are shown in Extended Data Fig.3e,f, which indicates that transmission behaviour does differ between the parallel and antiparallel configurations. For comparison with the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn MTJ, we also investigated the transmission properties of a ferromagnetic MTJ with the vacuum barrier, the Fe/vacuum/Fe system. In the same manner as for the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn MTJ, we calculated electronic structures without spin-orbit couplings of the leads composed by the bulk bcc-Fe with 8 × 8 × 8k-mesh, and of the scattering region which has the vacuum sandwiched between a pair of four monolayers of Fe with 8 × 8 × 1k-mesh. We performed the transmission calculation using 100 × 100k⊥-point grids. Extended Data Fig.3g,hshows thed-dependence of total transmissions and RA values at the Fermi level for both parallel and antiparallel arrangements. The TMR ratio with respect todis plotted in Extended Data Fig.3i, taking as large a value as that in the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn MTJ. The results should be sufficient to serve as a qualitative reference for the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn MTJ, whereas a small non-monotonic change in the TMR ratio was observed, which could converge by the calculation with higher accuracy. The electronic states that dominate tunnelling transport correspond to electrons tunnelling in the normal direction to the interface, and thus the polarization of such states is important for discussion of tunnelling physics68. In fact, the tunnelling conductance of the Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ has the peak atk⊥approximately 0, supporting this concept61,62. In a more complex system such as Mn3Sn, however, the states whose group velocity carries only normal incidence components exist not only atk⊥approximately 0 but also at generalkpoints69, and such states should largely contribute to tunnelling conductance following the concepts proposed by Slonczewski68. Extended Data Fig.3e,fshows the in-plane momentum (kx,ky) dependence of transmission integrated over momentum along the tunnelling direction. Notably, our results clarify that transmission involves not only those states atk⊥approximately 0, but also of the widely extended momentum region in the Brillouin zone. Given that the results in the figures are those projected to the in-plane momentum, tunnelling electrons arise not only from momentumk⊥of approximately 0 related to normal incidence, but rather from entire region of the Brillouin zone. Thus, to qualitatively understand the mechanism of tunnelling conductance, we should focus not only on the states withk⊥approximately 0 but rather use the measure reflecting contributions from the entire Brillouin zone. Given the fact that the antiferromagnetic state of Mn3Sn can be viewed as the ferroic order of cluster magnetic octupole, such a measure should be the summation of octupole polarization over the entire momentum space—the density of states projected onto octupole polarization. We investigated the robustness of transmission properties against variation in interfacial structures in the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn MTJ. We examined two types of variation of the interface: interfacial disorder and lateral shift. First we studied the effect of disorders. We incorporated interfacial disorders into the Mn3Sn/vacuum/Mn3Sn MTJ by artificially moving some atoms facing the vacuum barriers; we shifted upwards one of the Mn atoms in the lower layer of Mn3Sn at the interface, and shifted downwards one of the Mn atoms in the upper layer of Mn3Sn. These atoms were shifted by 0.113 Å—that is, 2.5% of thecaxis length of Mn3Sn, which does not qualitatively change the electronic and magnetic properties of the system. Extended Data Fig.5a–cshows the results of calculations against the disorder with barrier thickness 4.531 Å. Whereas shifting of atoms decreased transmission in the parallel configuration and increased it in the antiparallel configuration, overall transmission properties did not change. We also examined the case in which atoms move inversely to the case above: the atom in the lower layer moved downwards whereas that in the upper layer moved upwards. The results of these calculations (Extended Data Fig.5d–f) suggest that transmission properties did not qualitatively change in this case either. Whereas it is better to use a larger supercell for more precise evaluation of interfacial disorder, we expect that TMR properties may not largely change from those shown here. Second, we examined the effect of lateral shift. Mn3Sn has two layers in a unit cell along thecaxis—say, A and B. In the calculations whose results are shown in Fig.3, layers A and B are at the interface, which we call geometry-I. Here we also consider the case in which two B-layers face each other (see the inset in Extended Data Fig.5i), which we call geometry-II. We show the results of the calculations with geometries-I and II in Fig. 5g–i. These results indicate that the properties in tunnelling conductance do not largely change, whereas total transmissions in geometry-II take larger values than those in geometry-I. We note that for geometry-II we take the doubled unit cell both for the parallel and antiparallel configurations, due to its geometry. We confirmed that the finite TMR effect is observed for other lattice-matching configurations—that is, when two electrodes have differently oriented easy axes of cluster magnetic octupoles by 120° in geometry-I (Supplementary Fig.4). We also examined the TMR effect by shifting the upper layer of Mn3Sn along theaaxis by half of the lattice constanta, and confirmed that this shift qualitatively maintained the TMR effect (Supplementary Fig.5). The bias dependence of TMR can provide useful information about the energy dependence of polarization41. Thus, we performed TMR measurements as a function of bias voltage in the Fe/MgO/Mn3Sn tunnel junction for both the perpendicular (E⊥B) and parallel (E//B) configurations for the electric (E) and magnetic fields (B), corresponding to Fig.3c,d, respectively. In the following, we show the experimental summary for the perpendicular (E⊥B) case as a representative example (Extended Data Fig.6). Extended Data Fig.6a,bshows the minor loops under bias voltage of +0.6 and −0.5 V, in which Fe moments are switched while Mn3Sn moments remain fixed. The key observation is the symmetric bias dependence of the TMR ratio on the perpendicular and parallel configurations (Extended Data Fig.7). This becomes clear if we consider a bias-independent term of the order of around 0.14 % (horizontal dashed line). According to our measurement configuration, the hot electron arises from Mn3Sn and thus MR should reflect the unoccupied DOS of Fe for positive bias (Extended Data Fig.7a). In this regime, the spin polarization of Mn3Sn should be determined by the DOS of Mn3Sn in the vicinity of the Fermi level. Spin polarization around the Fermi level in Mn3Sn is anisotropic and can be characterized by the tensor, as discussed above. Thus, MR should have negative and positive signs for perpendicular and parallel configurations, respectively (Extended Data Fig.7b). This explains the following observations of our experiment. Namely, after subtracting the constant background MR term of around 0.14%, we find that MR has magnitudes similar to the opposite signs for perpendicular and parallel configurations. Bias dependence must arise from the unoccupied DOS of Fe and should be similar to that observed in the Fe/MgO/Fe MTJ5. On the other hand, negative bias should provide the hot electron from Fe to Mn3Sn. Thus, MR would be determined by the spin polarizations of unoccupied DOS for Mn3Sn and DOS for Fe in the vicinity of the Fermi level. As compared with the positive bias regime, MR in the negative bias is strongly bias dependent (Extended Data Fig.7b). This would be due to the bias voltage dependence of the anisotropic spin polarization in Mn3Sn. Interestingly, the MRs for both perpendicular and parallel MTJs converge at around 0.1% at bias V below −0.5. Most probably, this is a result of isotropic spin polarization of Mn3Sn from spin canting. The TMR in Mn3Sn/MgO/Mn3Sn MTJ was measured by variation in MgO thickness. When the barrier became thicker, TMR value increased, consistent with the theoretical calculations shown in Extended Data Fig.2. We also performed a comparison between experiments and calculations, as shown in Extended Data Fig.8. Whereas these calculations use the vacuum barrier, we set thexaxis to be the resistance area rather than MgO thickness itself, for clarity.

The materials known as antiferromagnets were previously demonstrated to store stable memory states, but were difficult to read from. This new study paves an efficient way for reading the memory states, with the potential to do so incredibly quickly too.
You can probably blink about four times a second. You could say this frequency of blinking is 4 hertz (cycles per second). Imagine trying to blink 1 billion times a second, or at 1 gigahertz; it would be physically impossible for a human. But this is the current order of magnitude in which contemporary high-end digital devices, such as magnetic memory, switch their states as operations are performed. And many people wish to push the boundary a thousand times further, into the regime of a trillion times a second, or terahertz.
The barrier for realizing faster memory devices may be the materials used. Current high-speed MRAM chips, which aren’t yet so common as to appear in your home computer, make use of typical magnetic, or ferromagnetic, materials. These are read using a technique called tunneling magnetoresistance. This requires the magnetic constituents of ferromagnetic material to be lined up in parallel arrangements. However, this arrangement creates a strong magnetic field which limits the speed at which the memory can be read from or written to.
“We’ve made an experimental breakthrough that surpasses this limitation, and it’s thanks to a different kind of material, antiferromagnets,” said Professor Satoru Nakatsuji from the University of Tokyo’s Department of Physics. “Antiferromagnets differ from typical magnets in many ways, but in particular, we can arrange them in ways other than parallel lines. This means we can negate the magnetic field that would result from parallel arrangements. It’s thought that the magnetization of ferromagnets is necessary for tunneling magnetoresistance to read from memory. Strikingly, however, we found it’s also possible for a special class of antiferromagnets without magnetization, and hopefully it can perform at very high speeds.”
Nakatsuji and his team think that switching speeds in the terahertz range is achievable, and that this is possible at room temperature too, whereas previous attempts required much colder temperatures and did not yield such promising results. Though, to improve upon its idea, the team needs to refine its devices, and improving the way it fabricates them is key.
“Although the atomic constituents of our materials are fairly familiar — manganese, magnesium, tin, oxygen, and so on — the way in which we combine them to form a useable memory component is novel and unfamiliar,” said researcher Xianzhe Chen. “We grow crystals in a vacuum, in incredibly fine layers using two processes called molecular beam epitaxy and magnetron sputtering. The higher the vacuum, the purer the samples we can grow. It’s an extremely challenging procedure and if we improve it, we will make our lives easier and produce more effective devices too.”
These antiferromagnetic memory devices exploit a quantum phenomenon known as entanglement, or interaction at a distance. But despite this, this research is not directly related to the increasingly famous field of quantum computing. However, researchers suggest that developments such as this might be useful or even essential to build a bridge between the current paradigm of electronic computing and the emerging field of quantum computers.

Abstract:The green algaAegagropila linnaeioften forms spherical aggregates called “marimo” in Lake Akan in Japan. In winter, marimo are exposed to low water temperatures at 1–4 °C but protected from strong sunlight by ice coverage, which may disappear due to global warming. In this study, photoinhibition in marimo was examined at 2 °C using chlorophyll fluorescence and 830 nm absorption. Filamentous cells ofA. linnaeidissected from marimo were exposed to strong light at 2 °C. Photosystem II (PSII) was markedly photoinhibited, while photosystem I was unaffected. When the cells with PSII damaged by the 4 h treatment were subsequently illuminated with moderate repair light at 2 °C, the maximal efficiency of PSII was recovered to the level before photoinhibition. However, after the longer photoinhibitory treatments, PSII efficiency did not recover by the repair light. When the cells were exposed to simulated diurnal light for 12 h per day, which was more ecological, the cells died within a few days. Our results showed new findings of the PSII repair at 2 °C and serious damage at the cellular level from prolonged high-light treatments. Further, we provided a clue to what may happen to marimo in Lake Akan in the near future.Keywords:cell death;chlorophyll fluorescence;Fv/Fm;Lake Akan;low temperature;marimo;PAM;photoinhibition;repair Obara, A.;                     Ogawa, M.;                     Oyama, Y.;                     Suzuki, Y.;                     Kono, M.

Marimo are living fluffy balls of green algae. The world’s largest marimo can be found in Lake Akan in Hokkaido, Japan’s northern main island. Here they are sheltered from too much winter sunlight by a thick layer of ice and snow, but the ice is thinning due to global warming. Researchers found that the algae could survive bright light for up to four hours and would recover if then placed under a moderate light for 30 minutes. However, the algae died when exposed to bright light for six hours or more. The team hopes this discovery will highlight the threat of climate change to this endangered species and the urgent need to protect their habitat.
Some people have pet cats, others pet rocks, but how about pet algae? Marimo are fluffy, squishy green balls of underwater algae which have become popular with tourists, nature enthusiasts and aquarium owners. They range in size from about a pea to a basketball, and form naturally when floating strands of the algaeAegagropila linnaeiare bundled together through the gentle rolling motion of lake water. They are only found in a few countries and the largest marimo, found in Lake Akan, can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. In Japan, they are so popular that they have their own annual festival, merchandise and even a mascot. However, marimo are an endangered species and globally their numbers are generally in decline.
Marimo rely on nutrients and photosynthesis to survive. Their decline is usually attributed to human intervention altering or polluting the freshwater lakes in which they live. However, there has not been much research into the effect of changing access to sunlight. “We know that marimo can survive bright sunlight in warm summer waters, but the photosynthetic properties in marimo at low winter temperatures have not been studied, so we were fascinated by this point,” said Project Assistant Professor Masaru Kono from the Graduate School of Science at the University of Tokyo. “We wanted to find out whether marimo could tolerate it and how they respond to a low-temperature, high light-intensity environment.”
Kono and team visited Lake Akan’s Churui Bay in winter to measure the temperature and light intensity underwater, both with and without ice cover. First, they bored a small hole in the ice 80 meters offshore and then carved a large 2.5 meter-by-2.5 meter square to take readings from. They also carefully collected several marimo balls about the size of a shot put (10-15 cm) by hand. Back in Tokyo, the team recreated the environmental conditions using trays of ice made with an icemaker and white LED lamps. Algae strands were removed from the marimo balls and tested for their normal photosynthetic ability. They were then placed in containers in the ice under the artificial light, which was adjusted to shine at different intensities for different periods of time.
“We demonstrated a new finding that damaged cells in marimo can repair themselves even after exposure to simulated strong daylight for up to four hours at cold temperatures (2-4 degrees Celsius), when followed by moderate light exposure for just 30 minutes. This moderate light had a restorative effect which did not occur in the dark. However, when exposed to strong daylight for six hours or more, certain cells involved in photosynthesis were damaged and the algae died, even after being treated with moderate light,” explained Kono. “These results suggest that photoinhibition (the inability to photosynthesize due to cell damage) would be a serious threat to marimo in Lake Akan, which receives more than 10 hours of sunlight a day in winter, if global warming proceeds and ice cover recedes.”
Next, the team want to find out what would happen to whole marimo balls and whether the outcome would be the same as with the smaller threads. “In the present study, we used dissected filamentous cells, so we did not consider the effects of the structure of the spherical marimo and how it might protect against exposure to bright light. However, if damage to the surface cells increases under longer exposure to the direct sunlight, in an extreme case, this may affect the maintenance of their round bodies and lead to the disappearance of giant marimo. So, we need to constantly monitor the conditions at Lake Akan in the future,” said Kono.
Kono hopes this research will help both local and national governments to understand the urgent need to protect Japan’s unique marimo and their habitat. “We also hope this will be an opportunity for all people to think seriously about the effects of global warming,” he said.

Confining quarks,"We perturbatively compute the Polyakov loop potential at high temperature with finite imaginary angular velocity. This imaginary rotation does not violate the causality, and the thermodynamic limit is well defined. We analytically show that the imaginary angular velocity induces the perturbatively confined phase and serves as a new probe to confinement physics. We discuss a possible phase diagram that exhibits adiabatic continuity from the perturbative confinement to the confined phase at low temperature. We also mention subtlety in the analytical continuation from imaginary to real angular velocity by imposing a causality bound.

This has never been done before and doing so would help answer many fundamental questions in physics. In particular, researchers could use the new approach to determine how matter gets its mass.
The study of matter can seem a bit like opening a stack of Russian matryoshka dolls, each level down revealing another familiar, yet different, arrangement of components smaller and harder to explore than the one before. At our everyday scale, we have objects we can see and touch. Whether water in a glass or the glass itself, these are mostly arrangements of molecules too small to see. The tools of physics (microscopes, particle accelerators, and so forth) let us peer deeper to reveal molecules are made from atoms. But it doesn’t stop there — atoms are made from a nucleus surrounded by electrons.
The nucleus in turn is an arrangement of nucleons (protons and neutrons), which gives the atom its properties and its mass. But it doesn’t end here either; the nucleons are further composed of less familiar things known as quarks and gluons. And it’s at this scale that limits to our knowledge of fundamental physics present a block. As, to explore quarks and gluons, they must ideally be isolated from each other; however, at present, this seems to be impossible. When particle accelerators smash atoms and create showers of atomic debris, quarks and gluons bind again too quickly for researchers to explore them in detail. New research from the University of Tokyo’s Department of Physics suggests we could soon open up the next layer of the matryoshka doll.
“To better understand our material world, we need to do experiments, and to improve upon experiments, we need to explore new approaches to the way we do things,” said Professor Kenji Fukushima. “We have outlined a possible way to identify the mechanism responsible for quark confinement. This has been a longstanding problem in physics, and if realized, could unlock some deep mysteries about matter and the structure of the universe.”
The mass of subatomic quarks is incredibly small: Combined, the quarks in a nucleon make up less than 2% of the total mass, and gluons appear to be entirely massless. So, physicists suggest the majority of atomic mass actually comes from the way in which quarks and gluons are bound, rather than from the things themselves. They are bound by the so-called strong force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, including electromagnetism and gravity, and it’s believed the strong force itself endows a nucleon with mass. This is part of a theory known as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), where “chromo” comes from the Greek word for color, which is why you sometimes hear quarks referred to as being red, green or blue, despite the fact they’re colorless.
“Rigorous proof that the strong force gives rise to mass remains out of reach,” said Fukushima. “The obstacle is that QCD describes things in such a way that makes theoretical calculations hard. Our achievement is to demonstrate that the strong force, within a special set of circumstances, can realize quark confinement. We did this by interpreting some observed parameters of quarks as a new variable we call the imaginary angular velocity. Though purely mathematical in nature, it can be converted back into real values of things we can control. This should lead to a means to realize an exotic state of rapidly rotating quark matter once we learn how to turn our idea into an experiment.”

Although previous studies have constructed fitness landscapes by comprehensively studying the mutations in specific genes, the high dimensionality of genotypic changes prevents us from developing a fitness landscape capable of predicting evolution for the whole cell. Herein, we address this problem by inferring the phenotype-based fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance evolution by quantifying the multidimensional phenotypic changes, i.e., time-series data of resistance for eight different drugs. We show that different peaks of the landscape correspond to different drug resistance mechanisms, thus supporting the validity of the inferred phenotype-fitness landscape. We further discuss how inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes could contribute to the prediction and control of evolution. This approach bridges the gap between phenotypic/genotypic changes and fitness while contributing to a better understanding of drug resistance evolution.

Massively parallel laboratory evolution experiments have revealed an unprecedented amount of information on evolution, including epistatic interactions in genotypic space [4–7], genotype–phenotype mapping [8–14], and the existence of repeatable features in evolutionary processes [8,15–17]. Furthermore, quantitative and theoretical modelling have enabled us to build fitness models based on genotypic and phenotypic data [2,18–20], enabling us to explore the origins of the constraints underlying evolution [21–25]. Despite numerous attempts to describe evolutionary dynamics, predicting and controlling evolution remains difficult. Fitness (or adaptive) landscapes are frequently invoked in experimental and theoretical studies as they offer a basis for the predictability and convergence of evolution [26,27]. Thus, constructing empirical fitness landscapes based on experimental data may be a suitable approach for predicting evolution. Most previous studies on empirical fitness landscapes were based on fitness assays of large mutant libraries for a gene of interest, which revealed broad interactions between mutations and the nonlinearity of the underlying landscapes [4,6,7,28,29]. Despite our accumulating knowledge on how specific mutations affect fitness, we are still far from constructing a comprehensive fitness landscape capable of predicting the evolutionary process of an entire cell. This difficulty is because of the high dimensionality of genotypic space, which makes it difficult to acquire sufficient data for prediction [2,30]. Parallel laboratory evolution experiments have shown that different single nucleotide changes can underlie similar phenotypic changes, implying the existence of multiple paths in the genotypic space to reach a fitted phenotype [14,31–33]. However, phenotypes often exhibit repeatable features in laboratory evolution, implying the low dimensionality of phenotypic space for evolution [2,8,15–18]. Previous studies thus suggest that the fitness landscape may be more traceable when using phenotypes rather than high-dimensional genotypes as its basis. In this study, we aimed to construct an empirical fitness landscape for the evolution of antibiotic resistance inEscherichia coliusing phenotypes as its basis. Our basic strategy was to densely observe multiple phenotypes and their corresponding fitness (i.e., drug resistance) along different trajectories of evolution (Fig 1A and 1B). The observation of trajectories under different antibiotics, starting from different locations in phenotypic space, could allow us to sample sufficient phenotypes to help build the phenotype-fitness landscape. The critical feature of our work is that we used eight different antibiotic resistance values (IC50) as probes for fitness, and their principal components as phenotypes (Fig 1B). As previous studies have suggested, the antibiotic resistance space corresponds to a subspace of the gene expression space, making it a good candidate for probing evolutionary dynamics [14,18]. In addition, antibiotic resistance values can be measured in a high-throughput manner [34], enabling the efficient sampling of phenotypes during the course of laboratory evolution. (A) The experimental conditions used in the current study. We prepared seven starting strains, i.e., the parentE.colistrain, evolved under TET (TETE4, TETE6), evolved under KM (KME1, KME5), and evolved under NFLX (NFLXE4, NFLXE6). Starting from these strains, we performed laboratory evolution under three drugs (TET, KM, and NFLX).

Six out of the seven starting strains had drug-resistant phenotypes, obtained by laboratory evolution over approximately 300 generations [14]. For example, KME1 and KME5 strains evolved from independent culture series under the selection of the antibiotic kanamycin (KM). In our previous study, we confirmed that these strains showed increased IC50values for KM and exhibited cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity to various drugs [14]. In addition to KM-, norfloxacin (NFLX)-, and tetracycline (TET)-resistant strains, we used the parent strain of a previous study,E.coliMDS42, as one of the starting strains. We performed laboratory evolution from these seven starting strains under the selection of three antibiotics: TET, KM, and NFLX (Fig 1A). The daily passage occurred in 384-well microplates for every approximately 10 generations using an automated culture system (seeMaterials and methods). We also quantified the IC50for multiple drugs during every passage to capture phenotypic changes during laboratory evolution. In addition to TET, KM, and NFLX, we adopted the following five drugs (other than antibiotics): sodium salicylate (SS), phleomycin (PLM), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (NQO), sodium dichromate dihydrate (SDC), and mitomycin C (MMC), to characterize the phenotypic changes during adaptive evolution. We selected these drugs to optimize the expressiveness of phenotypic changes during drug resistance evolution, based on the transcriptome and IC50-values of drug-resistant strains obtained in a previous study [14] (seeMaterials and methodsfor details). InFig 1C, we show the time series of IC50for the eight drugs investigated, starting from the KM-resistant strain (KME5) under TET selection; for example, the data of four independent culture lines are overlaid. We performed laboratory evolution for 11 combinations of starting strains and selection drugs (Fig 1A), resulting in 44 trajectories in the eight-dimensional drug resistance space (seeS1 Figfor all time-series data). As shown inFig 1C, selection by TET significantly changed the resistance to other drugs by cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity. For example, the strains presented decreased IC50for KM and PLM when the TET resistance increased, indicating a collateral sensitivity relationship between these drugs. It should be noted that the four independent culture series did not always show similar trajectories for resistance acquisition and loss. For example, the time development of IC50for SDC and MMC inFig 1Cexhibited heterogeneous patterns, wherein one strain acquired SDC and MMC resistance, whereas the other three acquired sensitivity to these antibiotics. The genetic background underlying this heterogeneity in the development of resistance is discussed later. The trajectories in the resistance space revealed a relationship between resistance acquisition and loss for multiple drugs. For example, the two-dimensional TET-KM resistance space showed a trade-off relationship between the KM and TET resistances (Fig 2A). A trade-off relationship between TET and KM has been reported in previous studies [11,14,18]. In contrast to the negatively correlated trajectories in the TET-KM space, resistance to some antibiotic pairs appeared to be acquired independently. InFig 2B, we show the evolutionary trajectories in the NFLX-KM antibiotic resistance space. Here, the evolutionary trajectories that started from NFLX evolution seemed to acquire resistance to KM with little loss of resistance to NFLX and vice versa. The observation that resistance acquisition for NFLX and KM could occur independently suggests that the resistance acquisition mechanisms for the two antibiotics are modular [24].

Because the dynamic ranges of IC50varied among the eight antibiotics, we normalized them and set the mean and standard deviation of the IC50variation among the 44 trajectories over the 27 days of evolution to (mean, standard deviation) = (0,1) before applying PCA. InFig 3A and 3B, examples of evolutionary trajectories are highlighted in two-dimensional PCA space (explained variance ratio PC1:41%, PC2:23%). While most of the strains took similar trajectories, indicating convergence in the phenotypic space, several conditions (such as strains under TET evolution starting from KME1 and KME5) exhibited different evolutionary paths (Fig 3A). This divergence for TET evolution and the underlying genetic backgrounds will be discussed later. To interpret the phenotypes in PCA space, we plotted the IC50values for each antibiotic (Fig 3C–3J). These plots allowed us to visualize phenotypes with high fitness for the corresponding drugs. For example, the phenotypes with high KM resistance were located on the lower-right side of the PCA space, indicating that PC1 is positively correlated with KM resistance (Fig 3D). This tendency is also consistent with the evolutionary trajectories under KM selection (Fig 3B). The results indicate that the phenotypes that were highly resistant to each drug occupied different regions of PCA space.

The inferred landscapes have a small number of peaks for each landscape, suggesting low ruggedness [4,7]. Note that the high noise frequency in the original IC50time series, compared with the mutation acquisition frequency, implies that the noise stems from measurement errors rather than from genotypic ruggedness. (A–H) The phenotype-fitness landscape obtained using Gaussian smoothing for eight drugs is presented. The resistance levels were normalized to a maximum value of one (seeMaterials and methods).

As the raw evolutionary trajectories were subject to experimental noise, we applied a moving average of six time points to the trajectories using a triangular window. The direction provided by the landscapeθlandscape(x) at locationxis calculated as follows:(1)whereF(x) represents the altitude of the phenotype-fitness landscape and ∂/∂xPC1,2is the gradient along the PC1,2 axis (Fig 4I).θv(i), the evolutionary direction in the experimental observations, was calculated from the coordinates of theith time point in the smoothed trajectoriesxPC1,2(i) using(2) InFig 4I, we plotted the distribution of |θv−θlandscape| whereθlandscapewas calculated for each corresponding point along the observed trajectories. For comparison, we also plotted |θv−θrandom|, whereθrandomwas sampled from a uniform distribution [0,2π). As shown inFig 4I, the directions of evolution provided by the inferred landscapeθlandscapehad a significant correspondence with the observed trajectoriesθv(p= 9.23×10−26, one-sided Mann–Whitney U test), suggesting that the inferred landscapes could reproduce the observed evolutionary trajectories. Note that given the fact that each step along the trajectories was defined by time (day) and not by a step in the genotypic space, there were moments where the trajectories stayed at a certain point and whereθvdeviated from the inferred landscapeθlandscape. In addition, the inferred phenotype-fitness landscape was calculated based only on the first two principal components, and the remaining 36% of the variance was not considered. Although we compared the inferred landscape with the trajectories used for the inference process, the two limitations raised above suggest that the correspondence betweenθvandθlandscapewas not trivial. The predictability of the inferred landscapes was evaluated by applying train/test splitting to the whole dataset (S2 Fig). Here, the training dataset was obtained by randomly excluding one out of the four replicates for each experimental condition, resulting in a total of 33 lines, and the excluded 11 lines were used for the test dataset. The phenotype-fitness landscape was inferred using the training data (S2A–S2C Fig) and was compared with the evolutionary directions (θlandscape,train), with experimental observations based on the test data (θv,test) (S2D Fig). The landscape gradients and experimental observations showed significant agreement. Note that this verification for predictability is only possible for the landscape of TET, KM, and NFLX since the laboratory evolution experiments were performed only under these three drugs. However, the landscape properties of the other five drugs might also have similar predictive power due to the tight interconnectedness of drug resistance acquisition relations, which is known as cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity [11,12,14,18]. Overall, the results suggest a correspondence between the landscape-based properties and the experimental observations, indicating the validity and predictive power of the inferred landscapes. One interesting finding in the previous section is that there were two distinct peaks in the TET fitness landscape (Fig 4A). This structure originated from differences in evolutionary trajectories, starting from different initial strains. As shown inFig 3A, most of the trajectories that started from KM evolved strains evolved toward the upper minor peak to increase TET resistance. In contrast, the phenotypes of other TET-resistant strains (e.g., TETE4 and TETE6 starting strains; seeFig 3B) were close to the major peak. This result demonstrates the historical dependence of the evolution of TET resistance. To clarify the genetic mechanism of this historical dependence, we resequenced eight TET-evolved strains starting from KM-evolved strains (four from KME1 and four from KME5) to identify mutation fixation during evolution under TET selection. As shown inTable 1, 7/8 of the resequenced strains had null mutations in the coding region oflon, which encodes Lon protease. These seven strains coincided with the strains that evolved toward the minor peak in the landscape, suggesting that the minor peak observed inFig 4Acorresponds to resistance acquisition caused by alonmutation. It has been previously shown that thelon−mutant shows a low level of multidrug resistance, considering TET, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin (seeTable 1in [35] and [36,37]). We also confirmed the effect of thelonmutation on the parent MDS42 strain, showing that thelon−mutant exhibited a 2-fold increase in IC50for TET [14]. This study also showed that thelon−mutation caused sensitivity to MMC, which is consistent with the fact that the minor peak was located in the MMC-sensitive region (Fig 3J).  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001920.t001 Interestingly, whilelonmutations were identified in most of the TET-evolved strains starting from the KM-resistant phenotype, these mutations were not observed under TET selection when it started from the MDS42 parent strain [14]. In the latter case, mutations in theacrRregulator, which can activate the expression of theacrABefflux pump genes, leading to TET resistance, were commonly identified. Here, the increase in IC50owing to theacrR−mutation was significantly larger than that due to the null mutation oflon[14]. This raises the following question: What makes thelonmutation special for TET resistance when starting from a KM-evolved strain? InE.coli, the uptake of aminoglycosides as KM is positively correlated with the proton motive force (PMF) [38,39]. Indeed, the KM-resistant phenotype in KME1 and KME5 strains was achieved by decreasing PMF to suppress the uptake of KM by null mutations ofcyogenes whose products are involved in the electron transfer system (the identified mutations in KME1 and KME5 are presented in Supplementary Data 3 in [14]). Simultaneously, thesecyomutations result in hypersensitivity to several antibiotics, including TET [14]. This hypersensitivity was caused by the decreased activity of the AcrAB efflux pump, as this pump is a proton antiporter, and its activity is positively correlated with PMF [40,41]. The trade-off between KM and TET resistance is based on these PMF-dependent changes in the efflux and uptake activities of drugs [11,42]. In the present study, the KM evolved strains withcyomutations did not acquireacrRmutations under TET selection, probably because of the decreased fitness gain ofacrRmutations after the fixation of thecyomutations. Specifically, increasing the activity of the AcrAB efflux pump by theacrRmutation is difficult under the decreased activity of the electron transfer system bycyomutations. As an alternative strategy, in KME1- and KME5-evolved strains,lonmutations increased TET resistance. Although the detailed mechanism by whichlonmutations contribute to TET resistance is unclear, one possible mechanism can be related to the stabilization of the transcriptional activator MarA, which is the substrate of the Lon protease [36,43], and subsequent activation of themarRABoperon. It was recently shown that the activation of themarRABoperon can cause antibiotic resistance through the acidification of the cytoplasm [44]. This previous study also showed that acidification-based drug resistance was independent of changes in PMF. These results suggest that this acidification-related resistance phenotype is a possible strategy for KME1- and KME5-evolved strains to achieve TET resistance under decreased PMF throughcyomutations. It should be noted that one out of eight TET-evolved strains starting from KM-evolved strains had no mutation inlon. The evolutionary trajectory toward this strain exhibited a different direction of phenotypic change (denoted by the arrowhead inFig 3A) compared with the other seven trajectories. We confirmed that this strain had acquired mutations inacrA,rpoA, andatpB. The identified V45I mutation inacrAcorresponded to the MP domain of AcrA, which transmits conformational changes in AcrB to TolC [45]. Given these results, we speculate that this strain acquired resistance to TET by improving the activity of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump through anacrAmutation and not through thelonmutation. We inferred the fitness landscapes of phenotypic changes (Fig 4) and determined their consistency with the observed evolutionary trajectories. The next step was thus to utilize the landscape to control evolution. The basis of the inferred phenotype-fitness landscape was given by the two principal components calculated from the IC50values of the eight drugs. This means that if we monitor the resistance of the eight drugs during the course of evolution, we may be able to compute their location in the phenotype-fitness landscape and thus predict the direction of evolution for each specific cell state of resistance. Thus, combining the inferred landscape with antibiotic resistance monitoring may allow the control of drug resistance. To demonstrate an example of controlling evolution, we performed a simulation on the inferred landscapes using a gradient ascent-based algorithm. In the simulation, the time evolution of the cell state in the PCA spacex= (xPC1,xPC2) under phenotype-fitness landscapeF(x) is given as follows:(3)(4)whereηdenotes the step size for each time step.ξ(t) is given by white Gaussian noise andMis the amplitude of the noise. Parameters (η,M) were estimated from the experimental trajectories.η= 0.4 andM= 0.3 were estimated from the median change in IC50per day observed in the 44 evolution trajectories under drug selection and in parent strains without drug selection, respectively. InS3A Fig, we show the simulated trajectories compared to the corresponding experimental trajectories to validate the estimated simulation parameters. With some exceptions (e.g., KME5 under TET selection), the simulation results show a qualitative agreement with the experimental trajectories. To validate the simulations quantitatively, we measured the mean distanceLbetween the simulated and experimental trajectories using(5)(6)wherexexp,i,jandxsim,i,j,nnare the coordinates of the experimental trajectory of thejth copy for dayiand the nearest neighbor toxexp,i,jwithin the simulated trajectory, respectively. We comparedLwith Brownian motion with the same noise parameterMfor 20 independent runs in each environment (e.g., parent under TET selection). The estimates given inS3 Figshow that the simulations were significantly better than random trajectories (S3B Fig;p= 4.66×10−17, one-sided Mann–Whitney U test), validating the precision of our simulation parameters. With the validated parameters, we evaluated whether we could construct the desired evolutionary trajectories using the simulation by dynamically changing the selection drugs.Fig 5shows an example of controlling the evolutionary trajectory in the phenotypic PCA space. Here, we started from the parent strain under KM selection (see the leftmost panel). The gray boxes indicate the thresholds for the switching environments. Under the assumption of monitoring IC50values for the eight antibiotics used to construct the PCA space, we would be able to keep track of evolution in the space, which would allow us to know when the strain crosses over a threshold. As shown inFig 5, by switching environments based on thresholds, we could create a cycle of evolution in the PCA space. Note that the inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes were constructed based on laboratory experiments with a limited number of genetic backgrounds, and, thus, evolutionary trajectories starting from different genetic backgrounds might deviate from these landscapes since the different combination of mutations could alter the landscape structure [46,47]. Such alterations in the landscape structure could be detected through discrepancies between the original inferred landscape and experimental trajectories, leading to novel insights of evolutionary constraints, their relations with the strain’s genetic (or nongenetic) background, and the construction of a more robust phenotype-fitness landscape. We should emphasize here that inferred landscapes combined with evolutionary algorithms such as gradient ascent can generate protocols for laboratory evolution and produce various hypotheses for investigating evolutionary constraints. We believe that our inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes based on phenotypic PCA space can open new avenues for predicting and controlling evolution. The gray boxes represent the thresholds set to switch environments. The title for each panel shows the name of drug used for selection.

We demonstrated that the multiple peaks in the landscape corresponded to different antibiotic resistance mechanisms (Fig 4). We also showed that the directions of evolution predicted by the inferred phenotype-fitness landscape correspond to the directions observed in the experimental trajectories (S3 Fig). This result suggests that the inferred landscapes can predict the direction of evolution ofE.coliat least for evolution under TET, KM, and NFLX. We also demonstrated how the inferred landscapes, combined with resistance monitoring, could control the trajectories of antibiotic resistance evolution (Fig 5). Our results are promising for predicting and controlling evolution using phenotype-based empirical fitness landscapes. An important aspect of this study is that we inferred the fitness landscape based on antibiotic resistance profiles and not genotypes. Although previous studies have focused on constructing fitness landscapes based on mutations for a few genes [4,6], because the number of possible genotype changes (e.g., nucleotide changes) associated with antibiotic resistance evolution is immense [32], empirical fitness landscapes based on genotypes were not capable of predicting/controlling evolution. Instead, building on recent experimental studies reporting that evolution leads to better convergence of phenotypes than that of genotypes [2], we proposed a phenotype-fitness landscape using the multidimensional antibiotic resistance profiles acquired during the course of evolution. We showed that the inferred phenotype-based fitness landscapes provided directions of evolution that were consistent with the observed trajectories, suggesting that resistance profiles can capture the internal degrees of freedom ofE.colifor predicting evolution. Note that the space spanned by the resistance profiles corresponds to a subspace of high-dimensional space spanned by gene expression profiles [14]. Indeed, mutations conferring drug resistance have a wide spectrum and if these various mutations lead to different directions of phenotypic changes (i.e., high dimensionality of the phenotype-fitness map), it would be difficult to predict them precisely using the phenotype-fitness landscape in this study. However, previous laboratory evolution studies suggest high repeatability and a rather deterministic structure, implying the low dimensionality of the phenotype-fitness map [8,14–16,18]. For such cases, the phenotype-fitness landscape should be capable of predicting drug resistance evolution. In this study, we used eight different antibiotics to estimate the internal state ofE.coli. Of course, we may need more antibiotics to probe evolutionary dynamics when using different antibiotics as selection pressures owing to, for example, cryptic genetic variation [20,48]. A sufficient number of antibiotics to probe the internal degree of freedom ofE.coliremains an open question, and we should be able to answer this by, for example, elucidating the resistance-gene expression map through extensive laboratory evolution experiments using various antibiotics with strains that have different genetic backgrounds. A related limitation of this study is that the properties of the inferred landscapes could be susceptible to the inclusion of new data, such as evolution time-series under other drugs. For example, the TET landscape has a double peak structure (Fig 4A), which is supported mainly by the eight trajectories of the “KME1 in TET” and “KME5 in TET” datasets. InS4 Fig, we show how the landscape structure changes when we remove the dataset under TET selection from the landscape inference. While the double peak structure is conserved inS4A and S4B Fig, in which a part of datasets was removed, the minor peak inS4C Figdisappeared when data in all trajectories under TET selection were removed. These results suggest that the properties of the phenotype-fitness landscape can change with the inclusion of new datasets, such as trajectories starting from evolved strains under other drugs. Because this susceptibility is caused by the lack of sufficient data, a more robust landscape is expected to be obtained through the collection of a sufficient number of experimental conditions and replicates, which should be addressed in future studies. The inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes provided a rich space for hypothesizing the direction of evolution. InFig 5, for example, we showed that switching antibiotic environments can lead to a cycle of antibiotic resistance states in the PCA space. Whether this evolutionary cycle is realizable in laboratory evolution systems thus needs to be determined. Although evolutionary constraints lead to repeatable outcomes, their robustness and the conditions under which constraints change remain unclear [47,49]. Changes in the genetic background during evolution may lead to different peaks in other landscapes, which could disturb the proposed evolutionary cycle. Interestingly, the inferred landscape of TET showed a small local peak that could not be observed when PCA was applied to the strains that directly evolved from the parent MDS42 strain, suggesting that the local peak in the TET landscape might have been accessible only after the acquisition of KM resistance through the decrease in PMF. Resequencing analysis, which revealed the involvement oflonin the local TET peak, supported this hypothesis. Taken together, our results show that changes in evolutionary constraints during the course of evolution can be detected through inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes. Using inferred landscapes as hypothesis generators and laboratory evolution as a test ground could open a novel avenue for evolutionary biology, enabling the efficient investigation of the robustness and variation of evolutionary constraints. The insertion sequence (IS)-freeE.colistrain MDS42 [50] was purchased from Scarab Genomics (Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and used as the parent strain for this study. The utilization of IS element-free strains allows reliable resequencing analyses when using short-read sequencers. In addition, to analyze evolutionary trajectories from different initial states, we used six evolved strains obtained from our previous laboratory evolution starting from the same MDS42 strain [14]. These evolved strains were isolated from the end-point culture after 27 days of serial dilutions of TET (TETE4, TETE6), KM (KME1, KME5), and NFLX (NFLXE4, NFLXE6) [14].E.colicells were cultured in a modified M9 minimal medium containing 17.1 g/L Na2HPO4·12H2O, 3.0 g/L KH2PO4, 5.0 g/L NaCl, 2.0 g/L NH4Cl, 5.0 g/L glucose, 14.7 mg/L CaCl2·2H2O, 123.0 mg/L MgSO4·7H2O, 2.8 mg/L FeSO4·7H2O, and 10.0 mg/L thiamine hydrochloride (pH 7.0) [51]. In addition, 15 μg/mL erythromycin (approximately 1/10-fold of the IC50ofE.coliMDS42) was added to M9 medium throughout the experiments to avoid contamination by other bacterial species. Cell cultivation, optical density (OD) measurements, and serial dilutions were performed for each antibiotic using an automated culture system [34] consisting of a Biomek NX span-8 laboratory automation workstation (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA) in a clean booth connected to a microplate reader (FilterMax F5; Molecular Devices, San Jose, California, USA), shaking incubator (STX44; Liconic, Mauren, Liechtenstein), and microplate hotel (LPX220, Liconic). Three different antibiotics, TET, KM, and NFLX, were used for laboratory evolution (Fig 1A). The antibiotics were diluted in modified M9 medium with a 20.25-fold gradient in 384-well microplates, with 45 μL medium in each well. The OD620values of the precultures were measured using an automated culture system and diluted so that OD620= 0.00015. Then, 5 μL of diluted cultures were inoculated into 45 μL of medium in each well in the 384-well microplates and cultivated under agitation at 300 rotations/min at 34°C. Every 24 h of cultivation, cell growth was monitored by measuring the OD620of each well, where we set OD620> 0.09 as the parameter for cell growth. The automated culture system selected the well with the highest concentration of the antibiotic in which cells could grow for transfer. The cells in the selected well were diluted to OD620= 0.00015 and transferred to a fresh plate containing fresh medium and antibiotic gradients. In parallel with laboratory evolution, IC50was determined for eight drugs: TET, KM, NFLX, SS, PLM, NQO, SDC, and MMC (Fig 1B). These eight drugs were selected to maximize the expressiveness of the phenotype space spanned by the antibiotic resistance profiles. To determine this combination of drugs, we performed a regression assessment to predict the 4,492 gene expression profiles of the 192 evolved strains in [14] from the IC50values of TET, KM, NFLX, and five random drugs of the corresponding strains. The combination of the five drugs was determined through a genetic algorithm [18] using prediction accuracy as the fitness, which led to the selection of SS, PLM, NQO, SDC, and MMC. This analysis suggests that the combination of IC50values for the above eight drugs represents the phenotypic changes that occurred during laboratory evolution under various stress conditions. To determine IC50values, serial dilutions of each drug were prepared in 384-well microplates using modified M9 medium with 20.25-fold (TET, KM, NFLX) or 20.5-fold (SS, PLM, NQO, SDC, MMC) chemical gradients in 22 dilution steps. Culture conditions for IC50determination were the same as those for laboratory evolution: OD620values of the cultures were measured after 24 h of cultivation in 384-well microplates containing serially diluted antibiotics. To obtain the IC50values, the OD620values for the dose–response series were fitted to the following sigmoidal model:(7)wherexandf(x)represent the concentration of antibiotics and observed OD620values, respectively.a,b,c, and IC50are fitting parameters fitted using theoptimize.curve_fitusing the SciPy package [52]. We followed the protocols for genome sequence analyses using the Illumina HiSeq System, as described in [53]. A 150-bp paired-end library was generated according to the Illumina protocol and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Potential nucleotide differences were validated using BRESEQ (Bowtie v2.3.4.1, R v3.6.3) [54]. As shown inFig 3C–3J, the maps of individual antibiotic resistance values in the PCA space obtained using eight-dimensional evolutionary trajectories are reminiscent of the phenotype-fitness landscape. However, this simple scatter map is still different from what can be identified as a fitness landscape for several reasons. To solve these problems, we averaged and discretized the data and performed smoothing via a Gaussian kernel thereafter. Below, we show the details of this process and how multiple experimental trajectories of evolution were converted to an empirical phenotype-fitness landscape. First, the resistance values were averaged from the scatter map. The entire space was discretized into square grids with a defined grid size, and the antibiotic resistance values of all points within the same grid were averaged. Here, grids with no points inside were assigned a NaN value. Because the grid size defines the level of coarse graining in this procedure and affects the later smoothing process, we defined the grid size through the Freedman–Diaconis rule to reduce arbitrariness. The Freedman–Diaconis rule is a statistical heuristic method to select the bin widthbwfor constructing a histogram by(8)where ICR(x) andnare the interquartile range and the sample size of the given dataset, respectively. We applied the Freedman–Diaconis rule to the PC1 values of the data points in the PCA space, which led to a grid size of 0.519. Although the discretized and averaged fitness maps provide unique fitness values for the observed points in PCA space, we still could not acquire fitness values for unobserved points using this discretized map. Therefore, we applied a convolution operation to the discretized map using a Gaussian kernel (Gaussian smoothing). Here, we aimed to acquire a smoothed functionF(x)from the discretized and averaged map of resistancewhereXjdenotes thej-th grid. A smoothed functionF(x)can be acquired via Gaussian smoothing using(9)(10)whereandhare the normalization factor and bandwidth of the Gaussian kernel, respectively. Here, we assumed that PC1 and PC2 are independent and thus acquired the smoothed functionF(x) spanning across the two-dimensional PCA space byF(x) =F(xPC1)·F(xPC2). This smoothed functionF(x) provides fitness values for both observed and unobserved points. In addition, the derivative ofF(x) provided the gradient at each point in the PCA space, which could be used to predict the direction of evolution. Therefore,F(x) can be interpreted as a phenotype-fitness landscape inferred from the observed evolution trajectories. An important hyperparameter for Gaussian smoothing is the bandwidthh. Ifhis too large, the fine structure of the underlying landscape may be destroyed. However, ifhis too small, experimental noise would dominate the inference process, worsening the predictions from the inferred landscape. Therefore, we definedhafter a 4-fold cross-validation. For each fold, 3/4 of the non-NaN grids in the discretized map were randomly chosen to infer the phenotype-fitness landscape using Gaussian smoothing, and their accuracy was measured by calculating the mean squared error (MSE) between the normalized resistance values of the remaining 1/4 grids. Using 4-fold cross-validation, a grid search was performed forhfrom 0.26 to 1.5 (using the PCA space) for all eight antibiotics. As a result,h= 0.42 yielded the minimal MSE for the TET landscape andh= 0.47 yielded the minimal MSE for the other seven antibiotics. Therefore, we useh= 0.47 for the analysis in this study.

PLOS is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, #C2354500, based in San Francisco, California, US","Antibiotic resistance, when infection-causing bacteria evolve so they are no longer affected by typical antibiotics, is a global concern. New research at the University of Tokyo has mapped the evolution and process of natural selection ofEscherichia coli(E. coli) bacteria in the lab. These maps, called fitness landscapes, help us better understand the step-by-step development and characteristics ofE. coliresistance to eight different drugs, including antibiotics. Researchers hope their results and methods will be useful for predicting and controllingE. coliand other bacteria in the future.
Have you ever felt queasy after eating an undercooked burger? Or when leftovers from yesterday’s dinner were left out of the fridge a bit too long? There are many different kinds of food poisoning, but one common cause is the growth of bacteria such asE. coli. Most cases ofE. coli, though unpleasant, can be managed at home with rest and rehydration. However, in some instances, it can lead to life-threatening infections. If you have a bacterial infection, antibiotic medication can be a powerful and effective treatment. But antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to become strong enough that it does not respond to the medication, is a serious global concern. If antibiotics are no longer effective, then we will once again be at risk of serious illness from small injuries and common ailments.
“The development of methods that could predict and control bacterial evolution is crucial to find and suppress the emergence of resistant bacteria,” said researcher Junichiro Iwasawa, a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Science at the time of the study. “Thus, we have developed a novel method to predict drug resistance evolution by using data obtained from laboratory evolution experiments ofE. coli.”
The researchers used a method called adaptive laboratory evolution, or ALE, to “replay the tape” on the evolution of drug-resistantE. colito eight different drugs, including antibiotics. The method enabled the researchers to study the evolution of bacterial strains with specific observable characteristics (called phenotypes) in the lab. This helped them gain insight into what changes might occur to the bacteria during the longer-term process of natural selection.
“While conventional laboratory evolution experiments have been labor intensive, we mitigated this problem by using an automated culture system that was previously developed in our lab. This allowed us to acquire sufficient data on the phenotypic changes related to drug resistance evolution,” explained Iwasawa. “By analyzing the acquired data, using principal component analysis (a machine-learning method), we have been able to elucidate the fitness landscape which underlies the drug resistance evolution ofE. coli.”
Fitness landscapes look like 3D topographic maps. The mountains and valleys on the map represent an organism’s evolution. Organisms at the peaks have evolved to have better “fitness,” or ability to survive in their environment. Iwasawa explained, “The coordinates of the fitness landscape represent inner states of the organism, such as gene mutation patterns (genotypes) or drug resistance profiles (phenotypes), etc. Thus, the fitness landscape describes the relation between the inner states of the organism and its corresponding fitness levels. By elucidating the fitness landscape, the progression of evolution is expected to be predictable.”
The team believes the fitness landscapes it has mapped in this study and the methods developed in the process will be useful for predicting and controlling not onlyE. coli, but also other forms of microbial evolution. The researchers hope this will lead to future studies that can find ways to suppress drug-resistant bacteria and contribute to the development of useful microbes for bioengineering and agriculture. Iwasawa concluded that “the next important step is to actually try using the fitness landscapes to control drug resistance evolution and see how far we can control it. This can be done by designing laboratory evolution experiments based on the information from the landscapes. We can’t wait to see the upcoming results.”

All previously reported flower colour changes are unidirectional, except for an incomplete case in one Fabaceae species. In this study, we discovered a very rare example of complete oscillating flower colour change associated with sexual phase changes inCausonis japonica(Vitaceae). More specifically, flower discs ofC. japonicaexhibit an orange colour in the initial male phase then soon fade into pink with desorption of the stamens. Several hours later in the daytime of the same or the following day, with stigma maturation and style elongation, the orange flower disc colour is recovered before fading into pink again. Importantly, we found that the colour change is caused by the accumulation and the degradation of carotenoids. Moreover, nectar secretion was roughly correlated with the abovementioned colour changes. This is the first example of an apparent oscillating colour change mediated by carotenoid content alteration in flowers. Flower colour change with flower age is widely observed in more than 450 species of many families of angiosperms. Such changes are generally believed to represent a service to pollinators, particularly insects, as they enhance the attractiveness of flowers at the rewarding stage for pollinators, which is also beneficial for pollination1(reviewed in2). Whether flower colour changes occur simply as a service to pollinators has been actively debated (e.g.,2). Recently, Ito et al.3mathematically proved that such ‘honest signals’ are evolutionarily stable only when flowers are visited by pollinators with both high and low learning abilities. Moreover, temporal flower colour changes are generally unidirectional with time; thus, reversal changes have never been observed4. One exceptional case, inDesmodium setigerumE. Mey. (Fabaceae), which exhibits a flower colour shift from lilac to turquoise after pollination, indicated a partial flower colour reversal from turquoise to purple when flowers received little or no pollen5. Therefore, understanding the variations in flower colour changes is a key aspect of pollination ecology. Causonis japonica(Thunb.) Raf. (=Cayratia japonica(Thunb.) Gagnep.) is a perennial vine weed that is widely distributed from the temperate to tropical zones of East Asia, Southeast Asia, India, and Australia6. In Japan, this species develops protandrous flowers (ca. 5 mm in diameter) from June to August7,8and is often a target of weed control in agriculture. A previous work reported thatC. japonicasecretes nectar twice a day and that bagging prohibited fruiting, indicating that that it requires pollinators to bear fruits7. Many insect species, including ants and wasps, were reported to visitC. japonicaflowers; among the 121 collected visitors, two individuals ofApis ceranawere confirmed to carry pollen grains7. Based on the above observations, Kakutani et al.7postulated that the diurnal nectar secretion might be synchronized with the flower visiting pattern ofA. cerana.They also described that flower disc colour ofC. japonicachanged from red to “orange or pink”; therefore, this flower colour change was assumed to be unidirectional7. However, during field observations, one of the authors (YF) found that the flower disc colour change ofC. japonicais not unidirectional. Here, we describe the first case of complete flower colour recovery via a reversal colour change correlated with the sexual phase or with nector production, and demonstrate that this colour change is due to altered carotenoid contents. We also discuss that this oscillating colour change might represent a typical ‘honest signal’ for pollinators. Time-course observations on 43 flowers ofCausonis japonicarevealed changes in flower disc colour and sexual expression (Table1). Temporal changes in floral features showed no difference between diploid (19 flowers) and triploid (24 flowers) individuals. For example, flowering onset times did not differ substantially between ploidy level (diploid: from 07:07 to 13:27, triploid: from 06:58 to 14:49). However, the flowering duration varied significantly from flower to flower, ranging from a minimum of one day to a maximum of six days. Regardless of the ploidy level, all flowers with damaged styles (14 flowers) exhibited brown stigmas after the male phase, then ceased floral development prior to the female phase. Figure1shows the typical time-course changes ofC. japonicaflower features (flower ID 35 in Table1) according to the RGB values (representing the activities of nectar secretion: see below). As in the other 42 examined cases shown in Table1, the initial colour of this flower disc immediately after anthesis (male phase) was orange (Stage 1, Fig.1a, RGB: 255, 88, 16), as reported earlier7. Immediately after the petals and stamens fell off, the flower disc colour changed to pink (Stage 2, Fig.1b, RGB: 255, 82, 102). The styles were not yet elongated at this stage, and the flowers were asexual. In 12 cases with damaged styles and brown stigmas, the flower discs remained pink until the flowers fell off (shown as “O–P” in Table1). Colour change process of a flower disc inCausonis japonica(flower ID 35 in Table1). Disc colour changed from orange (a, RGB: 255, 88, 16) to pink (b, RGB: 255, 82, 102) before recovering to orange (c, RGB: 255, 88, 16) again, then pink (d, RGB: 255, 120, 94) again. In the last stage, the flower disc turned brownish pink (e, RGB: 232, 162, 169) then fell off. The two orange colour stages were synchronised with flower sexual activity. (a) First orange stage shows stamen activity (male phase); (c) second orange stage indicates stigma maturation (female phase). Nectar secretion was active only in the orange stages and more active in the female phase; the same tendency was observed in the other cases shown in Table1. However, in the remaining 31 flowers with normally elongated styles, maturation of the styles (female phase) coincided with the flower discs again exhibiting a distinct orange colour (Stage 3, Fig.1c, RGB: 255, 88, 16). After the female phase, the flower discs turned pink again (Stage 4, shown as “O–P–O–P” in Table1), and brownish colouration appeared in the stigmas (Fig.1d, RGB: 255, 120, 94). Finally, the flower discs turned to a faded pink (Fig.1e, RGB: 232, 162, 169) just before the flowers fell off. Therefore, the above observations imply that colour-change has a strict correlation with sexual phase. The timings of the disc colour change to the second orange stage (female phase) varied depending on the onset time of each flower. Most flowers that opened before 10:00 reached the second orange stage (female phase) on the afternoon of the same day (except for two flowers, ID 1 and 2 in Table1). Conversely, flowers that bloomed after 10:00 reached the second orange stage (female phase) at approximately noon the following day. These flowering processes were not fully synchronised in the same inflorescence; therefore, pink and orange discs often coexisted in the same inflorescence. Indeed, we can collect various stages of flowers at a time point from one population as shown in Fig.2a. Histology of floral discs ofC. japonica.(a) Floral disc colour change observed in a triploid individual. Flowers were hand-sectioned along the longitudinal axis to show inside colouration of floral disc. Floral phase was judged from the stigma length and colour of the stigma tip; from left, initial stage with orange floral disc and short style, first pink stage with short style, second orange stage with elongated style with matured stigma, and second orange stage with elongated style. Unit of scale bar = 1 mm. (b–e) Longitudinal sections of floral discs in the initial orange stage (b,d) and pink stage (c,e). Scale bar = 500 µm. (b,c) Hand sections of living floral discs showing pigmentation of vacuoles in some scattered cells. (d,e) Resin-embedded sections of floral discs showing histology. Figure1also shows the typical time-course changes of nectar activities (flower ID 35 in Table1), which indicates active nectar secretions during both orange colour stages. That is, the flower discs secreted nectar in both male and female phases, with no visible nectar secretion in the pink stages. Moreover, nectar secretion in the female phase of this flower was higher than that in the male phase, a tendency that was also observed in other flowers; however, the total volume of nectar varied among the flowers shown in Table1. During anthesis, we confirmed that bees, wasps, ants and other insects visited the flowers as previously described7(Supplementary Fig.1). Longitudinal sections of flowers in the pink-coloured and orange-coloured stages (Fig.2a) revealed that pigmentation occurred only in a subset of parenchymatous cells in both cases (Fig.2b, c). No structural or cytological changes were observed between the initial orange stage and the pink stages (Fig.2d, e), suggesting that the observed oscillating colour change depends on the degradation and biosynthesis of orange pigments. To understand what pigments are involved in the dual colour change of theC. japonicaflower disc, we extracted carotenoids and chlorophyll with Acetone. Anthocyanin was also extracted with Methanol-HCl. As a result, while anthocyanin content was not significantly altered throughout the stages examined, we found that carotenoid level strongly correlated with the colour change detected by naked eye. More specifically, in stages 1 and 3 the carotenoid content was high (63.8 and 65.3 µg/g dry weight, respectively), but significantly decreased in stages 2 and 4 (14.3 and 36.5 µg/g dry weight, respectively) (Table2). Interestingly, an increase in chlorophyll content was confined to stage 4 (Table2). Together, the observed dual colour change was ascribed to the decrease (stage 2) and the increase (stage 3) of carotenoid contents in the flower discs. In this study, we discovered the first example of complete flower colour recovery associated with sexual phase inCausonis japonica.Pigment quantification indicated that the colour changes are correlated with degradation and resynthesis of carotenoid within a short period. This phenomenon itself is astonishing. To date, and to the best of our knowledge, such rapid and repeated cycle of synthesis and degradation of carotenoid has not been recognized. This phenomenon is, on the other hand, highly reasonable if we assume that the orange flower disc displays a reward to pollinators that results in selected visits to flowers in sexually active phases. Indeed the colour change is also correlated with nectar production although the total nectar amount varied among flowers. This is, at least in part, due to environmental factors. For instance, atmospheric humidity has been previously reported to severely affect nectar volume7. Hence, it can be said that the presence/absence of nectar is strongly correlated with sexual/asexual phases and also with floral disc colour changes. Past report identifiedApis ceranaas the meaningful pollinating insect ofCausonis japonica7. Because this bee has a highly sensitive blue photoreceptor againstca.450 nm wavelength that corresponds to the absorption peak of carotenoids9, it is highly plausible that bees can recognize the aforementioned colour changes. But whether the colour differences are discriminated by floral visitors in a strict sense is not yet examined and is a future issue. Nectar secretion was most active in the male and female phases (7and this study). High nectar secretion in the female phase suggests that nectar may be more important as a reward for pollination of this species because no pollen grain is offered as a reward. Indeed, most active visitors were wasps, which prefer nectar far more than pollen grains7. This phenomenon might represent a type of mimicry between male and female flowers that is typically observed in the genusBegonia10(reviewed in2,11). In this case, it can be understood as sexual mimicry in dichogamy. Anyway, it is necessary to examine the difference in the spectral reflections throughout the bee-visible spectrum including UV among four phases, and to test whether the pollinators recognize the flower colour changes as a strong cue to distinguish nectar-rich flowers at sexual stages from nectar-poor flowers at asexual stages in the near future by bee behavioral analyses. Interestingly, although all flowers of diploid and triploid individuals investigated in this study exhibited essentially the same process, the second disc colour change was not observed in several flowers that were accidentally damaged, for example, by wind. This might indicate that the second colour change (activation of carotenoid biosynthesis) is physiologically linked to pistil maturation. An important topic for future research is determining whether this link is mediated by phytohormones. What is the mechanism of the oscillating colour change inC. japonicaflower discs? Histological and pigment quantitative-based analyses indicated that the flower colour disc changes were caused by the degradation (from orange to pink) and re-biosynthesis (from pink to orange) of carotenoids in a subset of parenchymatous cells. These colour changes occurred over approximately one day; therefore, rapid repression and reactivation of carotenoid biosynthesis/degradation enzymes are speculated as the cause. Furthermore, because plant pigmentation is regulated at the transcriptional level in general (e.g.,12), some mRNA species of a key enzyme in the biosynthesis/degradation  of carotenoids would be regulated in concert with the sexual phases inC. japonica.In angiosperms, many carotenoid biosynthesis/degradation  genes have been identified recently. Interestingly, the activity of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) is known to be responsible for colour polymorphism of many plant species. For example, CCDs activity prescribes the difference of fruit flesh colour between white and yellow peach13. It is also known that some azalea and petunia cultivars highly accumulate carotenoid in young floral buds, but later in anthesis carotenoid disappears. This was found to be regulated by CCD4 expression at later stage of floral bud development14,15. Thus, examination of CCDs expression levels in floral discs ofCausonis japonicais one of the future directions. In this study, we discovered a new type of flower colour change in both diploid and triploid strains ofC. japonicadistributed on Honshu Island, Japan. Previously, we revealed that many haplotypes of AsianC. japonicaexhibit morphological differentiation; these haplotypes have mutually hybridised to result in some hybrids with low fertility6. The most abundant individual on Honshu Island is the triploid line, with most biological research onC. japonicaconducted on this triploid. Several morphological types are recognised in Japan, with some populations found in the Ryukyu Islands named asC. tenuifolia(Wight & Arn.) Gagnep., which are characterised by yellow flower disc and fruits with a flattened obpyriform16,17,18(Supplemental Fig.2). These morphological types are all involved in theCayratia japonica–Cayratia tenuifoliaspecies complex (orCausonia japonica–Causonia tenuifoliaspecies complex)6, which is distributed widely from the temperate to tropical regions of East Asia, Southeast Asia, India, and Australia, with many halotypes differentiated. As described by Ishikawa et al.6and Okada et al.16, the colour of the flower disc immediately after anthesis in the male phase varies among haplotypes (Supplemental Fig.1). In China and Indonesia, it can be yellow, orange, or red; in Australia, it is lime green (Supplemental Fig.1). Most haplotypes seem to fix their floral disc colour, suggesting that the oscillating colour change reported in this study occurs only in particular haplotypes ofC. japonica.Here, we focused on triploid and diploid strains found on Honshu Island that exhibit red–orange or orange flower discs in the male phase. Interestingly, closely relatedC. maritima(Jacks) Jacks andCayratia yoshimurai(Makino) Suess. & Suess. have white and green flower discs, respectively (Supplemental Fig.2). Because these two species were revealed to be basal against all otherC. japonicahaplotypes6, ancestral flower disc colour ofC. japonicais speculated to be white or green. Taking this into account, the orange-coloured flower disc display is a novel trait that have probably evolved during the diversification ofC. japonica-tenuifoliaspecies, whereby the acquisition of periodical carotenoid synthesis, degradation and resynthesis in the flower discs is an evolutionary innovation. Therefore, future studies should analyse other haplotypes with different flower disc colours in order to reveal the evolutionary processes of complete flower colour changes in theC. japonica–C. tenuifoliaspecies complex. BecauseC. japonicais often regarded as a target of weed control in agricultural fields, no conservation regulation is applied to this species in Japan. But all the experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. According to previous literature7, the flowers first develop an orange or red flower disc in the male phase, which lasts only 2 h. The flowers then lose their stamens and petals and change their disc colour to orange or pink. Finally, several hours after the beginning of anthesis, the flowers shift into the female phase with an elongated style and a matured stigma7. In this species, diploid (2n = 40) and triploid (2n = 60) plants often coexist13. Therefore, we used flowers (or inflorescences) from both diploid and triploid individuals selected at intervals of 10 m or more because vegetative reproduction by the roots of this species is known to be vigorous16. To analyse temporal colour changes of the flower discs, we conducted time-course observations in the field on 43 flowers (19 flowers of seven diploid individuals and 24 flowers of eight triploid individuals) using both the naked eye and digital cameras at Gifu University campus (Gifu city, Gifu Prefecture, Japan). Field observations of the flowers were conducted in two seasons (from 12th July 2015 to 24th August 2015 and from 8th August to 8th October 2016). In addition, observations of the flowers of three triploid individuals collected in Kakamura city, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, were performed in a room after cutting during August 2021. Time-lapse photographic records were performed approximately every 20 min using a digital camera (STYLUS TG-3, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Colours were calibrated using the sample sheets of the DIC Colour Guide (19th ed. 2008)19. Flower disc colour was evaluated via visual comparison with the DIC Colour Guide sheets for conversion into RGB values (RGB triplet: red, green, blue). Time-course nectar volume measurements were conducted on the same individuals at Gifu University campus using micro-capillary tubes (Drummond MIUROCAPS 1μL or HIRSCHMANN ringcaps 1.2.3.4.5 μL). Histological observations were conducted for flowers collected in Hongo campus of the University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan) in 2022, by embedding samples in Technovit 7100 resin (Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) after fixation with FAA [5% (v/v) acetic acid, 45% (v/v) EtOH, and 5% (v/v) formalin] overnight (or longer) and sequential dehydration with ethanol, as described in previous literature20. Resin-embedded specimens were sliced by Leica Rotary Microtome (Leica microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). 3–6 μm thick histological sections of were placed on cover slips, stained with 0.1% (w/v) toluidine blue in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), dried, and mounted on glass slides with Entellan new rapid mounting medium (EMD, Millipore, USA). Microscopic observations were performed using a light microscope (LEICA DM4500 B; Leica microsystems). Flower discs ofC. japonicawere sliced out from each flower with razor blades. Each sample set included more than 30 flower discs. Samples were freeze-dried overnight by FDU-2100 Freeze drier (EYELA, Tokyo, Japan), and then crashed into powder with plastic pestle. Pigment extraction was carried out on 0.01-g dried powder for each sample set with 0.5 mL acetone. After agitation under room temperature for more than 15 min, samples were centrifuged and supernatants were used for spectrophotometry measurements (Hitachi U-3010, Tokyo, Japan). Scan for spectrophotometry was done from 350 to 800 nm; calculation of chlorophyll a/b and carotenoid was done after Wellburn21. Data are available on request from the authors (HT and KN). Weiss, M.

Its flowers can change color depending on the stage of its maturation cycle, and then change back to its original color. Although many flowers have been shown to change color depending on their maturation phase,Causonis japonicais the only known example of bidirectional color change. The pigments involved in the colors are related to nutrient-rich colorful vegetables, so understanding the flowers’ color-changing tricks could have downstream applications in improving nutrient yields in certain food crops.
We all like flowers, and one of the most appealing things about flowers is presumably the wide array of shapes, sizes and, of course, colors they come in. But did you know that some flowers can change their colors? Although it’s not all flowers, this trait has been observed in hundreds of different species for at least a number of decades. It’s thought that color-changing flowers do so because it signals to pollinating insects that the flower is ready to supply nectar or pollen which rewards them. This is considered to be an “honest” signal. But the reverse can also be seen; some plants show a “dishonest” signal, with some of their flowers displaying their default color whilst others display their signal color. That behavior is thought to increase the overall visibility of the plant from a distance to would-be pollinators. But whatever the strategy of the plant in question, all examples of color-changing flowers found have been unidirectional: Once the color has changed, it does not change back. So, imagine the surprise University of Tokyo Professor Hirokazu Tsukaya must have felt when he saw a flower of the plantCausonis japonicachange color, and then, change again, and again.
“Even though I’ve studied this plant in detail, having discovered there were at least two varieties back in 2000, the bidirectional color-changing flowers were a completely unexpected finding,” said Tsukaya. “My colleague Professor Nobumitsu Kawakubo from Gifu University is an expert in time-lapse, long-period video recordings of pollinating flowers. He and his student originally tried to explore the pollinating behaviors between the different kinds ofCausonis japonicaand expected to see the familiar change from its default orange color to bright pink. But they couldn’t believe it when they reviewed the time-lapse video and saw that it not only changed back to orange again, but that this change oscillated between the two states. They informed me on this finding; this compelled us to find out why. So we started a collaboration.”
Thanks to the carefully captured time-lapse videos from the field and detailed observations in the laboratory, Tsukaya managed to connect what physiological changes took place in the flowers concurrent with their changes in colors.
“The initial orange state is coincident with the male stage of the flower’s maturation, when it is secreting nectar,” said Tsukaya. “When the stamen — male part — becomes old and detaches, the flowers turn pink. Mere hours later, the pistil — female part — begins to mature, secretes nectar, and the flower turns orange again. Once that stage is over, the flower fades to pink. The main chemical responsible for the color changing is orange-yellow carotenoid; its cycle of accumulation and degradation is also the fastest known to date. That fact was another surprise to us.”
You probably noticed the chemical name carotenoid sounds a little like the word carrot. This is not a coincidence, as the same chemical is what gives typical carrots their orange hue. It’s a good source of vitamin A, and given the color-changing flowers show the most rapid accumulation of carotenoids ever seen, it’s no surprise the researchers think their discovery might have some future application in developing carotenoid-containing vegetables that mature faster or contain higher yields of beneficial vitamins.
“Our next steps will be to find out what is governing the behaviors we have observed,” said Tsukaya. “One big question we have is, at what level are the stages of the cycles regulated? Is it caused by proteins caught in a feedback cycle, or does something occur on a genetic level? We will continue to explore this and hope to find an explanation soon. It’s strange to think that several hundred years ago, agriculturalists in Japan hatedCausonis japonicabecause of its vigorous nature. But a novelist, Kyoka Izumi, wrote about them so favorably, I wonder if it helped maintain some interest in preserving them. Whatever the reason, I’m glad they are around now to share their secrets with us. I wonder what we’ll discover next.”

The synchronous increases in3He/4He at some fumaroles suggest an increase in magmatic gas supply since 2018. The increase in magmatic gas supply is also supported by the temporal variations in3He/CO2ratios and carbon isotopic ratios of CO2. The3He/40Ar* ratios (40Ar*: magmatic40Ar) show significant increases in the period of high3He/4He ratios. The temporal variation in3He/40Ar* ratios may reflect changes in magma vesicularity. Therefore, the3He/40Ar* ratio of fumarolic gases is a useful parameter to monitor the current state of degassing magma, which is essential for understanding the deep process of volcanic unrest and may contribute to identifying precursors of a future eruption. These results provide additional validation for the use of noble gas and carbon isotopic compositions of fumarolic gases for monitoring magmatic–hydrothermal systems. The compositions of volcanic gases reflect deep to subsurface volcanic processes such as degassing from magma, incorporation of shallower components, and vapor–liquid separation1. Hence, volcanic gases provide direct information about a magmatic‒hydrothermal system beneath a volcano. The3He/4He ratios of volcanic gases (up to ~ 8 RAin Japan2, where RAdenotes the atmospheric3He/4He ratio of 1.4 × 10−6; ref.3) are sometimes lower than the3He/4He ratio in the mantle (7–9 RA4) due to the incorporation of crustal He with a low3He/4He ratio of ~ 0.01–0.02 RA5. The low crustal3He/4He ratio is due to4He production by the decay of U and Th. Since the proportion of magmatic and crustal He in volcanic gases may vary in response to magmatic gas flux,3He/4He ratios might be useful for monitoring volcanic activity. For example, pre-eruptive3He/4He ratio increases have been reported at some volcanoes, suggesting that an increase in magmatic He contribution could precede the eruptions6,7,8. Some fractions of CO2in fumarolic gases might be added by shallow processes after degassing from magma, such as decarbonation of crustal limestone9,10. The relative contributions of major CO2sources in fumarolic gases can be estimated by combining the3He/CO2ratios and carbon isotopic ratios of CO211. Although some physicochemical processes at shallow depths can modify both parameters, the spatial-temporal variations in3He/CO2ratios and carbon isotope ratios of CO2have been used to monitor volcanic activities and understand the structures of magmatic‒hydrothermal systems12,13,14,15,16,17. Some temporal variations in the relative abundances of volatile species in magmatic gases have been attributed to solubility-controlled fractionation that correlates with the vesicularity of degassing magma13,15,16,18,19,20. Since noble gases such as He and Ar are chemically inert, their abundance ratios are not affected by any chemical process. Thus, the temporal variations in magmatic3He/40Ar* ratios (40Ar*:40Ar corrected for the atmospheric contribution) in volcanic gases may reflect a change in the state of degassing magma. To investigate the applicability of these isotopic parameters to monitoring the magmatic‒hydrothermal system of the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano, we have repeatedly measured the concentrations and isotopic compositions of noble gases and CO2in fumarolic gases since 2014. Kusatsu-Shirane is an active stratovolcano that consists of three pyroclastic cones: Mt. Shirane, Mt. Ainomine, and Mt. Motoshirane, where phreatic eruptions frequently occur21. The presence of an electrically conductive structure at depths of 1–3.5 km broadly extending from beneath Mt. Shirane to Mt. Motoshirane has been detected by magnetotelluric surveys (Fig.1), and this structure has been interpreted as a fluid reservoir supplying magmatic‒hydrothermal fluid to fumaroles and hot springs22,23,24. Because of its frequent eruptions and long-term multiparameter observations of volcanic activity21,25,26,27,28, Kusatsu-Shirane is one of the best case study fields for monitoring a magmatic‒hydrothermal system. Map of the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano. White circles are the locations of fumaroles where samples were collected for this study. A white star indicates the location of the phreatic eruption on 23 January 2018. Yellow circles show the Kitagawa geothermal area located on the northern flank of Mt. Shirane. The red area indicates the horizontal extent of electrical conductor “C2”, which is probably a hydrothermal fluid reservoir beneath the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano23. The base map is from the website of the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (https://maps.gsi.go.jp/). Fumarolic gases were repeatedly sampled at three fumaroles in the Kitagawa geothermal area (Kitagawa fumaroles W, C, and E), the Sesshogawara fumarole (S) on the eastern side of the volcano, the Manza fumarole (M) on the western side of the volcano, and the Motoshirane fumarole (MS) on the eastern side of Mt. Motoshirane (Fig.1and Supplementary Fig.S1). The sampling periods are between July 2015 and April 2021 for the W and E fumaroles, between October 2016 and April 2021 for the C fumarole, between October 2014 and April 2021 for the Sesshogawara fumarole, and between March 2018 and April 2021 for the Manza fumarole. The Motoshirane fumarolic gas was sampled on 11 August 2020. In this paper, we discuss following topics based on the fumarolic gas compositions at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano: (1) temporal variations in magmatic gas supply based on3He/4He ratios; (2) CO2sources feeding fumaroles based on spatial–temporal variations in3He/CO2ratios and carbon isotopic compositions; and (3) temporal variations in magma vesicularity based on3He/40Ar* ratios. The noble gas and CO2concentrations, He, Ne, and Ar isotopic ratios, and13C/12C ratios of CO2in the fumarolic gas samples are listed in Supplementary TableS1. The13C/12C ratios are shown in the delta (δ) notation as parts per thousand deviations (per mil, ‰) from the international Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard. Five samples were collected as residual gases (R-gases) in Giggenbach-type bottles (see “Methods” section  and Supplementary TableS1). Since noble gas concentrations in the residual gases increase due to the adsorption of acidic gases (such as CO2and H2S) into the KOH solution in the bottles, those samples are excluded from the discussion about noble gas concentrations. All measured3He/4He ratios (2.5–8.1 RA) are significantly higher than the atmospheric value, indicating the presence of mantle He. The (3He/4He)corrratios (air-corrected3He/4He) are calculated using the4He/20Ne ratios (Eqs.1and2). The (3He/4He)corrratios for Kitagawa fumaroles W (6.7–8.0 RA), C (6.2–8.1 RA), and E (7.1–8.0 RA) are generally higher than those for the Sesshogawara (6.4–7.8 RA) and Manza (5.3–7.4 RA) fumaroles (Supplementary TableS1). The (3He/4He)corrratio of the Motoshirane fumarolic gas (8.5 ± 2.1 RA) may be similar to those of the other fumaroles, although it has a large error due to the correction for significant atmospheric contamination. Because of the significant atmospheric contamination, the Motoshirane sample is excluded from the following discussions unless otherwise noted. According to Eq.3,3Heaircontributes less than 9% of the sample3He. Since the high (3He/4He)corrratios indicate crustal3He is negligible, the3He of most samples is dominantly derived from magma. Figure2shows the temporal variations in the (3He/4He)corrratios for the Kitagawa, Sesshogawara, and Manza fumaroles, along with the monthly numbers of earthquakes at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano. The dotted lines in Fig.2a–c indicate a phreatic eruption that occurred at Mt. Motoshirane on 23 January 201829. The temporal (3He/4He)corrvariation patterns for the three Kitagawa fumaroles W, C, and E are roughly synchronized. The (3He/4He)corrratios increased in May 2018, decreased in October 2018, and then progressively increased. We separated the study period since July 2015 into four intervals based on the averages of (3He/4He)corrratios for the three Kitagawa fumaroles (Fig.2b). In periods I (July 2015–November 2017) and III (October 2018–August 2018), the average (3He/4He)corrratios were lower than the arbitrarily determined value of 7.8 RA. In periods II (May 2018–August 2018) and IV (October 2019–April 2021), the average (3He/4He)corrratios were higher than 7.8 RA. Period IV might have continued after the most recent sampling in April 2021.

The Roman numerals above the panel are periods defined by the average (3He/4He)corrratios of the Kitagawa fumarolic gases. High average (3He/4He)corrratios (> 7.8 RA) were measured in periods II and IV. (b) (3He/4He)corrratios measured at the Sesshogawara (S) and Manza (M) fumaroles, and the averages of W, C, and E fumaroles. (c) Numbers of volcanic earthquakes per month in all areas of Kusatsu-Shirane (white) and near Mt. Motoshirane (red). The earthquake data are provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency. Dotted lines indicate 23 January 2018, when a phreatic eruption occurred at Mt. Motoshirane. The range of temporal variations for the Sesshogawara fumarole is smaller than that for the Kitagawa fumaroles except for the episodic drop in February 2018, three weeks after the 2018 eruption. The volcanic gases before the eruption were not sampled at the Manza fumarole. The (3He/4He)corrratios for the Manza fumarole progressively increased after the eruption until June 2018. In June 2019, the (3He/4He)corrratio episodically decreased and recovered in the next month. The δ13C-CO2values for the Kitagawa fumaroles W, C, and E varied in the ranges of − 4.4 to − 1.4‰, − 4.9 to − 1.6‰, and − 4.2‰ to − 1.8‰, respectively. Those for the Sesshogawara and Manza fumaroles varied in the ranges of − 4.5 to − 0.8‰ and − 3.7 to − 0.5‰, respectively. The3He/CO2ratios for the Kitagawa fumaroles W, C, and E significantly varied in the ranges of (0.3–1.6) × 10−10, (0.5–1.7) × 10−10, and (0.4–1.5) × 10−10, respectively. Those for the Sesshogawara and Manza fumaroles show relatively minor variations that are in the ranges of (0.3–0.7) × 10−10and (0.3–0.5) × 10−10, respectively. The3He/CO2ratios of the W, C, and E samples collected on the same date are similar, and high in the periods II and IV when the (3He/4He)corrratios were high (Supplementary Fig.S2c). Figure3shows3He/CO2versus δ13C-CO2diagrams. All data points are plotted within the region defined by the three-component mixing of the MORB-type mantle11,30, limestone-derived CO211, and organic-derived CO211(Fig.3). The3He/CO2ratios and the δ13C-CO2values for the three Kitagawa fumaroles show a negative correlation (Fig.3b). On the other hand, the3He/CO2ratios and the δ13C-CO2values for the Sesshogawara and Manza fumaroles are poorly correlated (Fig.3c). 3He/CO2versus δ13C-CO2diagrams for the fumarolic gas samples.

The ranges of δ13C-CO2values for mantle (− 4‰ to − 9‰), organic carbon (− 20‰ to − 40‰), and limestone (− 2‰ to 2‰) are after ref.11. The estimated δ13C-CO2value (1.1‰) for Kusatsu-Shirane crustal CO210is also shown. Black lines are the mixing lines between mantle composition and organic-derived CO2, and mantle composition and limestone-derived CO2. Figure4shows the40Ar/36Ar versus38Ar/36Ar diagrams. The black line is a mass fractionation line for the atmospheric Ar3. Most data points are plotted above the atmospheric mass fractionation line, indicating that those fumarolic gases contain excess40Ar (i.e.,40Ar*), that may originate in the mantle or crust where radiogenic40Ar has been produced by the decay of40K. The sample38Ar/36Ar ratios show negative anomalies up to ~ 1.6% relative to the air. The anomalies reflect mass fractionation because the mantle38Ar/36Ar ratio is almost indistinguishable from the atmospheric value3. Because such isotopic shifts should be parallel to the atmospheric mass fractionation line, the40Ar* concentrations are calculated from the vertical deviations from the atmospheric mass fractionation line using Eqs.4and5. Some samples have large40Ar* errors or no resolvable40Ar excess due to significant contributions of atmospheric Ar. Ar three-isotope diagrams for the fumarolic gas samples collected at the W, C, and E fumaroles in the Kitagawa geothermal area, and the Sesshogawara (S) and Manza (M) fumaroles. The air composition of (38Ar/36Ar,40Ar/36Ar) = (0.188, 296) and a mass fractionation line for the atmospheric Ar are also shown3. The40Ar* concentrations in the Kitagawa samples are higher than ~ 0.8 ppm (Supplementary TableS1). Assuming that the crustal4He/40Ar ratio is ~ 6 (a typical production ratio in the crust5), the crustal40Ar concentrations in the samples are estimated from the crustal4He concentrations. Assuming that the (3He/4He)corrratios reflect a simple two-component mixing of the crustal and magmatic He with3He/4He ratios of 0.02 RA4and 8.1 RA(the highest (3He/4He)corrratio in this study), respectively, crustal4He concentrations in all the samples are estimated. Accordingly, the crustal40Ar in the samples should be less than 9% of their total40Ar*. Therefore, the most40Ar* of the Kitagawa samples are derived from the magma containing mantle Ar. Some Sesshogawara and Manza samples also contain detectable40Ar*. The crustal40Ar in these samples contributes less than 7% of their total40Ar*. In summary, both3He and40Ar* in the samples are mostly magmatic in origin. Because of their inertness, the3He/40Ar* variations of the fumarolic gases may directly reflect the3He/40Ar* variations of magmatic gas. Some3He/40Ar* ratios have large errors due to the large uncertainties of40Ar*. In order to examine the3He/40Ar* variation properly, we used the3He/40Ar* ratios with < 70% errors in the following discussion. These are 35 of the 63 samples for which Ar isotopic compositions were measured. Figure5shows temporal variations in the3He/40Ar* ratios for the Kitagawa, Sesshogawara, and Manza fumaroles along with the3He/40Ar* ratios of the fumarolic gases collected at the Kitagawa geothermal area in 2000–2001 ((0.1–0.3) × 10−4; calculated from the literature data31). The3He/40Ar* ratios for the three Kitagawa fumaroles synchronously varied in the range of (0.2–1) × 10−4, and the3He/40Ar* ratios were high during the high (3He/4He)corrperiods II and IV (Fig.5). The3He/40Ar* ratios for the Sesshogawara fumarole were almost stable in the range of (0.1–0.3) × 10−4. The3He/40Ar* ratios for the Manza fumarole were (0.02–0.1) × 10−4. Temporal variations in the3He/40Ar* ratios of fumarolic gases. (a)3He/40Ar* ratios measured at the W, C, and E fumaroles in the Kitagawa geothermal area and those of fumarolic gases collected in the same area in 2000–200131. Gray areas highlight the periods of high magma vesicularity, which are suggested by increased3He/40Ar* ratios. (b)3He/40Ar* ratios measured at the Sesshogawara (S) and Manza (M) fumaroles. The Roman numerals above the panels are periods defined by the average (3He/4He)corrratios of the Kitagawa fumarolic gases (see text for details). Samples with uncertainties of more than 70% in the3He/40Ar* ratios are not shown. Dotted lines indicate 23 January 2018, when a phreatic eruption occurred at Mt. Motoshirane. As previously mentioned, the (3He/4He)corrratios of the fumarolic gases reflect the mixing of magmatic and crustal He. The synchronous temporal variations in the (3He/4He)corrratios for the three Kitagawa fumaroles suggest that they are fed by a common volcanic gas reservoir. The highest observed (3He/4He)corrratio of 8.1 RAindicates that the3He/4He ratio of the Kusatsu-Shirane magma is ~ 8.1 RAor higher. This is in the range of the3He/4He ratios of mid-ocean ridge basalts (7–9 RA4). Therefore, the Kusatsu-Shirane magma is almost unaffected by crustal He. The (3He/4He)corrratios for the Sesshogawara and Manza fumaroles are lower than those for the Kitagawa fumaroles, reflecting a greater influence of crustal He. The average (3He/4He)corrratio of the Kitagawa fumarolic gases since May 2018 (~ 7.8 RA) is higher than that before November 2017 (~ 7.2 RA). The increase in (3He/4He)corrratios can be explained by an increase in magmatic He supply or a decrease in crustal He supply. For the Kitagawa fumaroles, the former is more likely because this is consistent with the enrichments in magmatic gas species (such as CO2and He) in the fumarolic gases since May 201828. Thus, the magmatic gas supply may have become more substantial since sometime between November 2017 and May 2018. This view is supported by previous reports of shallow inflation and more volcanic earthquakes around Mt. Shirane since April 2018, three months after the 2018 eruption21,25(Fig.2c). The enhanced volcanic activity may reflect the supply of magmatic fluid from a magma chamber, a potential pressure source for deep inflation at a depth of ~ 4 km since 201821,26. It should be noted that some previous studies proposed a mixing of two magmatic components with different3He/4He ratios to explain (3He/4He)corrvariations of volcanic gases15,32,33,34. In this case, one component with a higher3He/4He ratio may originate from a primitive magma. The other component with a lower3He/4He ratio may originate from an aged magma, which might have experienced crustal contamination and magma aging that can lower the3He/4He ratio15. However, this may not be the case for the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano, where the3He/40Ar* and3He/CO2ratios are low when the (3He/4He)corrratio is low (Fig.5and supplementary Fig.S2c). This relationship is opposite to the expected composition of aged (more degassed) magma, which should have higher3He/40Ar* and3He/CO2ratios because the solubilities of Ar and CO2in silicate melt are lower than He35,36. The magmatic gas supply might have been especially large during periods II (May 2018–August 2018) and IV (October 2019–April 2021) when relatively high (3He/4He)corrratios are observed. This is supported by the recent variation in the Cl concentration of the Yugama crater lake, suggesting an increase in the supply of magmatic fluid in 2018 and 202027,37. This result confirms that the (3He/4He)corrratio is an excellent parameter to monitor the temporal variations in magmatic gas supply at a volcano with a well-developed hydrothermal system that may interfere with the compositions of other chemically reactive magmatic gas species, as has been previously proposed by the studies at the other volcanoes6,7,8. At the Sesshogawara and Manza fumaroles, significantly low (3He/4He)corrratios were measured after the phreatic eruption in 2018 (Fig.2), suggesting a decrease in the magmatic/crustal He ratios in response to the eruption. The synchronous responses may reflect that both fumaroles are connected to the hydrothermal fluid reservoir that caused the phreatic eruption at Mt. Motoshirane21. This is consistent with a magnetotelluric study23that suggested the presence of a hydrothermal fluid reservoir (the C2 conductor in Fig.1) broadly spread beneath the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano. During the 2018 eruption, fluid injection from the hydrothermal fluid reservoir to shallower depths was suggested from ground deformation recorded by a borehole tiltmeter network at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano21. The low (3He/4He)corrratios after the eruption might indicate that the hydrothermal fluid in the deeper part of the fluid reservoir is more influenced by crustal He than the shallower part, which constantly supplies fluid to the fumaroles. In this case, the fluid with a low3He/4He ratio might have been temporarily supplied from the deeper part to the fumaroles. Another process that would lower the (3He/4He)corrratios is a decrease in the hydrothermal fluid supply to the fumaroles. A previous study reported a gradual decrease in the (3He/4He)corrratios of fumarolic and hot spring gases with distance from the center of volcanic activity at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano (i.e., the Yugama crater lake), indicating the continuous addition of crustal He during the transport of hydrothermal fluid10. Since the hydrothermal fluid is the carrier of magmatic He with a high3He/4He ratio, the3He/4He ratios of fumarolic gases would become lower when the fluid supply decreases. The low (3He/4He)corrratio was measured at the Manza fumarole alone in June 2019. In this case, the scenario of low-3He/4He fluid injection is less likely because it would also result in a low (3He/4He)corrratio at the Sesshogawara fumarole. Therefore, the low (3He/4He)corrratio in June 2019 suggests a decrease in the hydrothermal fluid supply to the Manza fumarole. Some physicochemical reactions such as (1) vapor–liquid separation, (2) pH-related CO2-HCO3−equilibrium, and (3) carbonate precipitation can modify3He/CO2and δ13C-CO2values of volcanic gases at a magmatic‒hydrothermal system2,10,38,39. For our samples, (2) and (3) are ruled out because both require medium to high-pH conditions, although the magmatic‒hydrothermal fluid of the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano is strongly acidic (pH < 3.2)10,27,40. The (1) vapor–liquid separation may cause the3He/CO2fractionation due to the lower solubility of He than CO2in aqueous fluid41. However, because the bulk of the volatiles partition into the gas phase, the3He/CO2ratios of the sampled gas phase are expected to approach that of the fluid before vapor–liquid separation2. Accordingly, the3He/CO2and δ13C-CO2variations may not be attributable to the fractionation due to the above reactions. The Kitagawa fumarolic gas compositions show a negative correlation in the3He/CO2versus δ13C-CO2diagram, and the data points with lower3He/CO2ratios distribute toward the limestone-derived CO2composition (Fig.3b). A previous study reported that δ13C-CO2values of volcanic gases from the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano increase with distance from the Yugama crater, suggesting the shallow assimilation of crustal CO2produced by decarbonation of the limestones with a δ13C-CO2value of 1.1‰ around the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano10. Therefore, the negative correlations most likely reflect the mixing of the magmatic gas and the crustal CO2with various proportions (Fig.3b). This view is supported by the fact that the high3He/CO2ratios were observed in the periods II and IV when the (3He/4He)corrratios were high, reflecting large magmatic gas contribution (Supplementary Fig.S2). Note that the3He/CO2and δ13C-CO2values of the magmatic gas are probably fractionated during magmatic degassing as discussed later. For the Sesshogawara and Manza fumaroles, the lower3He/CO2ratios than the Kitagawa fumaroles suggest smaller magmatic CO2contributions. This is consistent with the lower (3He/4He)corrratios for both fumaroles (Fig.2), indicating smaller contributions of magmatic He. The δ13C-CO2variations of more than a few ‰, independent of the3He/CO2ratios, may reflect the addition of various amounts of organic-derived CO2at shallow depths. The soil CO2from some parts of the Satsuma-Iwojima volcano mainly consists of biogenic CO2with a low δ13C-CO2of − 27‰42. Similar soil CO2dissolved in meteoric water is a potential source of the organic-derived CO2since the incorporation of meteoric water has been suggested from the elemental and isotopic compositions of the Sesshogawara and Manza fumarolic gases28. The fractionation of3He/40Ar* ratios in the gas phase during vapor–liquid separation should be minimal for our samples because the solubilities of He and Ar in water are similarly low, and the difference is much smaller than those of He and CO25,41. Therefore, the3He/40Ar* ratios in the fumarolic gases are expected to be almost identical to the magmatic gas composition. The3He/40Ar* ratios of the Kitagawa fumarolic gases have episodically increased since May 2018. The highest ratios were ~ 5 times the pre-eruptive value of ~ 3 × 10−5in 2017 (Fig.5). In addition, the3He/40Ar* ratios of (1–3) × 10−5in 2000–200131were similar to the pre-eruptive value. Since the volcano had been calm between 1991 and 201443,44, these values indicate that the3He/40Ar* ratios were low during low volcanic activity. Volatiles in a gas phase separated from a silicate melt are fractionated as functions of solubilities and melt vesicularity. Volatiles with lower solubilities are more partitioned into the gas phase, and the degree of elemental fractionation decreases with increasing vesicularity1,45. Figure6shows the fractionations of He/Ar and He/CO2ratios in the gas phase of an anhydrous basaltic magma as functions of magma vesicularity in a closed system (computed from Eq. (6) in “Methods” section). Since the solubility of Ar in a silicate melt is lower than He35, the He/Ar ratio in the gas phase is low when the magma vesicularity is small. Although the solubility difference between He and Ar may decrease when the H2O concentration in a silicate melt is higher, the solubility of He is always higher than Ar46. Therefore, the increase in3He/40Ar* ratios is attributable to the enhanced vesicularity of the degassing magma. This inference is supported by the compositional trend for Kitagawa samples showing a linear correlation in the3He/40Ar* versus3He/CO2diagram (Fig.7) because a vesicularity-controlled fractionation trend is expected to be linear. For example, the vesicularity-controlled fractionation trend for the gas phase of a magma with a composition of “A”, calculated from Eq.6and the parameters used for Fig.6, yields the straight line in Fig.7. The enhanced magma vesicularity is consistent with an increase in the magmatic gas supply since 2018, inferred from the (3He/4He)corrratios. Another process that would potentially change the3He/40Ar* ratios is a mixing of two (or more) magmatic components with different compositions. However, this is less likely because two-component mixing yields a curved correlation in the3He/40Ar* versus3He/CO2diagram, as demonstrated by the mixing curve between “A” and “B” in Fig.7, which is different from the trend for the Kitagawa samples. He/Ar and He/CO2fractionations in the gas phase during closed system degassing of basaltic melt. Black lines show the fractionation lines computed using Eq.6with assumptions that the solubilities of He, Ar, and CO2in the melt are 5.7 × 10−4cm3STP g−1bar−1, 6.4 × 10−5cm3STP g−1bar−1, and 2.9 × 10−4cm3STP g−1bar−1, respectively35,36. The initial He/Ar and He/CO2ratios in magma are 1. See “Methods” section for details. 3He/40Ar* versus3He/CO2diagram for the fumarolic gas samples. Samples with uncertainties of more than 70% in the3He/40Ar* ratios are not shown. The straight line shows a relationship between3He/40Ar* and3He/CO2ratios in the gas phase of a magma with a composition of “A” as a function of magma vesicularity. The relationship is computed using Eq.6with assumptions that the solubilities of He, Ar, and CO2in the magma are 5.7 × 10−4cm3STP g−1bar−1, 6.4 × 10−5cm3STP g−1bar−1, and 2.9 × 10−4cm3STP g−1bar−1, respectively35,36. The dashed curve represents a two-component mixing curve for gases with compositions of “A” and “B”. The points “A” and “B” are on the linear regression line for the Kitagawa fumarolic samples with the maximum (1.7 × 10−10) and minimum (6.8 × 10−11)3He/CO2ratios, respectively. The linear correlation also indicates that the3He/CO2variations in the Kitagawa fumarolic gases during the periods of high3He/CO2ratios (> ~ 1 × 10−10) mainly reflect vesicularity-controlled fractionation, suggesting that the CO2is mostly magmatic during these periods. The highest3He/CO2ratio (~ 1.7 × 10−10) is much lower than the MORB-type mantle value ~ 6 × 10−10(ref.30) despite the most3He is also magmatic in origin. The low3He/CO2ratios support the previous study that suggested the3He/CO2ratio of the Kusatsu-Shirane magma is lower than the MORB-type mantle value due to the addition of CO2derived from subducted materials11. The δ13C-CO2values of the Kitagawa samples with high3He/CO2ratios (> ~ 1 × 10−10) have a wide range from − 4.9 to − 2.0‰. It is known that the δ13C-CO2exsolved from the magma is fractionated to a few ‰ heavier value than that in the melt47. The δ13C-CO2variation may reflect a complex fractionation during magma degassing. However, it cannot be excluded that the variation is due to the assimilation of organic-derived CO2at shallower depths like that proposed for the Sesshogawara and Manza fumaroles. Noble gases are minor volatile species in magma and do not affect vesiculation. Instead, the enhancement in magma vesicularity occurs when the magma is depressurized or the concentrations of major volatile species in the magma (e.g., H2O and CO2) increase. The depressurization of magma may be caused by magma ascent or breakdown of a self-sealed zone (Fig.8), which is mainly formed by the precipitation of silica at the brittle‒ductile transition zone (370–400 °C) around the magma and may induce overpressure27,28,48. On the other hand, the increase in the volatile concentration may be caused by an addition of volatile-rich magma or a decrease in the melt volume as a result of crystallization. However, the former process is less likely because the long-term decreasing trend of the SO4/Cl ratio of the Yugama crater lake since early 2000s is inconsistent with an intrusion of new magma that may cause an increase in the SO4/Cl ratio27. The latter process is inconsistent with the rapid enhancement in magma vesicularity because crystallization is a continuous process during the entire magma cooling history18. Therefore, depressurization due to magma ascent or breakdown of a self-sealed zone might have caused the enhancement in magma vesicularity in periods II and IV. Schematic illustration for the magmatic-hydrothermal system at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano. Black arrows indicate fluid supplies from a magmatic–hydrothermal fluid reservoir. Abbreviations: Vp, vapor phase; Lq, liquid phase. Here, we summarize a possible scenario for the temporal variations in the magmatic gas composition at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano since 2014. The enhancement in magma vesicularity started in April 2018 and increased the3He/40Ar* ratio of the gas exsolved from the magma. Then, magmatic gas with a high3He/40Ar* ratio was supplied to the Kitagawa fumaroles, resulting in the episodic increases in the3He/40Ar* ratios observed in period II (Fig.5a). The enhanced magma vesicularity also increased the magma gas supply, resulting in high (3He/4He)corrratios (Fig.2a). The low3He/40Ar* ratios in period III suggest a short-term decrease in magma vesicularity, possibly due to pressurization by magma descent or growth of a self-sealed zone27,28,48. The high3He/40Ar* ratios in period IV indicate that the magma vesicularity increased again. Figure8shows a schematic illustration of the magmatic–hydrothermal system at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano that summarizes the discussion above. The hydrothermal fluid reservoir broadly extending beneath the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano23may supply magmatic–hydrothermal fluid to the fumaroles around the volcano. The fluid is heterogeneously influenced by magmatic gas. The composition of fluid feeding the Kitagawa fumarolic gases is significantly affected by the magmatic gas, and the3He/40Ar* variation due to the changes in magma vesicularity is detectable. The fluid compositions feeding the Sesshogawara fumarole and the Manza fumarole are also affected by the magmatic gas, but not sensitive to the temporal variations of magmatic gas composition. We measured the concentrations and isotopic compositions of noble gases and CO2in fumarolic gases collected repeatedly at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano between October 2014 and April 2021. The variations in air-corrected3He/4He ratios suggest that the magmatic gas supply increased a few months after the phreatic eruption at Mt. Motoshirane in January 2018, then decreased between October 2018 and August 2019, and then increased again after October 2019. The relationship between the3He/CO2ratios and δ13C-CO2values also supports the temporal variations in magmatic gas contribution. Significant increases in3He/40Ar* ratios were detected in the periods of large magmatic gas supply. The increase probably reflects enhancement in the magma vesicularity. The detection of the3He/40Ar* variation strongly supports that the3He/40Ar* ratio is useful to monitor the current state of degassing magma, which is essential for understanding the deep process of volcanic unrest and may contribute to identifying precursors of a future eruption. Since fumaroles are commonly observed at active volcanoes, the monitoring of a magmatic–hydrothermal system by noble gas and carbon isotopic compositions of fumarolic gases should be applicable to other volcanoes. Fumarolic gas samples were collected at six sites at the Kusatsu-Shirane volcano (Fig.1). Three sites (W, C, E) are in the Kitagawa geothermal area located on the northern side of Mt. Shirane. The locations of W, C, E, Sesshogawara (S), and Manza (M) are the same as those of W, C, E, S, and M in ref.28, respectively. The temperatures of fumarolic gases were almost at the boiling points of water at the elevations of the sampling sites during the sampling period, except for the Motoshirane fumarolic gas. The temperature of the Motoshirane fumarolic gas was almost the same as the ambient temperature, and the gas was not accompanied by wet steam. In most cases, the gas samples were collected in 50 ml glass sample containers with vacuum valves at both ends. The fumarolic gas was introduced into the container from a fumarolic vent using a titanium pipe and Tygon tubes through a 100 ml glass bottle with vacuum valves at both ends. The 100 ml glass bottle was cooled in ice water to condense the water vapor of the fumarolic gas. The “dry” gas sample from which water vapor was almost completely removed by condensation was collected after flushing the sample container several times with fumarolic gas. The pH values of the condensed water were lower than 4.4 for all samples, indicating that CO2dissolution into the condensed water was negligible. Therefore, the δ13C values of CO2in the “dry” gas samples were assumed to be the same as those in the fumarolic gases. Some samples were collected in 120 ml Giggenbach-type glass bottles containing 5 molar 20 ml KOH solution, following the method described in ref.28. Since water and acidic gases are adsorbed into the KOH solution, noble gases reside in the headspace of the bottle as a residual gas (R-gas). The samples collected in the Giggenbach-type bottles are tagged as “yes” in the R-gas column of Supplementary TableS1. Noble gas analysis was carried out using a noble gas mass spectrometer (modified VG5400/MS-IV) at the University of Tokyo. Details on the mass spectrometric system and basic analytical procedure are the same as those described in refs.49,50. Air standards were frequently measured during the analysis to determine the mass discrimination factors and the sensitivities of the mass spectrometers for all noble gases except for helium isotopic ratios. The correction factor for the helium isotopic ratios was determined using an interlaboratory helium standard named HESJ. The recommended3He/4He ratio of HESJ is 20.63 ± 0.10 RA51. The errors in the noble gas isotopic ratios are 1 SD, including statistical errors during sample analysis, errors in the discrimination factors, and the error in the He standard gas. Uncertainties of the concentrations are assumed to be 5% for He, Ne, and Ar and 10% for Kr and Xe, based on the reproducibility of standard gas measurements. After noble gas analysis, the13C/12C ratios (expressed as δ13CPDBvalues) and concentrations of CO2in the gas samples were measured using a gas chromatography, combustion and mass spectrometry (GC/C/MS) system (Delta-S, Finnigan MAT instrument) at the University of Tokyo. The mass discrimination for δ13C and the sensitivity for CO2of the GC/C/MS system were calibrated by standard gas measurements (CO2> 99.95%, δ13C =  − 30.90‰), which were intermittently carried out during sample analysis. Uncertainties of the CO2concentrations and the δ13C-CO2values are assumed to be 10% and 0.3‰, respectively, based on the reproducibility of standard gas measurements. The (3He/4He)corrratios (air-corrected3He/4He) are calculated by the following equations assuming that the4He/20Ne ratios of magmatic and crustal components are significantly higher than that of air52: where (4He/20Ne)airof 0.318 is assumed3. The fractions of3Heairin the samples are calculated by the following equation assuming that all20Ne is derived from the air: The concentration of excess40Ar (=40Ar*) is given by: where (40Ar/36Ar)atmis the40Ar/36Ar ratio of atmospheric Ar in a sample. The (40Ar/36Ar)atmratio is given by: where 3031 and − 273.8 are the slope and intercept of the mass fractionation line for atmospheric Ar, respectively. The mass fractionation line is calculated assuming the Rayleigh process and the air Ar values of (38Ar/36Ar,40Ar/36Ar) = (0.188, 296)3. Since growing bubbles in a silicate melt quickly reach and maintain chemical equilibrium with the surrounding liquid, nonequilibrium exsolution might be due only to dramatic depressurization occurring during explosive volcanic activity18. Therefore, the3He/40Ar* variations were not likely to be produced by kinetic fractionation caused by the difference in He and Ar diffusivities. The noble gases in a gas phase exsolved from a silicate melt are fractionated as functions of solubilities and melt vesicularity45: where (Ci/Cj)gasis the abundance ratio of speciesiandjin the gas phase, (Ci/Cj)0is the initial abundance ratio in the melt,V*is the vesicularity of the melt of densityρ, SiandSjare the solubilities,Teis the equilibrium temperature, andT0is 273 K. According to Eq.6, noble gases with lower solubilities are preferentially partitioned into the gas phase, and the degree of fractionation decreases with increasing vesicularity. The solubility of Ar in a silicate melt is lower than that of He by a factor of 6–11 (ref.35). Therefore, the increases in3He/40Ar* ratios are attributable to the increased vesicularity of degassing magma. The fractionation of He/Ar in a gas phase of basaltic magma is computed by using Eq.6with assumptions that the solubilities for He and Ar are 5.7 × 10−4cm3STP g−1bar−1and 6.4 × 10−5cm3STP g−1bar−1(alkali olivine basalt at 1350°C35), respectively,ρis 2.8 g cm−3, and TCis 1350 °C (Fig.6a). Since the solubility of Ar is ~ 10 times lower than that of He, the He/Ar ratio in the gas phase can vary by a factor of ~ 10 at a maximum. Similarly, the fractionation of He/CO2is also computed by assuming a CO2solubility of 2.9 × 10−4cm3STP g−1bar−1(0.567 ppm bar−1in anhydrous silicate melts, ref.36) (Fig.6b).

A team at the University of Tokyo has found that the ratio of atoms in specific gases released from volcanic fumaroles (gaps in the Earth’s surface) can provide an indicator of what is happening to the magma deep below — similar to taking a blood test to check your health. This can indicate when things might be “heating up.” Specifically, changes in the ratio of argon-40 and helium-3 can indicate how frothy the magma is, which signals the risk of different types of eruption. Understanding which ratios of which gases indicate a certain type of magma activity is a big step. Next, the team hopes to develop portable equipment which can provide on-site, real-time measurements for a 24/7 volcanic activity monitoring and early warning system.
Does the thought of standing on a volcano make you quiver with excitement, or fear? For many people, living in the shadow of a volcano is part of daily life. Japan has 111 active volcanoes and an average of 15 volcanic “events,” including eruptions, every year. But these events are notoriously difficult to predict and can be deadly. In 2014, Mount Ontake, Japan’s second-highest volcano and a famous tourist spot, unexpectedly erupted, sadly killing 58 people and leaving five missing. Earthquake activity is typically an early warning sign, but some eruptions (including the one at Ontake) can occur without clear earthquake signals and so disaster mitigators, like the Japan Meteorological Agency, would benefit from other reliable ways to forewarn residents of the next potential disaster.
Fumaroles are holes and cracks in the Earth’s surface (the crust), which release gas and steam and often occur around volcanoes. The ejected gas is made up of a mix of chemicals. Its composition can provide us with insight into what is happening below the Earth’s crust in the mantle, where magma (molten rock) forms and pushes upwards, eventually erupting as lava. Researchers already know that the ratio of isotopes (atoms from an element with the same chemical properties but different mass) of certain gases can indicate hidden magma activity. “We knew that the helium isotope ratio occasionally changes from a low value, similar to the helium found in the Earth’s crust, to a high value, like that in the Earth’s mantle, when the activity of magma increases. This was based on an observation of the helium isotope ratio of cold spring gas in El Hierro Island, in the Canary Islands (in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwestern coast of Africa), where an eruption occurred in 2011,” explained Professor Hirochika Sumino from the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology. “But we didn’t know why we had more mantle-derived helium during magmatic unrest.”
To gain further insight, Sumino and team decided to monitor gases from six fumaroles around the active Kusatsu-Shirane volcano, which lies about 150 kilometers northwest of Tokyo in Gunma Prefecture. The team collected samples every few months for seven years between 2014 and 2021. After collection, they took the samples back to the lab and analyzed them using state-of-the-art equipment called a noble gas mass spectrometer. This enabled them to precisely measure isotopic compositions, including that of ultratrace (tiny but important) isotopes, such as helium-3, which is typically more abundant in the mantle compared to the crust or air.
“We succeeded in detecting changes in the magma-derived argon-40/helium-3 ratio, related to magmatic unrest. Using computer models, we revealed that the ratio reflects how much the magma underground is foaming, making bubbles of volcanic gases which separate from the liquid magma,” explained Sumino. “How much magma foams controls how much magmatic gas is provided to the hydrothermal system beneath a volcano and how buoyant the magma is. The former is related to a risk of phreatic eruption, in which an increase in water pressure in the hydrothermal system causes the eruption. The latter would increase the rate of magma ascent, resulting in a magmatic eruption.
“When you compare a volcano with a human body, the conventional geophysical methods represented by observations of earthquakes and crustal deformation are similar to listening to the chest and taking body size measurements. In these cases, it is difficult to know what health problem causes some noise in your chest or a sudden increase in your weight, without a detailed medical check. On the other hand, analyzing the chemical and isotope composition of elements in fumarolic gases is like a breath or blood test. This means we are looking at actual material directly derived from magma to know precisely what is going on with the magma.”
For now, gas samples have to be collected out in the field and brought back to the lab for analysis, which is a challenging and time-consuming process. However, Sumino has experience of improving noble gas mass spectrometers and hopes to develop a new tool which would enable them to perform the same analysis, but in real time and out in the field. “We want to be able to detect changes in magma activity as soon as possible,” said Sumino. “Now we are developing a portable mass spectrometer for on-site, real-time monitoring of noble gas isotope ratios from fumarolic gases. Our next step is to establish a noble gas analysis protocol with this new instrument, to make it a reality that all active volcanoes — at least those which have the potential to cause disaster to local residents — are monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.”

Here, we demonstrate an elaborate response of the yeast community against glucose depletion, in which the first adapted cells kill the latecomer cells. During glucose depletion, yeast cells release autotoxins, such as leucic acid and L-2keto-3methylvalerate, which can even kill the clonal cells of the ones producing them. Although these autotoxins were likely to induce mass suicide, some cells differentiated to adapt to the autotoxins without genetic changes. If nondifferentiated latecomers tried to invade the habitat, autotoxins damaged or killed the latecomers, but the differentiated cells could selectively survive. Phylogenetically distant fission and budding yeast shared this behavior using the same autotoxins, suggesting that latecomer killing may be the universal system of intercellular communication, which may be relevant to the evolutional transition from unicellular to multicellular organisms.

            wild-type When organisms face crises, such as starvation, they are forced to adapt at both individual [1,2] and population levels [3–5]. In unicellular organisms, the former has been intensively studied as an adaptation phenomenon [6–8], whereas the latter is poorly understood. Severe conditions decrease the carrying capacity [9], and unicellular organisms have to decrease the population size [10,11]. However, such an adjustment in cell number carries the risk of killing clonal cells. Thus, how cellular communities adapt to crises without decreasing the fitness of clonal cells remains unknown. Here, we report an elaborate survival behavior in crisis. When fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is cultured under glucose-limited conditions, where the carrying capacity is expected to decrease, cells release toxic molecules into the medium. Such a medium kills even the clonal cells of the toxin-producing cells when they are transferred from glucose-rich conditions. This may look like mass suicide at first glance. However, cells precultured in glucose-depleted conditions continue to grow even in the conditioned medium, as they adapt to the toxins through glucose depletion, and such cellular state is inherited. In other words, cells autonomously differentiate into 2 types, adapted and nonadapted ones, and the cellular community selectively saves the former. Yeast cells in glucose-depleted media release toxins, which prevent an invasion of latecomers by killing them, as the Greek philosopher argued: the plank of Carneades [12]. Surprisingly, the same behavior was observed in the budding yeast, which are phylogenetically distant relatives of the fission yeast [13]. We also demonstrate results implicating the underlying molecular mechanisms of the latecomer killing. To detect interactions in the population, we prepared conditioned media (CM) by culturing wild-type (WT) fission yeastS.pombereferred to as WT CM. First, cells were cultured for 30 h in the minimal media (MM) without glucose, with 3% glycerol as a carbon source (seeS1 Fig), and with 0.05% ethanol to induce genes to metabolize glycerol [14] (0% MM). Of note, we added 3% glycerol to every medium we used unless otherwise noted. Next, cells, which had been precultured in the MM with 3% glucose (3% MM), were cultured in the WT CM (see alsoFig 1Afor the procedure). Then, they stopped growing for approximately 20 h and resumed growing again (see the red line inFig 1B). We termed this prolonged lag phase as the delay phase (see Text A inS1 Textfor measurement of the delay phase). If incubation time to prepare CM was longer than 15 h, such media also induced the delay phase, while shorter incubation time did not introduce such a phase (Fig 1B). Although here we added leucine, adenine, uracil, and histidine to the MM as supplements for auxotroph mutant strains, the delay phase was induced regardless of whether we added these compounds or not (seeS2 Fig). It indicated that the delay phase was not caused by the amino acid–rich environment. Those results indicated that in the early growth phase, cells might release inhibitors for growth or depleted some of the nutrients required for such a phase.

Such a mutant strain could not grow without glucose (S3 Figand [14,16]) and was expected not to consume the nutrients required for growth. The CM made usingfbp1Δ cells (fbp1Δ CM) also caused the delay phase (Fig 1C), as shown with the WT CM. This suggested that the delay phase resulted from the release of inhibitory molecules by cells rather than the depletion of nutrients. In addition, when we administered glucose at a sufficient concentration to the CM (Fig 1D) to recover the carrying capacity, cellular growth was not disrupted, and the delay phase was not observed, i.e., the growth curve of cells in such media was almost the same as that of those in MM with glucose (Fig 1E). This indicated that inhibitory molecules in the CM worked only in the absence of glucose. When we added other species of sugars, i.e., fructose, galactose, and mannose, they were able to reduce the length of the delay phase, but each of them showed different strength of effect; fructose had the same effect as glucose, and galactose and mannose reduced the delay phase only partially (S4A Fig). Furthermore, if we administrated 2-deoxy-D-glucose, a glucose analog not metabolized by the glycolysis, cells did not grow. These results suggest that the rescue of the growth was due to the influence of each sugar on the metabolism, and not to signaling by glucose. Further, when glutamate or a mix of 12 amino acids commonly used as supplements for yeast was added to the CM, they did not rescue the growth (S4B Fig). After the delay phase, the growth rate in the CM returned to almost the same level as that in the glucose-depleted MM. This suggested that the cells were able to adapt to inhibitory molecules in the CM, and this adapted state was inherited; if cells do not memorize the adapted state, divided cells will not survive after the delay phase, and only a small portion of cells can escape death and grow. Then, the growth rate would decrease eventually. However, after the delay phase, the growth rate in the CM was stably maintained. Hence, those growing cells should inherit the adapted state from those mothers. To verify the existence of the adapted state of cells, we precultured cells in the 0% MM for 24 h and measured their growth in WT andfbp1Δ CM (Fig 1F), and a delay phase was not observed (Fig 1G). Furthermore, to verify whether adaptation to the inhibitory compounds was due to genetic or not, we precultured the cells, which survived in the CM, in 3% MM and, again, cultured them in the CM; they showed a delay phase again (S5 Fig). Moreover, we performed genomic DNA sequencing (gDNA-seq) of surviving cells and identified no unique single-nucleotide polymorphism or insertion–deletion mutations (InDels), except for highly repetitive sequence loci, such as telomeres and centromeres (seeS6 Figand Text B inS1 Textfor details). This indicated that the adapted state was inherited without genetic changes. The plausible evolutionary significance of the release of inhibitory molecules and adapting to them is the inhibition of the growth of different lineages of cells. When sugars around cells are depleted, they start to release inhibitory molecules while simultaneously adapting to such inhibitors. Then, the modified environment will inhibit the growth of latecomers, even if they are closely related. We performed a competition assay by artificially mimicking the above conditions; we simultaneously added cells that were precultured in glucose-rich and glucose-depleted media into the CM at an equal amount in the beginning and observed their population dynamics (S7 Fig). Then, the fraction of adapted cells to unadapted cells continued to increase for 24 h and reached a steady-state (Figs1HandS8A), while the 50–50 ratio was maintained in the competition assay between adapted cells (Figs1IandS8B). In addition, the steady-state ratio of adapted and unadapted cells agreed with the ratio predicted from the growth curve observed in fresh and CM shown inFig 1G(see also Text C inS1 Text). This implied that the combination of inhibitor release and adaptation caused population dynamics shown inFig 1H and 1Iand selected the offspring of inhibitor-producing cells to survive. The characteristics of the inhibitory molecules observed in the CM helped us isolate them. Since treatments of the CM with autoclaving, DNase, RNase, and proteases did not affect its ability to cause the growth delay (S9 Fig), the inhibitory molecules in the CM should not be peptides, proteins, or nucleic acids, as well as volatile/thermolabile materials. Then, we identified chemical compounds in the freshly prepared MM, as well as WT andfbp1Δ CM, using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS). We identified 20 chemical compounds (see Table A inS1 Text). From these candidates, we chose 12 chemicals that were included in both types of CM but not the fresh medium (see the yellow hatching region in the Venn diagram inFig 2A), because both types of CM initiated the delay phase. We further narrowed down 12 molecules by adding them as a single dose to the MM according to the following criteria: (1) They did not change the growth rate significantly after the delay phase. (2) They had little effect on growth in the presence of glucose. (3) They caused a shorter delay phase in cells that had already adapted to glucose depletion. Finally, we isolated 2 small molecules with similar structures: leucic acid (HICA;Fig 2B) and L-2keto-3methylvalerate (2K3MVA;Fig 2C). Note that some of the molecules in the candidate list were difficult to obtain commercially and could not be tested. (A) Venn diagram of compounds detected using CE-MS. Compounds in 0% MM, WT CM, andfbp1Δ CM were analysed. Twenty compounds were detected in both WT andfbp1Δ CM, and 8 of those were also detected in 0% MM.

When the concentration of these molecules was not sufficient, we did not observe the delay phase (Fig 2D and 2E). Then, the more inhibitors we administrated, the longer the delay phase took. Finally, if the concentration was higher than the critical concentrations (30 mM for HICA and 25 mM for 2K3MVA), cell growth was thoroughly repressed. Notably, there are 2 optical isomers of HICA, which are indistinguishable via CE-MS, both of which caused a growth delay at the same concentration (S10 Fig). When glucose was added to the MM simultaneously with inhibitory molecules, cell growth was not disrupted (see the orange line inFig 2F and 2G). Moreover, even under the administration of such high concentration where cells stopped growing, cells that had been adapted to glucose depletion grew (see blue line inFig 2F and 2G). These correspondences of inhibitory molecules with the CM implied that the release of HICA and 2K3MVA was one of the causes of growth inhibition during glucose depletion. Since adding leucine or the branched amino acids to the 0% MM did not cause the delay phase (S11 Fig), the growth inhibition was not due to ketogenic amino acids but to specific molecules we identified. Although the quantified concentrations of HICA and 2K3MVA in the CM were rather lower than the effective dose of each compound when only each was added to the medium (see Table B inS1 Textfor the concentrations of those in the CM), the addition of HICA and 2K3MVA to the CM drastically reduced the effective dose by approximately 3 orders of magnitude (seeFig 2H and 2I). The addition of HICA and 2K3MVA at the physiological concentration (50 to 100μM) to the WT CM led to drastic elongation of the delay phase, suggesting that HICA and 2K3MVA are indeed the important entities of the growth inhibitors that can work in a single dose, while they need other components for their full actions. It suggested that a combination of multiple secreted compounds might synergistically influence, while the main substances of growth inhibitors are HICA and 2K3MVA since other compounds detected did not cause the delay phase solely. The concentration of those molecules increased with time; from 10 to 20 h, they increased more than 5 times, and from 20 to 30 h, they increased more than 3 times. Accordingly, the delay phase appeared in the CM with a longer incubation time than 15 h (Fig 1B). It is consistent with the characteristics of the identified molecules, which repressed the cell growth above the critical concentrations (Fig 2D and 2E). In addition, since the cell doubling time in 0% MM was about 10 h (Table C inS1 Text), the concentrations of those molecules increased faster than cells, indicating that those molecules rapidly accumulated in the media. Note that the concentrations of identified growth inhibitors infbp1Δ CM were lower than those in WT CM, but those 2 CMs showed almost the same length of the delay phase (Table C inS1 Text). It implies that thefbp1Δ CM contains substantial amounts of cofactors for growth inhibitors that are not effective alone but can enhance the action of HICA and 2K3MVA. Even if such compounds exist, they will not be observed by the method we adopted here, and future studies will be necessary to identify them. We next explored the synthetic pathway of HICA and 2K3MVA. Although a synthetase for HICA (hydroxyisocaproic acid dehydrogenase) was identified in bacteria (see [17] forLactococcus lactis), neither its homolog nor any enzymes for HICA and 2K3MVA synthesis have been reported inS.pombe. We, therefore, searched for genes that encode hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, whose targets are unknown inS.pombe, by using UniProt [18], and made their disruptant mutants. Then, the concentrations of HICA and 2K3MVA in media conditioned by all of these strains decreased but did not reach zero (e.g., 5.3 to 10.6μM of HICA from 55.2 to 68.1μM in WT measured in the same condition; Table B inS1 Text). Correspondingly, these CM caused a shorter delay phase than that caused by the WT CM (seeS12 Fig). These results suggest thatS.pombesynthesized HICA and 2K3MVA by using multiple pathways and synthetases. More importantly, adding back 25 to 50μM of HICA or 2K3MVA, equivalent to their concentrations in the WT CM, to media conditioned by those mutants rescued the delay phase (seeS13 Fig). These results again support that HICA and 2K3MVA are real substances of growth inhibitors and unidentified minor compounds in CM promote the action of HICA and 2K3MVA. How do the inhibitory molecules cause the delay phase? There are 2 possible mechanisms: delay of initiation of growth in each cell or death of the majority of cells. In the latter, the concentration of living cells will be masked by that of dead cells in the optical density (OD) measurement, and an apparent delay phase will be observed until the concentration of living cells exceeds that of dead cells (see Text D inS1 TextandS14 Fig). To verify which hypothesis is correct, we counted the number of dead cells by staining them with phloxine B [19] (Fig 3A–3H). Then, over 80% of cells, which were cultured in the presence of a higher concentration of inhibitory molecules, were dyed in red (Fig 3G and 3H). Indeed, the majority of cells during the delay phase were stained red and showed a typical rod shape, as observed under a microscope, which showed the characteristics of dead cells [20,21] (Fig 3E and 3F). In contrast, only a small number of cells showed a spherical shape similar to cells cultured in MM without glucose. This indicated that only a small portion of the cells survived and continued to divide in the presence of inhibitory molecules. Similarly, the death rate in WT andfbp1Δ CM increased (Fig 3C, 3D and 3G). Furthermore, cells precultured under the glucose-depletion condition, which did not show a delay phase in the presence of the inhibitory molecules, were mostly alive (Fig 3H). This suggested that HICA and 2K3MVA induced cell death, which was the primary cause of the delay phase (see also Text D inS1 Text,S15andS16Figs and Table C inS1 Text).

CM, conditioned media; MM, minimal media; WT, wild-type. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001844.g003 We analyzed how cells were killed by the autotoxins or CM by costaining of annexin-V (AnnV) and propidium iodide (PI): Early apoptotic cells exhibit phosphatidylserine externalization and are stained by AnnV but not by PI. In contrast, primary necrotic cells show ruptured plasma membranes, which are stained by PI but not by AnnV [22]. Late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells are stained by both AnnV and PI. As a result, cells in the autotoxins and CM caused cell death via 2 processes, i.e., apoptosis and necrosis, as shown inS17 Fig. It suggests that the mechanism of cell death is not simple but multifarious, and there is no uniformity in the way how cell dies. In addition, we investigated what characterizes the tendency of death in the presence of autotoxins. One possibility is the difference in cell cycle stages. We thus measured the death rate of the temperature-sensitivecdc25-22mutant strain, whose cell cycle can be arrested at the G2 phase at higher temperatures [23,24]. Using thecdc25-22mutant, we prepared synchronously dividing cells and found that they showed higher death rates than asynchronously dividing cells, which will contain a substantial portion of cells arrested in the G0 phase. This suggests that the cell cycle stage is one of the major factors that determine the cell competency to survive or die, and the resting cells might show tolerance to autotoxins (S18 Fig). Note that the above mutant cells producing fewer autotoxins show the similar tolerance to the autotoxins with WT cells (S19 Fig). The identified toxins also facilitated cell adaptation in a condition-dependent manner. When we precultured cells in 3% MM with an inhibitory molecule, HICA or 2K3MVA, they grew in 0% MM with a sufficiently high concentration of inhibitory molecules that stopped the growth of nonadapted cells (Fig 3I and 3J). This indicated that the molecules we identified had 2 distinguishable effects: to kill latecomer cells and help firstcomer cells to adapt. Then, using RNAseq, we explored genes responsible for adaptation. We analyzed differentially expressed genes between 3% MM and 3% MM with 30 mM HICA or 25 mM 2K3MVA (S20 Fig). Gene ontology analysis revealed that many of the up-regulated genes in the adapted cells were involved in the transmembrane transport (exporters) and small molecule metabolic process (detoxification) (see Table D inS1 Text). We, therefore, constructed deletion mutants for 17 genes, which were included in the top 20 up-regulated genes in response to HICA (see Table E inS1 Textfor a list of up-regulated genes). They were precultured in 3% MM with 30 mM HICA for the adaptation to autotoxins, and their growth was measured in 0% MM with 30 mM HICA. Notably, we detected substantial delay of adaptation in many of the deletion mutants (Fig 3K). In particular, the growth of SPCC1739.08cΔ, SPBC1289.14Δ, SPBC359.06Δ, SPAC57A7.05Δ,ght4Δ,mfc1Δ, andmap1Δ strains was drastically suppressed, while that of those in 0% MM was normal (Figs3K,3LandS21). Those genes are predicted to encode a short-chain dehydrogenase, adducin, adducin, transmembrane transporter, plasma membrane hexose:proton symporter, prospore membrane copper transmembrane transporter, and DNA-binding transcription factor, respectively. These results suggest that cells undergo adaptation by the mechanisms of both evacuation and detoxification to autotoxins. Those genes were also up-regulated in the WT CM with glucose and might contribute to the rescue of the cell growth by sugars (S22 Fig). In addition, those genes were up-regulated in survived cells in the WT CM or in the presence of the autotoxins (S23 Fig). At the same time, the lack of those genes did not affect the growth in 0% MM (S24 Fig). These results suggest that the adaptation to glucose depletion and autotoxins depends on several different processes. Latecomer killing is not a unique characteristic ofS.pombebut is widely observed in unicellular fungi. We cultured 2 strains of budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, phylogenetically distant fromS.pombe, and prepared CM using them. Then, we found that such CM also initiated the delay phase in the growth of media producers (Figs4AandS25). Moreover, we detected the same toxic molecules, HICA and 2K3MVA, in the media conditioned withS.cerevisiae(see Table A inS1 Text). In addition, the administration of such toxins to MM without glucose initiated the delay phase in a concentration-dependent manner (Figs4B,4C,S14B and S14C). Indeed, we confirmed thatS.cerevisiaecells also died with the autotoxins similar toS.pombe(S26 Fig). Cells precultured under the glucose-depletion condition did not show a delay phase in their CM or 0% MM with an inhibitory molecule (Figs4D,4ES25D and S25E). This suggested that the same behavior with the same molecules, as observed inS.pombe, was evolutionarily conserved among distant species. In addition, media conditioned with distant species also initiated the delay phase (Fig 4F–4H), i.e., media conditioned withS.pombeinhibited the growth ofS.cerevisiaeand vice versa. Therefore, such a behavior was universally effective from closer to distant species. (A) Growth curves ofS.cerevisiae(OC-2) cells in media conditioned with themselves.

It seems similar to the toxin-antitoxin system, such as bacteriocins in bacteria [25,26] and killer factors in yeast [27,28] and paramecium [29], but it is fundamentally different. Although in the toxin-antitoxin system, the clonal cells are not killed [30], even the clonal latecomer cells can be killed when they have not been adapted to toxins in the mechanism discovered here. Such a behavior might help the yeast to avoid a mass suicide of the entire cell population and select an appropriate offspring that produces toxins and selfishly purify their genome from closely related species. Moreover, the latecomer killing may overcome the problems of the toxin-antitoxin system. In such a system, toxin producers should continuously produce antitoxins to protect themselves, and the maintenance of this state is a heavy burden for them [31]. Thus, the toxin producer is lost to a cheater, which only has the antitoxin system, whereas the cheater loses to cells with neither toxins nor immunity [32]. In contrast, the latecomer killing does not cost much because the adaptation system can be turned off without the toxin; indeed, the cells precultured in 3% MM without the autotoxins died in the CMs (Fig 1). In contrast, cheaters have disadvantages in their stable expression of protection mechanisms. Then, when the environment fluctuates between glucose-rich and glucose-depleted conditions like real natural conditions, cells with adaptation can beat cheaters in a glucose-rich situation, and cheaters would be expelled eventually. Thus, latecomer killing may be resistant to cheaters. We found that distant yeast species universally conserved latecomer killing, even at the molecular level. This might be because the toxins in the reported system are simple molecules, while toxins in the toxin-immunity systems in bacteria and yeast are highly evolved proteins. In the bacteriocin system ofEscherichia coli, toxins and receptors set off an arms race between the diversification of toxins and enhancement of their recognition by modifying the structure of proteins [33]. One of the reasons may be that the toxin-antitoxin system is vulnerable to the invasion of cheaters, as described above, and, therefore, the toxin-antitoxin system cannot be maintained without evolving various toxins. In contrast, in the latecomer killing, the targets of toxins are insensitive to the detailed structure of molecules and are not specific receptors. Indeed, the enantiomers of HICA have the same activity, where both D- and L-forms of HICA cause the delay phase at the same concentration (S10 Fig). Moreover, HICA was first identified from fermented products of a bacterium,Lactobacillus plantarum[34]. HICA is reportedly useful for human health and food production: HICA is toxic to various bacterial species and pathogenic biofilms produced byCandidaandAspergillusspecies [35]. It is also produced by various lactic acid bacteria during ripening of Korean pickles, kimchi. The above facts suggest that HICA and 2K3MVA targets are universally conserved pathways. Therefore, the toxins we found were effective against a range of cells, from clones to distant species. Furthermore, such universality at the molecular level is consistent with the hypothesis discussed above that latecomer killing is resistant to the invasion of cheaters. The latecomer killing we reported may play an important role in understanding the origin of multicellularity. Multicellular fungi fall into clades 8 to 11, while there are only 4 clades apart from fungi [36,37], indicating that transitions from unicellular to multicellular and multicellular to unicellular organisms occur easily in fungi. To form a complex multicellular body, mutual activation of growth, as well as growth inhibition and programmed cell death pathway, are essential [38]. Thus, the evolutionary origin or vestige of both mutual activation and inhibition of growth should be observed even in unicellular fungi. Indeed, multiple species of unicellular fungi use the former for quorum sensing [39]. However, the latter has not been reported. The mechanism we found here meets the criteria required for growth inhibition for multicellularity [40,41], i.e., the toxins cause cell death depending on the cell state and smoothly diffuse from cell to cell. The cell cycle dependency of cell death (S18 Fig) and the apoptotic pathway activation in a large fraction of dead cells (S17 Fig) may also suggest a possible relationship between latecomer killing and multicellularity. A recent artificial evolution experiment demonstrated that multicellular “snowflake” yeast repeatedly evolved 15 times from unicellularS.cerevisiaeand underwent apoptosis to keep the original size constant [42]. This suggests that the origin or vestige of multicellularity is embedded in the unicellular yeast. The relationship between intercellular communication in unicellular cells and multicellularity is key to solving the enigma of major transitions in evolution [43], and our study provides a significant milestone. Continuous measurement of the OD of yeast cultures was performed using ODBox-C/ODMonitor systems (Taitec, Saitama, Japan), a noncontact trubidimeter for shaking cultures. This apparatus detects and monitors the rate of transmitted light (950 nm) of shaken liquids in test tubes by voltage sensors every minute. ODBox-C was set in an incubator (BR-43FL, Taitec) and all the OD measurements were performed with 5 ml liquid cultures in 16.5 mm diameter test tubes at shaking speed of 180 rpm at 30° tilt angle. Following the manufacturer’s instruction, calibration for yeast culture was performed to convert the raw voltage data from ODMonitor into OD600OD at 600 nm (OD600was measured using iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). For growth measurement, each test tubes with media without cells were shaken for more than 30 min to stabilize the aeration effect, then yeast cells were added and OD was monitored. Detailed delay phase and death rate analyses are described in Texts A and D inS1 Text. Haploid strains, L972 (h−972) and AR110 (h−fbp1Δ), were used for theS.pombeexperiments. Wine yeast OC-2 (IAM4274) and baker’s yeast YEA8 were used for theS.cerevisiaeexperiments. Strain information is also listed in Table F inS1 Text. Initially, cells were precultured at 30°C in yeast extract with supplements (YES; 3% Glucose, 0.5% yeast extract, 200 mg/L Adenine, 100 mg/L Uracil, 200 mg/L Histidine, 200 mg/L Leucine) liquid media. Then, cells were transferred to liquid MM with 3% glycerol and 3% glucose and precultured at 30°C for about 24 h until OD600reached to 0.15 to 0.2 unless otherwise noted. The final concentration of MM was as follows: 14.7 mM potassium hydrogen phthalate, 15.5 mM Na2HPO4, 93.5 mM NH4CL, 0.05% EtOH, 5.2 mM MgCL2, 0.1 mM CaCl2·H2O, 13.4 mM KCl, 0.28 mM Na2SO4, 4.2μM pantothenic acid, 81.2μM nicotinic acid, 55.5μM inositol, 40.8 nM D-Biotin, 4.76μM citric acid, 8.09μM boric acid, 2.37μM MnSO4, 1.39μM ZnSPO47H2O, 0.74μM FeCl36H2O, 0.81μM (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.60μM potassium iodide, 0.16μM CuSO4·5H2O 200 mg/L adenine, 100 mg/L uracil, 200 mg/L histidine, 200 mg/L leucine. The culture was then inoculated into various media including MM with 3% glycerol without glucose (0% MM) and CM. Before cells were transferred, they were washed twice with the new media. Cells were precultured in 3% MM approximately to OD6000.1 to 0.2, and they are washed twice with 0% MM, transferred to the same volume of 0% MM, and incuvated for 30 h. The final OD600was around 0.4 to 1.0 after 30-h incubation forS.pombeCM of WT, gene deletion mutants in Figs3LandS12,S.cerevisiaeCM as they grew in 0% MM.fbp1Δ CM is also prepared at starting OD600approximately 0.1 to 0.2, but the final OD600is still 0.1 to 0.2 after 30-h incubation. Cells were pelleted down by brief centrifugation (at room temperature, 3,000 ·gfor 1 min). The supernatants were then filtered using a 0.22-μm PVDF membrane (Millex Sterile Filter Unit, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Cells were genetically tagged with mNeonGreen (HN98) or mCherry (HN101). Strain information is also listed in Table F inS1 Text. They were precultured in 3% or 0% MM and transferred to 0% MM and WT CM. mCherry and mNeonGreen fluorescence were detected at 561 nm and 488 nm and collected with 615/20 and 530/30 emission filters of NovoCyte flow cytometer (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. mNeonGreen-tagged strain was constructed from pFA6a-mNeonGreen-HIS3MX6, which was a gift from Wei-Lih Lee (Addgene plasmid #129100;http://n2t.net/addgene:129100; RRID:Addgene_129100) The gating strategy for competition assay is shown inS7 Fig. Media composition was measured using an Agilent Capillary Electrophoresis System (CE-MS), and data were processed by Human Metabolome Technologies (Turuoka, Japan) in anion and cation analysis modes according to a previously published method [44]. Peaks with signal/noise ratios of more than 3-fold were extracted using MasterHands software ver2.17.1.11 (Keio University, Turuoka, Japan), and HMT’s metabolite libraries were mined, including more than 900 metabolites to search for metabolites in the media. Capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-MS) was performed in 2 biological replicates for 0% MM, andfbp1Δ CM, and in 3 biological replicates for WT CM. We extracted compounds found in both samples (compounds found in only 1 sample are described as N.R. in Table A inS1 Text), and 12 candidates of growth inhibitors were identified following the criteria described in the main text. Every detected compound was added to freshly prepared 0% and 3% MM at a final concentration of 10 to 40 mM, which was sufficiently high to certainly identify the candidates that are effective with a single dose. Then, the growth rate of cells in such media was measured using ODBox-C/ODMonitor systems. Purified reagents of the detected compounds were purchased and used for the experiments. Their information is as follows: L-Leucic Acid (Cat#L0026, Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI), Tokyo, Japan; CAS RN: 13748-90-8), D-Leucic Acid (D—Hydroxyisocaproic acid; Cat#4026246, Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland; CAS RN: 20312-37-2), 3K2MVA (3-Methyl-2-oxovaleric Acid, Cat#K0020, TCI; CAS RN: 1460-34-0), 5-Oxoproline (DL-Pyroglutamic Acid; Cat#G0061, TCI; CAS RN: 149-87-1), 2-Hydroxyglutaric acid (Cat#H942575, Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Wako), Japan; CAS RN: 40951-21-1), Ala (L-Alanine; Cat#018–01043, Wako; CAS RN: 56-41-7), Gln (L(+)-Glutamine; Cat#076–00521, Wako; CAS RN: 56-85-9), Glu (L-Glutamic Acid; Cat#070–00502, Wako; CAS RN: 56-86-0), Glycerol 3-phosphate (Glycerophosphoric acid, aqueous solution 35% w/w; Cat#QA-1439, Combi-Blocks, San Diego, CA; CAS RN: 57-03-4), Hypoxanthine (Cat#H0311, TCI; CAS RN: 68-94-0), Inosine (Cat#099–00231, Wako; CAS RN: 58-63-9), Phe (L(-)-Phenylalanine; Cat#161–01302, Wako; CAS RN: 63-91-2), Succinic acid (Cat#190–04332, Wako; CAS RN: 110-15-6). The concentrations of HICA and 2K3MVA in various media were quantified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and data were processed by Chemicals Evaluation and Research Institute (CERI), Japan. Measurements were performed on a Shimadzu Nexera XR liquid chromatography coupled to a Sciex QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer with L-columun2 ODS Metal-free column (150 mm × 2.0 mm, 3 m; CERI). For gene expression analysis, 2 biological replicates were measured for each sample. As described above, 15 to 20 mL cultures 24 h after media change were prepared. Cells were pelleted down and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 250μL beads buffer (75 mM NH4OAc, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) at 65°C with 200μL acid-washed glass beads (Sigma), 25μL of 10% SDS, and 300μL of acid-phenol:chloroform (pH 4.5, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were vortexed 3 times 1 min each at 1-min intervals and incubated at 65°C, followed by a 10-min incubation at 65°C, 1-min vortexing, and 15-min centrifugation at room temperature (16,000 ×g). Then, the upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube with 200μL of beads buffer and 400μL of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, Sigma). Tubes were vortexed briefly and centrifuged at 4°C, 16,000 ×gfor 15 min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube with 600μL ice-cold isopropanol and 21μL 7.5 M NH4OAc. Tubes were vortexed briefly and centrifuged at 4°C, 16,000 ×gfor 30 min. After removing the supernatant, the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. RNA samples were treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega), followed by a ribosome RNA removal by the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal kit for yeast (Illumina). cDNA libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina paired-end technology on HiSeq (300-cycle). Two biological replicates were prepared for each sample. Salmon (version 1.1.0; [45]) was used to quantify RNA sequencing data. The reference genome and gene annotation list ofS.pombe(version 2017.10.31) on the PomBase database [46] were used. For differential expression analysis, the R package “DESeq2” was used [47]. Likelihood ratio tests were performed to compare cells in 3% MM versus cells in 3% MM with HICA or 2K3MVA. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed for 464 genes that were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated (p-value < 0.01) in both 3% MM with 30 mM HICA and that with 25 mM 2k3MVA compared to 3% MM using GO Term Finder [48]. Sequences were deposited in DDBJ with DRA BioProject Acession Number: PRJDB11860. RNA was purified as described above. For reverse transcription, PrimeScriptRT Reagent Kit with gDNA eraser (Takara Bio, Japan) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA libraries were quantified using StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the Thunderbird SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR primers used for qPCR are listed in Table G inS1 Text. Phloxine B (final concentration of 10μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) was used to dye dead cells. The fluorescent signal from phloxine B was detected at a wavelength of 488 nm and collected using 695/40 and 586/20 emission filters on a NovoCyte flow cytometer (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). The gating strategy for the identification of dead cell population is shown inS16 Fig. All images were captured using a microscope equipped with UPlanSApo 100×/1.40 Oil Objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) on an EVOS FL Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Images were acquired using a SonyICX285AL monochrome CCD camera controlled with built-in software for image acquisition. Fluorescence signal from phloxine B was detected at a wavelength of 530 nm and collected by EVOS Light Cube (Texas Red), which contains a 628/32 emission filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). AnnV/PI staining was performed using the ApoAlert Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Kit (Clontech) as previously described [49–51]. Approximately 1 × 107cells were first harvested and washed with Sorbitol buffer (1.2 M Sorbitol, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 35 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8), and then treated with 10 mg/ml Zymolyase-20T (Nacalai) for 2 h at room temperature. Spheroplasts were then washed and resuspended in 1 × Binding Buffer, followed by addition of 5μl of Annexin V-FITC and 10μl of PI according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 15-min incubation at room temperature in the dark, the samples were analyzed by a flow cytometry (NovoCyte) using a single laser emitting excitation light at 488 nm. Synchronous cultures were prepared by transient temperature shifts usingcdc25-22, temperature-sensitive mutant as previously reported [23,24,52]. Cells were precultured in 15.5 ml of 3% MM at 25°C for 24 h to 5 × 105cells/ml. Then, the cells were shifted to 36°C for 4.25 h followed by shifting the temperature to the permissive temperature of 25°C to release the G2 block. The cells were kept culturing at 25°C in the 3% MM for 0 h (G2 phase), 1 h (M/G1 phase), and 2 h (S phase), and 450μl of each culture were sampled for PI staining for cell synchronization analysis. Asynchronous cells were prepared without 36°C heat shock. The cells in the rest of the 15 ml cultures in each phase were dispensed into 3 aliquots, washed, and pelleted down followed by resuspension to 1 ml of 0% MM with 20, 22.5, or 25 mM HICA and 10μg/ml phloxine B. After 8 h from the media change, the dead cell ratio in each aliquot was measured by a flow cytometer as described above. Cells were fixed with 50μl formalin for 10 min on ice, washed twice in PBS, and treated with 0.2 mg/ml RNaseA in PBS/50mM EDTA for 2 h at 37°C. Then, PI was added to the final concentration of 5μg/μl, detected by a flow cytometer as described above. WT cells were cultured in WT CM for 24 h, and the culture was spread on YES agar plates to isolate single colonies. After incubating at 30°C for 3 days, 24 colonies were picked and cultured in YES liquid medium for 24 h and then in 3% MM for 24 h. Then, the cells were cultured in WT CM again, and their growth curves were constructed using ODBox-C/ODMonitor systems. WT cells were cultured in WT CM with phloxine B (final concentration of 10μg/ml) for 24 h. Unstained living cells were selected using a cell sorter SH-800 (SONY) using a 488-nm excitation wavelength laser with a 525/50 emission filter and 561 nm excitation wavelength laser with a 617/30 emission filter. Then, they were cultured in YES liquid medium at 30°C for 3 days and pelleted down to extract genomic DNA. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150μl of STES Buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 0.01 M EDTA, 1% SDS) with 150μl of glass beads and 150μl of phenol-chloroform. The samples were vortexed for 10 min, followed by a 10-min centrifugation at room temperature, 16,000 ×g. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube with 150μl of phenol-chloroform. The tubes were vortexed, followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 16,000 ×gat room temperature. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and mixed with 15μl of 3 M NaOAc and 375μl of ethanol. The samples were mixed briefly and centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature (16,000 ×g). After the supernatant was removed, the pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. Genomic DNA libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA libraries were sequenced using the Illumina paired-end technology on MiSeq with MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (600-cycle; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

PLOS is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation, #C2354500, based in San Francisco, California, US","Yeast is not the simple single-celled microorganism we once thought, but a competitive killer. When starved of glucose, yeast releases a toxin that will poison other microorganisms that have entered its surrounding habitat, even its own clones. This venomous phenomenon was previously unknown and contributes to our understanding of unicellular microorganism behavior, the evolution of unicellular to multicellular organisms, as well as having potentially useful applications for the food industry.
Bread baking became a popular new hobby during the pandemic, so nowadays you’ll probably find a small packet of dried yeast stashed away in many a kitchen cupboard. For thousands of years, this little living fungus has been a staple part of our diet, enabling us to enjoy fluffy bread, sweet wine and frothy beer. Until recently, yeast was thought to be a simple unicellular (single cell) microorganism, but researchers at the University of Tokyo have now discovered it has a murderous survival strategy.
“In the critical survival situation of glucose starvation, yeasts release toxins into their habitat which kill other microorganisms while the yeast itself acquires resistance,” explained Assistant Professor Tetsuhiro Hatakeyama from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. “We have called this phenomenon latecomer killing. We were even more surprised to find that the toxins produced by yeasts can also kill their nonadapted clones, so they are at risk of killing not only invading microorganisms but also their own offspring. Such seemingly risky and almost suicidal behavior had not previously been found in a single-celled organism or even considered to exist.”
Although cooperative forms of behavior are well known in many bacteria and fungi, this research is the first prominent finding of competitiveness occurring in clonal cells in unicellular organisms. This has important implications for our understanding of the ecology of microorganisms, as well as why some specific microorganisms grow during fermentation while others do not. To make this discovery, the team grew clonal cells (i.e., derived from the same parental cell) separately under glucose-limited and glucose-rich conditions. When the cells were combined, their growth patterns showed that yeast cells which had already adapted to glucose starvation were able to poison latecomers and keep food resources for themselves.
“Our research reveals a surprisingly selfish side to yeast behavior,” said Hatakeyama. “The phenomenon we discovered is similar to a thought experiment proposed by the ancient Greek philosopher Carneades of Cyrene, called the plank of Carneades: If a sailor escapes from a shipwreck by holding on to a plank that is capable of supporting barely one person, and then pushes away another sailor who comes after him, will he be charged with murder?” The researchers suggest that this strategy may help yeast avoid mass starvation of the population, while also aiding selection of toxin-producing offspring that are more likely to continue their lineage. The strategy was observed in several different types of yeast — initially taken from beer, bread and wine — which could mean that this phenomenon may occur more widely across this diverse species.
This discovery could be used to develop useful growth control mechanisms for economically important species of yeast, such as those used in the food industry. Although not included in this study, it may also pave the way to better controlling types of yeast which can negatively affect human and animal health. The team would next like to explore the implications of this discovery for cell evolution. “For the development of multicellular organisms, not only mutual activation of cellular growth but also mutual inhibition of cellular growth or programmed cell death in clonal cells is required,” explained Hatakeyama. “Fungi are known to tend to an evolutionary transition between unicellularity and multicellularity more readily than other organisms, so we would like to unravel the relationship between the latecomer killing and the evolution of multicellular organisms. We hope this research will make a significant contribution to our understanding of ecosystem development and evolutionary transitions.”

These systems have to be trained, often needing to learn to recognize objects from video or image data. This data often contains superfluous content that reduces the accuracy of models. So researchers found a way to incorporate natural hand gestures into the teaching process. This way, users can more easily teach machines about objects, and the machines can also learn more effectively.
You’ve probably heard the term machine learning before, but are you familiar with machine teaching? Machine learning is what happens behind the scenes when a computer uses input data to form models that can later be used to perform useful functions. But machine teaching is the somewhat less explored part of the process, of how the computer gets its input data to begin with. In the case of visual systems, for example ones that can recognize objects, people need to show objects to a computer so it can learn about them. But there are drawbacks to the ways this is typically done that researchers from the University of Tokyo’s Interactive Intelligent Systems Laboratory sought to improve.
“In a typical object training scenario, people can hold an object up to a camera and move it around so a computer can analyze it from all angles to build up a model,” said graduate student Zhongyi Zhou. “However, machines lack our evolved ability to isolate objects from their environments, so the models they make can inadvertently include unnecessary information from the backgrounds of the training images. This often means users must spend time refining the generated models, which can be a rather technical and time-consuming task. We thought there must be a better way of doing this that’s better for both users and computers, and with our new system, LookHere, I believe we have found it.”
Zhou, working with Associate Professor Koji Yatani, created LookHere to address two fundamental problems in machine teaching: firstly, the problem of teaching efficiency, aiming to minimize the users’ time, and required technical knowledge. And secondly, of learning efficiency — how to ensure better learning data for machines to create models from. LookHere achieves these by doing something novel and surprisingly intuitive. It incorporates the hand gestures of users into the way an image is processed before the machine incorporates it into its model, known as HuTics. For example, a user can point to or present an object to the camera in a way that emphasizes its significance compared to the other elements in the scene. This is exactly how people might show objects to each other. And by eliminating extraneous details, thanks to the added emphasis to what’s actually important in the image, the computer gains better input data for its models.
“The idea is quite straightforward, but the implementation was very challenging,” said Zhou. “Everyone is different and there is no standard set of hand gestures. So, we first collected 2,040 example videos of 170 people presenting objects to the camera into HuTics. These assets were annotated to mark what was part of the object and what parts of the image were just the person’s hands. LookHere was trained with HuTics, and when compared to other object recognition approaches, can better determine what parts of an incoming image should be used to build its models. To make sure it’s as accessible as possible, users can use their smartphones to work with LookHere and the actual processing is done on remote servers. We also released our source code and data set so that others can build upon it if they wish.”
Factoring in the reduced demand on users’ time that LookHere affords people, Zhou and Yatani found that it can build models up to 14 times faster than some existing systems. At present, LookHere deals with teaching machines about physical objects and it uses exclusively visual data for input. But in theory, the concept can be expanded to use other kinds of input data such as sound or scientific data. And models made from that data would benefit from similar improvements in accuracy too.
