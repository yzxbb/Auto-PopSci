2-billion-year-old rock home to living microbes,"Recent advances in subsurface microbiology have demonstrated the habitability of multi-million-year-old igneous rocks, despite the scarce energy supply from rock-water interactions. Given the minimal evolution coupled with exceedingly slow metabolic rates in subsurface ecosystems, spatiotemporally stable igneous rocks can sustain microbes over geological time scales. This study investigated a 2-billion-year-old mafic rock in the Bushveld Igneous Complex, South Africa, where ultradeep drilling is being executed by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). New procedures were successfully developed to simultaneously detect indigenous and contaminant microbial cells in a drill core sample. Precision rock sectioning coupled with infrared, fluorescence, and electron microscopy imaging of the rock section with submicron resolution revealed microbial colonization in veins filled with clay minerals. The entry and exit of microbial cells in the veins are severely limited by tight packing with clay minerals, the formation of which supplies energy sources for long-term habitability. Further microbiological characterization of drilled rock cores from the Bushveld Igneous Complex will expand the understanding of microbial evolution in deep igneous rocks over 2 billion years.

The terrestrial subsurface is defined by depths greater than 8 m from the ground surface, excluding soil [1], where a significant portion of the Earth’s prokaryotic biomass resides [2,3,4]. The metabolic activities of subsurface microbiomes are exceedingly slow under survival mode [5,6], leading to an estimated turnover time ranging from several thousand to million years. Consistent with the long turnover time [7], sulfate-reducing bacteriaCandidatusDesulforudis audaxviator endemic to the deep subsurface have undergone minimal evolution since 55–165 million years ago [8]. Similarly, minimal evolution over geological time scales has been demonstrated for deep subsurface archaeal lineages calledCandidatusAltiarchaeota [9]. Based on the ecological and evolutionary features of subsurface microbiomes, it is hypothesized that microbes can be sustained with minimal evolution for billions of years in a geologically and tectonically stable subsurface environment [10]. The basement of the oceanic and continental crust is dominated by igneous rocks. Microbiological studies of the igneous basement have been intensively studied by sampling fluids from drilled boreholes [11]. In cases where collecting pristine fluid samples was technically difficult or impossible, drilled rock cores were used for microbiological characterization. For example, in the Oman ophiolite complex, ~ 100-million-year-old (Ma) mantle peridotite was drilled by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). To examine contamination, fluorescent microspheres were added to the drilling fluid and counted in the crushed and homogenized drill core samples [12]. Cells were separated from rock particles, and then DNA-stained cells with SYBR Green I were counted by flow cytometry [13]. The cell density was up to six orders of magnitude higher at fractures and veins (~ 107cells/g) than in the rock matrix (~ 101–2cells/g) [12]. In another example, 100-million-year-old basaltic oceanic crust was drilled by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) in the South Pacific Gyre, using fluorescent microspheres in the drilling fluid for contamination control [14,15]. In addition to contamination control using fluorescent microspheres and microbial cells extracted from the bulk rocks with ultra-low cell abundances, new visualization approaches were successfully developed to enumerate microbial cell densities at fractures and veins that exceeded 1010cells/cm3[14,15]. This contribution extends the formation age of igneous rocks for microbiological investigations by targeting mafic and ultramafic rocks formed 2.05 billion years ago in the Bushveld Igneous Complex of northeastern South Africa, which is the largest mafic–ultramafic layered intrusion on Earth [16,17]. The Bushveld Drilling Project of the ICDP is undertaking a 2.5-km-deep drill hole in the lower zone and base of the intrusion, where ultramafic rocks are expected to possess the chemical signature of the mantle endmember of mantle-crust mixing during magma emplacement [18,19]. Following comparatively rapid cooling of the magma chamber [20], the layered rocks have experienced minimal deformation and metamorphic alteration, based on general geological features such as the very minor occurrence of metamorphic rocks and the nearly horizontal dip [21]. Thus, the Bushveld Igneous Complex is considered to provide a stable habitat for microbial life for > 2 billion years. Additionally, the Bushveld Igneous Complex is hosted in the Kaapvaal Craton where the devoid of significant modern tectonic activity might help the long-term preservation of fluids and habitable environments [22,23, and references therein]. The long-term habitability of subsurface microbes has been studied in Precambrian cratons in Canada and South Africa where fluids and habitable environments have been preserved on a range of timescales from thousands to millions, to even billions of years [22,23, and references therein]. In the previous studies, fracture waters were obtained from deep underground tunnels constructed at mines. In this study, the habitability of 2.05-billion-year-old igneous rocks was investigated through drilling from the ground surface rather than underground sampling of fracture waters. Alternatively, rock sampling is feasible at surface outcrops. However, the freshness of rocks is concerned, given that the rocks have experienced weathering. This paper reports on the first subsurface rock sample obtained from the ICDP drilling used to test new approaches for the simultaneous visualization of microbial cells and fluorescent microspheres at fractures and veins. A new spectroscopic method was also applied to obtain diagnostic spectra from single microbial cells [24]. As a result, indigenous microbial cells locally distributed along clay-filled veins were detected. The Bushveld Igneous Complex is the largest mafic–ultramafic intrusion on Earth, with an areal extent of ~ 500 km in the east–west direction and 350 km north–south [21]. The magmas of the Bushveld Igneous Complex were emplaced in the early Proterozoic Pretoria Group of the Transvaal Supergroup 2.05 billion years ago [16]. The entire intrusion took place in a time span of 1 million years [19]. The Bushveld ICDP drilling site is located at Marula Mine in Burgersfort (− 24.50906°S, 30.08757°E), where the UG2 chromitite layer of the Upper Critical Zone is being exploited for the extraction of platinum group elements. Rotary core barrel (RCB) drilling was conducted by Master Drilling with a diamond drill bit and drilling fluid composed of locally sourced water mixed with a chemical additive (AMC CAP 21). Fluorescent microspheres called “Invisible Blue” (DayGlo Color Corp., pigment SPL-594NXC) with blue fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) excitation and a particle size range from 0.25 to 0.45 μm [25] were added to the drilling fluid. The original particle concentration of ∼1 × 1012particles/ml was diluted to a concentration of ~ 1 × 109particles/ml. A 30-cm-long core sample with a diameter of 85 mm at a depth of 15.28 (sample ID: 5067_3_A_010_2_WR:29-57) was obtained on May 4th, 2024. After the core retrieval, the sample was laid on aluminum foil in a core box for the initial photography. The core sample was washed with drinking water filtered through 0.2-µm-size pores (Fig.1). Although membrane vesicles and nanobacteria can pass through the filter, the cell densities measured after the passage through 0.1- and 0.2-µm-size pores were not different. The surface was lightly flamed with a gas torch on a flame-sterilized metal tray to reduce contamination, following a procedure used in the IODP expeditions [15,26]. After the cleaning steps, rock fractures were opened by hitting the core sample with a flame-sterilized hammer, and the rock fragments were stored at 4 °C in sterilized plastic bags, and then placed in vacuum-sealed plastic bags containing oxygen absorbent (Mitsubishi Chemicals Corp.). On-site handling of a drill core. A schematic illustration of the workflow for cleaning, flaming, and storing of a rock core sample The rock core fragments were illuminated by a 5-W UV light (Nichia Kagaku, Japan), and blue fluorescence was observed in a darkened room. After visual inspection, the rock fragment was cut using a precision diamond band saw operated without water (Meiwa Fosis Corp. DWS 3500P, Japan) in a clean booth flushed with HEPA-filtered air. A 3-mm-thick section was prepared by cutting the sample perpendicular to the fracture. Fluorescence microspheres that permeated from the fracture into the rock interior were observed by a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus, Japan) with a CCD camera (Olympus DP71, Olympus, Japan) and the image processing software LuminaVision (Mitani Shoji Co., Ltd.). For the drilling fluid, a fluid sample was fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and then diluted with 10 ml filter-sterilized deionized water. After ultrasonic treatment for 30 s, a 0.2-µm-pore-size, 25-mm-diameter polycarbonate filter (Millipore) was used to collect dispersed particles. The filter was observed using the same fluorescence microscope system. The 3-mm-thick rock section was analyzed by optical-photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of 0.5 µm (mIRage infrared microscope, Photothermal Spectroscopy Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) using a continuous wave 532-nm laser as the probe beam. A pump beam consisting of a tunable quantum cascade laser (QCL) device (800–1800 cm−1; 2 cm−1spectral resolution; and 10 scans per spectrum) was also used. The refection mode (Cassegrain 40 objective (0.78 NA)) was used to obtain intensity maps at 1000, 1530, and 1640 cm−1as well as O-PTIR spectra over the mid-IR range. Co-cultured cells of Nanoarchaeota strain MJ1 andMetallosphaerasp. strain MJ1HA (JCM33617) and cultured cells ofShewanella oneidensis(ATCC 700550) were mounted on CaF2disks to obtain O-PTIR spectra. The Clay Science Society of Japan (JCSS) reference clay samples montmorillonite JCSS3101 ((M +0.97)[Si7.8Al.02][Al3.3Fe-0.2Mg.6]O20(OH)4)) and saponite JCSS3501 ((M +0.98)[Si7.2Al.08][Mg6.0]O20(OH)4)) and a reference sample of nontronite coded NAu-2 ((M +0.97)[Si7.57Al.01Fe.42][Al.52Fe3.32Mg.7]O20(OH)4[27] were also mounted on CaF2disks to obtain O-PTIR spectra. The drilling fluid sample was treated similarly to the rock to observe fluorescent microspheres, except for the incubation of the filter in a TAE buffer containing SYBR Green I for 5 min at room temperature. This step was followed by a brief rinsing with deionized water. After O-PTIR spectroscopic analysis, the 3-mm-thick section was fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight and stored at 4 °C in PBS. The fixed section was stained with SYBR Green I (Takara-Bio, Inc., Japan) for 30 min. After washing with ultrapure water, the section was observed using the same fluorescence microscopy system. The thin section was characterized by SEM without polishing. A field-emission-type SEM (FEI Versa 3D™) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) with a silicon drift detector (Bruker) was operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. This study sampled a drill core sample from ~ 15-m depth and a corresponding drilling fluid sample from the tank where fluorescent microspheres were added and mixed. Microscopic observations of fluorescent microspheres in the fluid sample confirmed that the concentration of fluorescent microspheres (1.1 × 109particles/ml) is consistent with dilution with water in the tank (Fig.2A). In the same drilling fluid sample, DNA-stained microbial cells with a size range from ~ 1 to ~ 5 µm were abundant (7.0 × 107cells/ml; Fig.2B). Thus, there is a concern that permeation of the drilling fluid into the interior of rock cores could cause microbial contamination. Microscopic inspection of the drill fluid sample.A1000-fold magnification images of fluorescent microspheres and (B) microbial cells stained by SYBR Green I The drill core sample consists of norite (mafic rock with dominant plagioclase and orthopyroxene) with a porphyritic texture (Fig.3A). After the mineral-filled fractures were opened (Fig.3B; a yellow arrow indicates the fracture shown in Fig.3C,E, andFand Fig.4A), a ~ 10-cm-long fragment was inspected for the occurrence of fluorescent microspheres by illuminating the core exterior and the fracture surface by UV light (Fig.3C–F). Strong blue signals from fluorescent microspheres were noticed from the core exterior (Fig.3D), whereas the blue signals were not evident at the entire fracture surface. These results demonstrate that the microspheres did not penetrate the mineral-filled fracture. Appearance of the studied drill core sample and visual inspection of drilling fluid contamination.

The intensity maps were obtained from the area highlighted with a yellow square inB.GRGB color synthesis of the three intensity maps. A yellow rectangle inGindicates an area where the intensity maps for RGB color synthesis are obtained in Fig. 5A To visualize the distribution of fluorescent microspheres from the fracture surface to the rock interior, a 3-mm-thick section was examined (Fig.4A; a yellow arrow indicates the fracture surface shown in Fig.3E andF). Microscopic observations revealed that fluorescent microspheres were not detected from the surface to the interior of the section (Fig.4B andC). These results also demonstrated that in addition to the rock surface, the rock interior was not contaminated by the drilling fluid. This new approach for contamination evaluation was successfully developed for the BVDP project. Before staining in SYBR Green I solution, which causes organic contamination, the detection of microbial cells was performed by a nondestructive technique called O-PTIR spectroscopy (Fig.4D–G). Three wave numbers were selected for intensity mapping, whereby 1000 cm−1and the combination of 1530 and 1640 cm−1indicate the presence of silicate minerals and microbial cells, respectively [28,29]. Mapping of a 2 × 2 mm area revealed veins nearly parallel to the fracture with high intensities at 1530 and 1640 cm−1(Fig.4E andF), whereas the ubiquity of silicate minerals was shown by the 1000 cm−1map (Fig.4D). From one of the vein-like regions (400 × 250 μm shown as a yellow rectangle in Fig.4G), RGB mapping was performed to resolve the intensity distributions of 1000, 1530, and 1640 cm−1(Fig. 5A). Although the 1640 cm−1intensity was strong throughout the vein region, the high intensity at 1530 cm−1appeared spotty and partly overlapped with the high intensity of 1000 cm−1(shown in white color in Fig. 5A). Mapping of white spots at the finer resolution showed a micrometer-scale heterogeneity (Fig. 5B). In Fig.4C, O-PTIR spectra obtained from the vein-like region represented by point 1 (Fig. 5B) had two major peaks attributed to SiO2(~ 1000 cm−1) and H2O (~ 1640 cm−1). The overall spectra are similar to those of smectite minerals commonly formed by low-temperature alteration of mafic and ultramafic rocks [14,30]. Several O-PTIR spectra from the white spots contained two peaks of ~ 1530 and ~ 1640 cm−1attributed to amides I and II, which are diagnostic for proteins in microbial cells (points 5 and 6 in Fig.5C). The rest of the peaks in the O-PTIR spectra are similar to those obtained from adjacent points (points 3 and 4) and a distant point (point 2), suggesting the coexistence of some mineral phases with microbial cells.

Fluorescent microscopic observations showed that greenish signals were obtained from the veins indicated by pink arrows in Fig.6A. High-magnification observations of the white spots revealed that the greenish signals were morphologically similar to microbial cells with a size range of less than 1 μm (Fig.6B). Taking the amide peaks in the O-PTIR spectra into account, we conclude that the veins are colonized by microbes. In addition, the morphological difference in microbial cells from the vein and the drilling fluid (Fig.2B) indicates that the microbial cells found in the vein are indigenous rather than originating from contamination.

Pink arrows inApoint to the veins shown in Fig.4 After the DNA-stained microbial cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy, the section was analyzed by SEM–EDS to determine the vein-fill mineralogy (Fig.7). From a region associated with microbial cells in the vein (Fig.7A), Si, O, and Mg were detected as major elements (Fig.7B). A ratio of peak intensities of Si and Mg was ∼2:1, suggesting that the vein is filled with a 2:1 tri-octahedral clay mineral. The presence of water molecules in the O-PTIR spectrum (point 1 in Fig. 5C) and the low intensity of interlayer Ca in the EDS spectrum (Fig.7B) are consistent with the occurrence of saponite [14]. However, the co-occurrence of several clay minerals in the analyzed region was not excluded due to the spatial resolution of SEM–EDS analysis. Thus, high-resolution mineralogical analysis is needed to identify the mineral phases. Mineralogical characteristics of the vein associated with microbial colonization.AA back-scattered electron image of the area in the section, where microbial colonization is shown in Fig.6B.BAn EDS spectrum from the pink circle inA For microbiological investigations of igneous rocks in the subsurface, the use of fluorescent microspheres started in terrestrial drilling [31] and was later adopted for ocean drilling [32]. A common procedure for detecting fluorescent microspheres is to crush the rock core material into powder [26]. Fluorescent microspheres are extracted from the powdered material by suspending the sample in a 3% NaCl solution and collecting fluorescent microspheres from the supernatant. This procedure cannot distinguish the exact location of fluorescent microspheres or the proportion of microspheres in fractures/veins and in the rock matrix. The direct observation of fluorescent microspheres developed in this study enables the location-specific detection of fluorescent microspheres in fractures/veins. The new microbial detection approach also differs from previous approaches, in which rock fragments were embedded in hydrophilic resin to prepare thin sections [14,15]. Although the resin can preserve rock features found in the void space [33], fluorescent microspheres are removed during dehydration of the fragments with ethanol and subsequent resin embedding. Dry cutting with a diamond band saw has technical advantages in avoiding analytical interferences for organic compounds. In the previous approaches, staining of microbial cells with SYBR Green I was performed using a ~ 100-μm-thick section [14,15,33]. To verify the greenish signals of SYBR Green I–stained microbial cells or materials strongly adsorbing SYBR Green I [34], 3-μm-thick sections were prepared by focused ion beam (FIB). Subsequent nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) measurements were performed to show the co-localization of ions, such as32S−,31P−, and12C14N−[14,30]. The FIB section fabrication for NanoSIMS analysis was limited to very small areas (~ 10 × 10 μm), whereas mapping at the millimeter scale down to the tens of micrometer scale can be performed by O-PTIR spectroscopy. In ~ 100-Ma igneous rocks obtained from drill cores from the ICDP Oman ophiolite drilling and from IODP Expedition 329 to the South Pacific Gyre, microbial colonization was found to be associated with fractures and veins [12,14,15]. In the IODP basaltic basement study, the association of microbial cells and clay minerals was clearly demonstrated [14,15]. Clay minerals can effectively adsorb organic matter [35] and organic matter is also produced on clay minerals in situ [36]. Furthermore, it is known that H2is derived from H2O reacted with Fe(II) in the transformation of silicate minerals into clay minerals [37]. In the case of the 2-billion-year-old mafic rock investigated in this study, veins with microbial colonization are associated with clay minerals. The tight sealing of the veins with clay minerals prevented the contamination of microbial cells from the drilling fluid. In turn, indigenous microbes are immobile and survive in the veins by metabolizing inorganic and/or organic energy available around clay minerals. The age of vein formation and clay mineralization needs to be determined for the duration of habitability. Combining previously developed procedures using fluorescent microspheres and SYBR Green I for contamination control and microbial detection, respectively, this study successfully developed new procedures for the detection of microbial colonization in fractures/veins in drill cores of igneous rocks, involving precision sectioning by a diamond band saw and single-cell level detection by IR spectroscopy. Application of the new procedures to a 2-billion-year-old mafic rock from the Bushveld Igneous Complex revealed that indigenous microbes are colonizing veins filled with clay minerals. Future studies are directed to clarify the phylogenomic and metabolic profiles of the microbiome and the formation history of fractures/veins in the rock interior. No datasets were generated or analysed during the current study. Whitman WB, Coleman DC, Wiebe WJ (1998) Prokaryotes: the unseen majority.

The rock was excavated from the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, an area known for its rich ore deposits. This is the oldest example of living microbes being found within ancient rock so far discovered. The team involved in the study built on its previous work to perfect a technique involving three types of imaging – infrared spectroscopy, electron microscopy and fluorescent microscopy – to confirm that the microbes were indigenous to the ancient core sample and not caused by contamination during the retrieval and study process. Research on these microbes could help us better understand the very early evolution of life, as well as the search for extraterrestrial life in similarly aged rock samples brought back from Mars.
Deep in the earth lies something ancient and alive. Colonies of microbes live in rocks far beneath the surface, somehow managing to survive for thousands, even millions of years. These tiny, resilient organisms appear to live life at a slower pace, scarcely evolving over geological time spans and so offering us a chance to peek back in time. Now, researchers have found living microbes in a rock sample dated to be 2 billion years old.
“We didn’t know if 2-billion-year-old rocks were habitable. Until now, the oldest geological layer in which living microorganisms had been found was a 100-million-year-old deposit beneath the ocean floor, so this is a very exciting discovery. By studying the DNA and genomes of microbes like these, we may be able to understand the evolution of very early life on Earth,” said Yohey Suzuki, lead author and associate professor from the Graduate School of Science at the University of Tokyo.
The rock sample was taken from the Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC), a rocky intrusion in northeastern South Africa which formed when magma slowly cooled below the Earth’s surface. The BIC covers an area of approximately 66,000 square kilometers (roughly the size of Ireland), varies in thickness by up to 9 km, and contains some of the richest ore deposits on Earth including about 70% of the world’s mined platinum.
Due to the way it was formed and minimal deformation or change occurring to it since then, the BIC is believed to have provided a stable habitat for ancient microbial life to continue until today.
With the aid of the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program, a nonprofit organization that funds exploration at geological sites, the team obtained a 30-centimeter-long rock core sample from about 15 meters belowground. The rock was cut into thin slices and analyzed, which is when the team discovered living microbial cells densely packed into cracks in the rock. Any gaps near these cracks were clogged with clay, making it impossible for the organisms to leave or for other things to enter.
The team built on a technique theyhad previously developedto confirm that the microbes were native to the rock sample, and not due to contamination during the drilling or examination process. By staining the DNA of the microbial cells and using infrared spectroscopy to look at the proteins in the microbes and surrounding clay, the researchers could confirm that the microorganisms were both alive and not contaminated.
“I am very interested in the existence of subsurface microbes not only on Earth, but also the potential to find them on other planets,” said Suzuki. “NASA’s Mars rover Perseverance is currently due to bring back rocks that are a similar age to those we used in this study. Finding microbial life in samples from Earth from 2 billion years ago and being able to accurately confirm their authenticity makes me excited for what we might be able to now find in samples from Mars.”

This is essential for the fundamental studies of physics as well as practical applications such as precision spectroscopy4,5,6,7, ultracold gases with quantum statistical properties8,9,10and quantum computing. In laser cooling, atoms are slowed to otherwise unattainable velocities through repeated cycles of laser photon absorption and spontaneous emission in random directions. Simple systems can serve as rigorous testing grounds for fundamental physics—one such case is the purely leptonic positronium11,12, an exotic atom comprising an electron and its antiparticle, the positron. Laser cooling of positronium, however, has hitherto remained unrealized. Here we demonstrate the one-dimensional laser cooling of positronium. An innovative laser system emitting a train of broadband pulses with successively increasing central frequencies was used to overcome major challenges posed by the short positronium lifetime and the effects of Doppler broadening and recoil. One-dimensional chirp cooling was used to cool a portion of the dilute positronium gas to a velocity distribution of approximately 1 K in 100 ns. A major advancement in the field of low-temperature fundamental physics of antimatter, this study on a purely leptonic system complements work on antihydrogen13, a hadron-containing exotic atom. The successful application of laser cooling to positronium affords unique opportunities to rigorously test bound-state quantum electrodynamics and to potentially realize Bose–Einstein condensation14,15,16,17,18in this matter–antimatter system. The cooling of positronium (Ps) has profound implications for fundamental physics. As the simplest atomic system, consisting of a bound state of two leptons, Ps can serve as a rigorous testing ground for quantum electrodynamics19, one of the most precisely verified theories of modern physics. An example is the measurement of the 1S–2Stransition frequency20,21,22, in which a reduction in the present fractional uncertainty of 2.6 × 10−9is required for a stringent comparison with quantum electrodynamics calculations accurate to 4.7 × 10−10(refs.23,24,25). Reducing systematic errors using cold Ps gas and an optical frequency comb is essential. Moreover, cold Ps atoms can provide a unique experimental platform to search for charge–parity–time reversal (CPT) symmetry breaking in the lepton sector, and investigating the effects of gravity on antimatter26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. Owing to its light mass (twice that of an electron), Bose–Einstein condensation (BEC) is expected to occur at relatively high temperatures, ranging from a few kelvin to several tens of kelvin14,15,16,17,18, compared with ordinary atoms. Discussions regarding the generation of coherent γ-rays using Ps BECs have been noted34,35. Furthermore, cold Ps can be used for efficient antihydrogen generation36. The cooling of Ps is a requisite for such investigations. Despite these high expectations, there has been no demonstration of laser cooling of Ps. The concept of laser cooling of Ps using the 1S–2Ptransition with a natural linewidth of 50 MHz was first explored some 30 years ago37, with some preliminary implementation studies38,39thereafter. Laser cooling with a wide spectral width and long laser duration in a high magnetic field has recently been investigated theoretically40. Laser cooling is an established technique applied to atoms and molecules, based on photon recoil and the Doppler effect. The fundamental mechanism is the reduction in the translational momentum of a moving particle resulting from the absorption of a red-detuned laser photon that propagates counter to the motion and the subsequent emission of a photon in a random direction. Cooling is achieved through repeated cycles of this absorption–emission process. Examples of current laser cooling techniques include Doppler cooling, chirp cooling and magneto-optical traps. Two key characteristics of Ps make its laser cooling challenging—its brief lifetime and the large recoil-induced frequency shift. The triplet 1Sstate of Ps has a lifetime of 142 ns due to pair annihilation into γ-rays, thereby requiring rapid cooling. Furthermore, as Ps is nearly three orders of magnitude lighter than a hydrogen atom, the velocity change associated with the absorption and emission of photons is concomitantly large. The recoil velocityvrdue to a 243-nm-wavelength photon, which induces the 1S–2Ptransition, is approximatelyvr= 1.5 × 103m s–1(equivalent to 55 mK). The large recoil velocity enables rapid deceleration. However, the corresponding change in resonance frequency due to the Doppler effect is 6.2 GHz, which is considerably larger than the natural linewidth of 50 MHz. Therefore, laser cooling halts after one cooling cycle if we use a narrow-bandwidth cooling laser, as commonly used in the Doppler cooling of ordinary atoms. Moreover, the recoil limit temperature is higher than the Doppler limit temperature, in contrast to ordinary atoms and molecules. The Doppler broadening of the 1S–2Ptransition at 300 K extends to approximately 460 GHz at the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). In principle, the cooling of Ps is possible by using a laser pulse with a linewidth of the order of 100 GHz and a long duration, but the resulting temperature is limited to a few tens of kelvin40. Here, to overcome these challenges, we have extended the chirp cooling technique41,42commonly used to decelerate atomic beams. In chirp cooling, the frequency of the laser light changes over time to follow the change in the shifted resonance frequency due to deceleration, maintaining the cooling cycle. If the laser used has a very fast frequency chirp, which adapts to the large recoil-induced shift, substantial Doppler broadening and short lifetime, Ps can be cooled down to the recoil-limited velocity distribution, equivalent to sub-kelvin levels41. We used a previously demonstrated laser43,44that has the potential to realize such cooling. From this tailored laser, which is based on an injection-locked pulsed laser incorporating an electro-optic modulator in the laser cavity, short optical pulses of approximately 0.1 ns duration were successively output every 4.2 ns (Fig.1aand Methods). Each pulse was spectrally continuous with a bandwidth of 8.9 GHz at FWHM, simultaneously covering all 1S–2Ptransition frequencies, triply split over 9.87 GHz. Thus, the pulse served for both cooling and repumping. The repumping prevents the reduction in cooling efficiency due to spin polarization of the 1Sstate during cooling (Methods). The central frequency of the pulse increases with each pulse, and the chirp is linear with a rate of 4.9 × 102GHz μs–1. The duration of the pulse train was adjustable up to approximately 1 μs. This chirped train of optical pulses is denoted here as the cooling laser. By effecting progressive deceleration from fast to slow Ps with chirp cooling in a counter-propagating configuration, we expect to obtain a velocity distribution close to the recoil-limited one. This laser cooling method is anticipated to produce slow Ps atoms in both electrostatic- and magnetostatic-field-free environments, marking an essential advancement in precision spectroscopy. a, Interactions between the laser pulses and Ps. Relevant energy levels are shown up to the total angular momentum. The cooling pulses simultaneously address all the 2Psublevels, followed by relaxation to the 1Slevel by spontaneous emission. In the Doppler profile measurements, we simultaneously excite all the 2Psublevels with the probe pulse. Following excitation, an ionization laser pulse at 532 nm produces photoionized electrons and positrons from the excited Ps atoms in the 2Pstate. The frequencies shown in the figure correspond to the difference in eigenenergies23. The table shows the decay rate for each state.Γann.andΓsp.are the decay rates for the annihilation and spontaneous emission, respectively. Inset in dashed lines, the spectrum of the constituent pulses of the cooling laser changes with time.b, Top view of the experimental setup in the vacuum chamber. The inset shows a bird’s eye view of the setup.c, Timing chart illustrating the sequence of positron injection, laser cooling of Ps and detection of photoionized positrons. The experimental configuration inside the vacuum chamber is shown in Fig.1b. Here we depict the pulsed generation of Ps gas in vacuum, three spatially superimposed laser beams and the acquisition of excitation signals for the 1S–2Ptransitions. The experiment was conducted at the Slow Positron Facility of the Institute of Materials Structure Science, the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Japan. Bunches of 104positrons (16 ns duration, 50 Hz repetition rate)45were guided through a magnetic field, focused by a magnetic lens and injected at room temperature into a sample of silica aerogel, which was used as the Ps formation medium46. Here γ-ray detection using scintillators facilitated the measurement of the arrival time of the positron bunch (Methods). Approximately 3 × 103Ps atoms per positron bunch were released from the silica aerogel into the vacuum on the positron-injection side. Throughout this study, we evaluated the velocity distribution at 125 ns after production. At this point, we estimated that the Ps gas had a spatial spread of nearly 10 mm in the longitudinal and transverse directions, resulting in a density of approximately 103cm−3. The three collimated laser beams encompassed the entirety of the Ps spatial spread. The laser beams consisted of the cooling laser at 243 nm, a nanosecond laser pulse at 243 nm and a nanosecond laser pulse at 532 nm. We evaluated the velocity distribution of Ps by Doppler spectroscopy using the 1S–2Ptransition. Here we refer to the nanosecond laser pulse at 243 nm for Doppler spectroscopy as the probe pulse. The Ps atoms excited to the 2Pstate by the probe pulse were photoionized by the 532 nm pulse before relaxation to the 1Sstate. Photoionized positrons produced were collected by a microchannel plate (MCP) that was driven in a pulsed manner following the end of all the laser pulses, and the output current was converted to a voltage signal. This positron detection method offers high efficiency, enabling measurements to be conducted within a few days of the experimental beam time. Furthermore, the environment was electrostatic-field free until the interaction between Ps and laser pulses was complete. Figure1cshows the timing chart from positron injection for Ps generation to the acquisition of the voltage signal from the MCP. The maximum magnitude of the residual static magnetic flux density was 0.15 mT over the entire experimental setup, indicating that its influence on Ps lifetime was negligible. In the following, the uncertainty of the signal level is dominated by the statistical Poisson uncertainty associated with the detected number of photoionized positrons. Before proceeding with the laser cooling experiment, we examined the Ps gas temperature at 125 ns after the production of Ps from the Doppler profile (Fig.2a). The measurement time for each frequency was approximately 20 min (equivalent to 1.2 × 104measurement cycles; Methods). The profile has a spread around the theoretically known frequency difference between the 13S1and 23P2levels (1,233,599 GHz), reflecting the velocity distribution of Ps atoms in the 1Sstate. The gas temperature was estimated by assuming the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Fitting the data with a model (Methods) that accounts for the 110 GHz spectral width of the multimode probe pulse and Lamb dip associated with the counter-propagating laser beam revealed the gas temperature as 6.1(5) × 102K (the source of the uncertainty is statistical). In aerogels with mean free paths of tens of nanometres46, thermalization is relatively slow. If the Ps species generated by low-energy positrons are emitted into vacuum before fully thermalizing, this could account for the temperature difference between the aerogel and the Ps gas. a, Doppler profile of Ps.Soffis the 1S–2Pexcitation signal without cooling. The horizontal axis is the relative optical frequency of the probe pulse inducing the 1S–2Ptransition, which is evaluated with respect to the frequency difference between the 13S1and 23P2levels of 1,233,599 GHz. The error bars originate from statistical uncertainty in the number of ionized positrons. The dotted curve is a fit based on the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. The shaded area indicates the range of optical frequencies for which we performed laser cooling and detected changes in the Doppler profile.b, Fractional change in the Doppler profile of Ps as a result of laser cooling. We evaluated the fractional change by comparing the 1S–2Pexcitation signals with (Son) and without (Soff) cooling laser irradiation. The filled circles represent the results when the optical frequencies of the cooling laser were set to a detuning suitable for cooling (swept from −59 to −9 GHz). The open circles represent the results of a control experiment with a larger detuning of the cooling laser (swept from −209 to −159 GHz). The dotted curve is a theoretical fitting to the data based on a phenomenological model (Methods). The spectral width of the probe pulse used for fit was 16 GHz. The dashed line is a constant function fitted to the data in a control experiment. In both cooling and control experiments, spectrally narrowed probe pulses were used. To demonstrate laser cooling, we irradiated the Ps gas with the cooling laser for 100 ns to maximize the number of atoms around zero velocity (Methods), commencing at the peak time of the positron pulse injection. The range of the Doppler shift of Ps affected by the cooling laser was approximately ±60 GHz with respect to the central frequency. Although it is possible to target the entire Doppler profile by extending the duration of the cooling laser, this is expected to yield fewer zero-velocity components (Methods). We measured the Doppler profile with an improved frequency resolution in the range mentioned above (Fig.2a, shaded area) to best investigate the changes in the components interacting with the cooling laser. We obtained an optical frequency resolution ranging from 8 to 16 GHz by narrowing the 110 GHz linewidth of the original probe pulse using a Fabry–Pérot etalon (Methods). In the following, the measurement time for each frequency was 4 h, which is equivalent to 7.2 × 104measurement cycles (Methods). Figure2bshows the fractional changes in the Doppler distribution. The excitation signal of the 1S–2Ptransition after irradiation with the cooling laser is defined asSonand the fractional change as (Son−Soff)/Soff. The filled circles show the results obtained when we tuned the optical frequency of the cooling laser to the conditions expected to produce a high cooling efficiency. The optical frequency (detuning) of the cooling laser was adjusted to chirp from approximately 1,233,540 GHz (−59 GHz) to 1,233,590 GHz (−9 GHz) during the 100 ns period. The data show a decrease in the number of Ps in the optical frequency range swept by the cooling laser, accompanied by an approximately threefold increase in the number of Ps near zero velocity within a narrow velocity range, demonstrating the laser cooling of Ps—this result is the anticipated breakthrough achieved using our laser cooling technique. Such an increase in the slow component is essential for reducing systematic and statistical errors in the precision spectroscopy of short-lifetime systems. We quantitatively evaluated the change in the Doppler profile resulting from laser cooling using a phenomenological model (Methods) to fit the measured data, taking into account the frequency resolution. The resultant fit is shown as the dotted curve in Fig.2b. The best-fit value and the upper limit of the FWHM of the decelerated component were 23 and 30 GHz, respectively, which were evaluated by adopting the best resolution of 8 GHz. The corresponding temperatures were 0.8 and 1.4 K, indicating the cooling of velocities equivalent to approximately 1 K. In the frequency range swept by the cooling laser, reductions in the population of the 1Sstate were assessed to be 61% and 49%, respectively. Although the unknown number of delayed Ps released from the silica aerogel (Methods) precludes further quantitative discussion, most of the Ps resonating with the cooling laser were efficiently decelerated, as supported by the subsequent simulation (approximately 70% reduction in the swept frequency region, resulting in approximately 10% of the entire Ps population constituting the cooled component, assuming no delayed Ps release). These results, combined with the threefold enhancement of components near zero velocity, attest to the superior performance of our laser cooling technique. Considering that the unfixed frequency resolution varies between 8 and 16 GHz due to experiment-specific reasons (Methods), the aforementioned cooling performance, determined assuming the best frequency resolution, is probably an underestimate, as suggested by the numerical simulations presented below. A control experiment was also performed in which the cooling laser was largely detuned. We tuned the optical frequency (detuning) to change from approximately 1,233,390 GHz (−209 GHz) to 1,233,440 GHz (−159 GHz) in 100 ns. In this case, Ps in the probed velocity range did not resonate with the cooling laser and no fractional change was expected. The open circles in Fig.2brepresent the fractional changes observed. The dashed line is a constant function fitted to the experimental results, indicating that there was no statistically significant change. Thus, the cooling laser does not impart a velocity change to the Ps that are off-resonant with it. In Doppler spectroscopy, velocity distribution assessment is influenced by frequency resolution and 2Plevel splitting. To examine the presumed velocity distribution indicated in the experimental results, we conducted numerical simulations. We developed a framework to calculate the time evolution of the density matrix based on the Lindblad master equation (Methods). For the time–frequency characteristics and intensity of the cooling laser pulse train, we used parameters that were consistent with our experiments. Moreover, we did not include interatomic interactions and delayed Ps release from the aerogel. Figure3ashows how the velocity distribution of Ps in the 1Sstate changed over time with the cooling laser over a duration of 100 ns. The chirp rate of 4.9 × 102GHz μs–1corresponds to a velocity change of 120 m s–1in 1 ns for Ps that resonate with the cooling laser. The single-pulse linewidth of 8.9 GHz (FWHM) corresponds to a velocity range of Δvsingle= 2,200 m s–1(FWHM) that is covered. a, Velocity distribution of Ps. We set the duration of the cooling pulse train to 100 ns, as in the experiment. The one-dimensional velocity distributions of 1SPs expected at 0, 42, 89 and 127 ns after the beginning of the cooling pulse train are shown. The probability density at each velocity was plotted relative to that at 0 ns. The recoil velocityvrand velocity width Δvsingle(in resonance with the FWHM frequency width of a single pulse in the cooling laser) are also shown.b, Reconstructed fractional change in Doppler profile at 125 ns. The curve shows the simulated results. The thickness originates from the frequency resolution and uncertainty in the uncooled fraction. The filled circles are obtained from Fig.2b. The result at 42 ns (corresponding to a resonance velocity change of approximately 5,000 m s–1) shows that Ps atoms with higher velocities are sequentially decelerated without velocity intermittency and accumulate on the slower side. This corroborates the high deceleration efficiency of our cooling pulse train. At 89 ns (corresponding to a resonance velocity change of approximately 11,000 m s–1), the decelerated Ps atoms were concentrated near zero velocity. The FWHM of the velocity distribution was approximately 3vr, and the corresponding temperature was 0.48 K. At 127 ns, that is, 27 ns after the end of the cooling sequence, most of the excited Ps atoms had relaxed to the 1Sstate. Considering the frequency resolution and the possible delayed Ps release inferred from the fitting above, the simulated distribution quantitatively reproduced (Fig.3b) the fractional change in the Doppler profile (Fig.2b). In the velocity region where there was no interaction with the cooling laser, for example, near a velocity of 18,000 m s–1, the number of Ps decayed by a factor of approximately 1/2.4 at 127 ns due to self-annihilation. However, the number of Ps near zero velocity increased by a factor of three or more compared with that at 0 ns. Note that discrete peak structures were observed in the final velocity distribution. In addition to a distribution that shows an FWHM of approximatelyvr(equivalent to 55 mK) spread around the zero velocity, peaks that are shifted byvrfrom the zero-velocity component appeared. Although further study is needed, these structures indicate a sub-recoil cooling capability, similar to the dark states in Doppler cooling47,48. State-selective cooling in the final stage will be beneficial for the realization of a sub-100-mK Ps gas, eliminating the shifted peaks and transitions that induce residual acceleration. We have successfully demonstrated the one-dimensional chirp cooling of Ps approaching the recoil limit. This innovative chirped cooling method can efficiently cool Ps to a hitherto unexplored narrow velocity range near zero, thereby providing scientific opportunities for this low-temperature, fundamental matter–antimatter bound system. Increased positron number and longer beam time will enable the verification of the sub-Doppler, narrow components indicated by simulations. Several strategies can be used to cool the entire Doppler distribution, such as extended cooling time with the presented chirp rate. The reduction in the number of cooled atoms indicated by our simulations (Methods) will be offset by increasing the slow positron beam intensity. The next natural extension is three-dimensional cooling (see Methods for the Doppler profile in the direction away from the surface of the aerogel; the current configuration did not provide cooling in this dimension), which reduces the second-order Doppler shift of the 1S–2Stransition frequency by more than three orders of magnitude. Despite the two-component velocity distribution, the light mass of Ps aids the spatial separation of the cooled component with time allowing for selective excitation. However, there is a concern that three-dimensional cooling can result in higher temperatures or lower decelerated populations than those reported here because the number of cooling cycles is limited by the annihilation lifetime. One solution is to use the conventional cooling method of thermal contact with low-temperature materials18,49as a precooling method. Enhancing the cooling rate by adopting stimulated emission, as used in atomic and molecular cooling50,51, could also be beneficial. We believe that this more efficient three-dimensional cooling will enable the deceleration of most Doppler-broadened Ps atoms before annihilation, and is important for the realization of BEC in this particle–antiparticle system. The actual required density should be fully investigated because of the lower elastic scattering rates52between Ps at lower temperatures, which can markedly influence the thermalization for inherently short-lifetime systems. When achieved, comparisons with the BECs of excitons in semiconductors53, another exotic atom system with a finite lifetime, will have important implications in quantum statistical physics. A recent publication54submitted on the same date reports the one-dimensional cooling of Ps using the same transition as the present study. This experiment used the irradiation of a broadband, high-intensity cooling laser with a linewidth of approximately 100 GHz (r.m.s.) for a duration of 70 ns. This induced transitions in a broader velocity range of Ps than that in the present study, resulting in cooling from 380(20) to 170(20) K. In our research, we achieved the cooling of Ps over a velocity range equivalent to approximately 50 GHz by irradiating with a chirped train of pulses, each having a linewidth of 8.9 GHz, for 100 ns. Consequently, the Doppler broadening of the cooled components near zero velocity corresponds to approximately 1 K. When a positron pulse is injected into certain media, some positrons form Ps and re-emit as Ps into vacuum. These Ps were used in this laser cooling experiment. Positron pulses, with a width of 16 ns and delivered at a repetition rate of 50 Hz (ref.45), contained approximately 106positrons per pulse. The positrons were transported with an energy of 5 keV from the positron production unit to the experimental station guided by a typical magnetic field of approximately 10 mT generated by coils. By conducting current in the opposite direction only in the last coil, immediately before the experimental station, we minimized the magnetic field in the experimental region. Iron plates for magnetic shielding and the magnetic lens located downstream contributed to this minimization, further reducing the magnetic field in the experimental region to approximately 0.15 mT. This suppresses the Zeeman effect, resulting in a negligible annihilation rate of Ps in the 13S1state (ortho-Ps) due to spin mixing. The transported positrons were focused onto the Ps formation medium using a magnetic lens. Approximately 1% of the incident positrons passed through the magnetic lens, and the remainder collided with the lens and annihilated. The instability in the number of positrons remained at approximately 1% throughout the experiment. We used a silica aerogel, a three-dimensional network of SiO2(silica) nanograins, as the medium for the formation of Ps at room temperature. The silica aerogel had pores with a diameter of 45 nm and a porosity of approximately 95%. The incident angle of the positron bunch on the aerogel was 0° and approximately half the positrons injected into the silica aerogel formed Ps46. Some of the long-livedortho-Ps atoms diffused and came out of the aerogel towards the experimental region.Ortho-Ps atoms decay into γ-rays with a vacuum lifetime of approximately 142 ns and these γ-rays were detected using a LaBr3(Ce) scintillator and a plastic scintillator. The time-resolved γ-ray flux was measured by observing the current output of the coupled photomultiplier tubes. No influence was detected on the Ps from possible electrostatic charging of the silica aerogel. A pulsed laser at 729 nm, which constitutes the backbone of the cooling laser, is called a chirped pulse-train generator43. This is an injection-locked pulsed laser equipped with an intracavity electro-optic phase modulator. It generates a train of approximately 0.1 ns pulses, each with progressively shifting central frequencies. These pulses are then amplified and frequency tripled, producing the 243 nm cooling laser light. The change in the central frequency over time (chirp) can be adjusted by changing the cavity length of the pulsed laser, the driving frequency and the modulation depth of the electro-optic modulator. The duration of the pulse train (the number of micropulses) can also be controlled up to approximately 600 ns, corresponding to a frequency sweep range of approximately 300 GHz using the chirp rate of the present study. Details on the operating principle of the chirped pulse-train generator can be found in ref.43, and specifics regarding the design and performance evaluation of the cooling laser in this experiment are described in ref.44. Although the pulse duration has not yet been precisely measured, based on our measurements with an insufficient temporal resolution and the operating principle of the laser, a 0.1 ns pulse duration is estimated. Although an estimate (rather than a precise measurement), it does not affect the discussions in this paper as it is on a timescale considerably shorter than the natural lifetime of the 2Pstate. Ps atoms emitted into vacuum were irradiated by three different pulsed lasers for chirp cooling in the one-dimensional direction as well as measuring the velocity distribution. The laser beams were incident in a direction orthogonal to the positron beam axis and reflected by a bare aluminium mirror in a counter-propagating configuration. The wavelengths of the light pulses used were 243 and 532 nm, with approximately 93% reflectance off the mirror at these wavelengths. The laser irradiation area was approximately 18 mm in the direction of the positron beam axis and approximately 8 mm in the vertical direction perpendicular to the positron beam axis. The Ps-cooling chirped pulse-train laser was switched on for approximately 100 ns after the positron pulse impacted the silica aerogel. The fluence of a single pulse in an irradiating pulse train was typically 5 μJ cm–2. During the irradiation period (approximately 100 ns), the central frequency of the light pulse was varied from 1,233,540 to 1,233,590 GHz, with a spectral width for a single pulse of 8.9 GHz (FWHM). The cooling laser was linearly polarized with a polarization direction orthogonal to the positron beam direction. The velocity distribution of theortho-Ps in the 1Sstate was evaluated by Doppler spectroscopy using the 1S–2Ptransition. The Doppler profile of the 1Sstate was obtained by measuring the signal associated with the number of positrons produced by ionizing the Ps in the 2Pstate as a function of the probe pulse frequency that resonantly induces the 1S–2Ptransition. The Doppler shift is indicative of the velocity of Ps along the propagation direction of the laser beam, allowing the evaluation of theortho-Ps velocity distribution based on the measured Doppler profile. This measurement was conducted approximately 25 ns after the laser cooling ceased, after the complete de-excitation of the 23PJ-state Ps through spontaneous emission. Doppler spectroscopy was carried out at a 10 Hz repetition rate, and the laser cooling occurred at a 5 Hz rate. By comparing the Doppler profiles before and after laser cooling, changes in the velocity distribution due to cooling can be assessed. The second harmonic of an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) excited by the third harmonic of aQ-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used as the probe laser for Doppler spectroscopy. The pulse duration was approximately 3 ns. The optical frequency of the probe laser was swept at approximately 1.2336 PHz and was measured using a wavelength meter with an accuracy of ±3 pm (corresponding to a frequency accuracy of approximately 15 GHz). Because of the longitudinal multimode nature, the spectral width of the second harmonic of the OPO was approximately 1.1 × 102GHz. This spectral width was too wide to capture the changes in velocity profile resulting from chirp cooling. Therefore, the second harmonic of the OPO was transmitted through a solid etalon to narrow the spectrum and improve the velocity resolution. The measured transmission spectral width of our custom-made solid etalon available at 243 nm varied from 8 to 16 GHz at FWHM, depending on the angle and position of incidence. However, the Doppler broadening of Ps without cooling has an FWHM of approximately\(27\sqrt{T}\)GHz at a temperature ofTK. This corresponds to a frequency width of 470 GHz at room temperature, which is considerably wider than the narrow resolution. To measure the Doppler profile under uncooled conditions and evaluate the temperature, it was unnecessary to spectrally narrow the second harmonic of the OPO. A greater fraction of Ps with a distributed velocity was resonant, resulting in a larger signal. Therefore, we did not use the solid etalon when measuring the Doppler profile under uncooled conditions. The typical incident fluences of the laser pulse that induced the 1S–2Ptransition were 0.27 and 2 μJ cm–2with and without spectral narrowing, respectively. This resulted in comparable light spectral densities for these two cases. The polarization of the laser pulse that induced the 1S–2Ptransition was linear and parallel to the positron beam. For the ionization laser to photoionize Ps in the 23PJstate, we used the second harmonic (532 nm) of aQ-switched Nd:YAG laser with a pulse duration of 5 ns. This ionizing laser pulse was delivered with the timing of the intensity peak adjusted to approximately 1.4 ns later than that of the ultraviolet nanosecond pulse, which induced the 1S–2Ptransition. The irradiation fluence of the 532 nm pulse was typically 15 mJ cm–2. We set the ionization laser to be linearly polarized parallel to the positron beam, similar to the laser that induced the 1S–2Ptransition. The repetition rate of the ionizing laser was 10 Hz, same as that of the laser inducing the 1S–2Ptransition. Ionized positrons, produced with velocity selectivity from the Ps gas by the two-colour pulsed lasers, were drawn into an MCP. The MCP was placed immediately below the interaction region where Ps and the laser beams interacted. We applied a voltage of −2,000 V to the input surface of the MCP to collect the ionized positrons. The MCP was sensitive to the scattered photons of the deep-ultraviolet laser pulses at a wavelength of 243 nm, which resulted in a large background signal. Therefore, a pulsed negative voltage was applied to the MCP input surface after the completion of cooling laser irradiation, with a rise time of approximately 20 ns. Consequently, the MCP gain remained low at the time when the cooling and probe lasers were incident. This reduces the background signal originating from these photons, enabling the highly sensitive detection of ionized positrons. The voltage at the output plane of the MCP was set to 0 V. The amplified electrons were collected at a metal electrode, to which a constant voltage of 1,000 V was applied. The current output from this electrode was converted to a voltage with a 50 Ω resistor, and its time evolution was recorded. Positron signals were observed in the range of approximately 30–80 ns after the pulse voltage was applied, corresponding to the drift time that is dependent on the Ps location at photoionization. Although the background signal originating from the deep-ultraviolet photons was substantially reduced, a residual signal remained. To subtract this contribution, the ionizing laser was switched on and off every 30 s and we evaluated the signal of ionized positrons based on the difference in the integrated signals of the MCP with and without the ionizing laser. When the number of Ps in the whole velocity distribution was approximately 3 × 103immediately after production, the average number of detected positrons in the frequency-resolved measurements was typically 0.5. Consequently, the uncertainty in the excitation signal in the Doppler spectroscopy measurements was characterized by the randomness in the number of ionized positrons, which is governed by Poisson statistics. To achieve an adequate signal-to-noise ratio, it was necessary to set an appropriate measurement time. For the Doppler spectroscopy used to assess the temperature of Ps gas with a frequency resolution of 110 GHz, the integration time for each probe frequency was approximately 20 min. During this integration time, the number of measurement cycles was approximately 1.2 × 104. In the laser cooling experiment, for which the resolution was set to be an order of magnitude greater and thus the signal was weaker, the integration time was approximately 4 h for each probe frequency. During this time, the number of measurement cycles was approximately 7.2 × 104. We estimated the temperature of the Ps emitted from the silica aerogel using the measured Doppler profile. For this purpose, we defined a model function, which was fitted to the data. The model function describes the number of positronsS(ωR) generated by the photoionization process from the 2Pstate as a function of the central angular frequencyωRof the probe pulse that induces the 1S–2Ptransition.S(ωR) is written as whereD(v;T) is the probability density of Ps with velocityvand temperatureT(the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution function is used);ISis the saturation intensity at the 1S–2Ptransition angular frequencyωeg;I(v;ωR) is the light intensity at the angular frequency resonant to a Ps atom with velocityv; andCis a constant and free parameter in the fitting. The second term in the integral represents the photoionization probability of Ps at velocityv. The functional form forS(ωR) was determined using the following relation55: which describes the occupation probability of the excited state in a two-level system when irradiated with light of the transition frequency at intensityIR(see the denominator in the fraction). We used a two-level approximation because we set the spectral width of the probe pulse to be sufficiently wide compared with the splitting in the 1S–2Ptransition frequency.S(ωR), determined usingPe, describes the nonlinear responses to the probe laser pulse, such as the Lamb dip and saturation broadening effects in the present Doppler-broadened case. In our experiment, we directed each laser beam at the Ps in a counter-propagating configuration. Therefore, whereIL(ω;ωR) is the intensity spectrum, described as a function ofω, of the probe pulse with its central angular frequencyωR, andcis the speed of light. We adopted the measured spectral width ofIL(ω;ωR), with the intensity being a free parameter in the fitting. Here we did not include the spatial distributions of light intensity and Ps density. The light intensity of the probe pulse that reproduced the measurement was consistent with the actual light intensity calculated using the fluence, pulse duration and spectral width. This result demonstrates the validity of the proposed model. The Doppler profile in the direction normal to the surface of the silica aerogel (Extended Data Fig.1) was measured by the single-path irradiation of the probe pulse and ionization pulse. These optical pulses (diameter, approximately 10 mm) propagated towards the aerogel 125 ns after the peak timing of the positron bunch. The angles of incidence on the aerogel were 0° for the probe beam and 22° for the positron bunch. The peak of the Doppler profile was observed at a relative frequency of approximately −360 GHz, with an FWHM of approximately 390 GHz. In contrast to the velocity components parallel to the aerogel surface, which are randomly distributed, the distribution of the velocity components perpendicular to the surface cannot be effectively described by a simple distribution function that represents gases or beams. The velocity of Ps moving away from the surface depends not only on its velocity in the generating material but also on its work function. Consequently, the velocity distribution can generally differ from the component parallel to the surface. For these reasons, we did not perform an evaluation by fitting the experimental data. Irrespective of the parallel or perpendicular direction to the surface, the emission velocity of Ps changes dynamically with the reduction in momentum due to scattering with the molecules comprising the aerogel, with the velocity distribution also being influenced by the decay due to the Ps lifetime. We analysed the fractional change in the velocity distribution induced by the cooling laser by fitting the following phenomenological model to the data: the fractional change forSon(f) andSoff(f) is defined as We first used the following raw functions that did not include the frequency resolution in the experiment: where the argumentfis the relative frequency,f0is the 13S1–23P2transition frequency of Ps,mPsis the mass of Ps,kBis the Boltzmann constant andT0is the temperature of Ps released from the silica aerogel. On the basis of the experimental results, we assumed that the Doppler profile of the uncooled Ps was a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at temperatureT0= 600 K. The following free parameters used in the fit describe the change in Doppler profile associated with cooling:fcooledis the Doppler shift corresponding to the optical frequency at the beginning of the cooling laser; Δfis the Doppler width of the decelerated component;Scooledis the signal level after cooling in the spectral region swept by the chirped cooling laser;Acharacterizes the magnitude of the decelerated component signal. These raw functions are plotted in Extended Data Fig.2. We generated model functionsSon(f) andSoff(f), which correspond to the experimental results obtained, by convolving\({S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{raw}}(f)\)and\({S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{raw}}(f)\)with the frequency resolution due to the linewidth of the probe pulse. The change in Doppler profile associated with cooling was quantitatively evaluated by fitting the modelled fractional change to the measured fractional changes. In Extended Data Fig.2,\({S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{raw}}(f)\)is plotted using the parameters obtained from the fit. The fitting parameters varied with the spectral width of the probe pulse, which determined the frequency resolution of the measured Doppler profile. When the spectral width, which varied in the experiment, was set to 8 GHz (narrowest), the widest Doppler spread of the cooling component was evaluated. In the main text, we have shown the corresponding best-fit value (23 GHz) and upper statistical limit (30 GHz) as conservative estimates (the upper statistical limit of the width of the cooled component was evaluated at the 95% confidence level). The population reductions in the cooled spectral region were estimated to be 61% and 49%, respectively. For a spectral width of 16 GHz for the probe pulse, the best-fit value and the upper limit of the width of the cooled component were 18 and 27 GHz, and the corresponding population reductions were 78% and 61%, respectively. We believe that the estimated population reductions were smaller than those expected from population reduction by laser cooling alone, due to the influence of delayed Ps release from the silica aerogel. Such delayed release from porous materials has been reported previously56. Our empirical observations suggest the presence of Ps emitted from the silica aerogel several tens of nanoseconds after the injection of the positron bunch, when we observed the components of zero lateral velocity. However, we cannot quantitatively discuss the delayed fraction due to the absence of available systematic data. The frequency resolution of the fractional change in the Doppler profile as a result of laser cooling was determined using the spectral width of the probe pulse and intensity-dependent saturation broadening. We evaluated the spectral width of the probe pulse using the optical resolution of the Fabry–Pérot solid etalon used for spectral narrowing. The FWHM optical frequency resolution as a function of the angle of incidence is shown in Extended Data Fig.3. The resolution was evaluated by measuring the transmission spectrum of single-longitudinal-mode laser pulses at 243 nm. The spectral width of the pulses is expected to be less than 10 MHz, which is considerably narrower than the designed frequency resolution of the solid etalon, thereby enabling the evaluation of the actual resolution. We measured the transmittance as a function of the angle of incidence of the etalon. All the incident angle sweeps designated in the legend were performed in the direction of increasing angle. These three sets of measurements were performed in the experimental period but not consecutively. The results indicate that although the transmission spectral width tends to increase with the angle of incidence, it varies widely for each measurement. The degree of variation exceeds the measurement uncertainty, suggesting that the conditions of the etalon changed with each sweep. The possible characteristics of the solid etalon that can cause such variations include non-uniform thickness and inhomogeneous strain on the etalon. Variations can then occur because the position of the laser irradiation on the solid etalon cannot be completely fixed. To detect a change in the Doppler profile resulting from laser cooling, the angles of incidence of the probe pulse on the etalon were set in the range tested above, resulting in the same degree of variation in the linewidth of the probe. Therefore, we estimated the spectral width of the probe pulse to be 8–16 GHz, based on the measured range of values shown in Extended Data Fig.3. Next, we examined the influence of saturation broadening, which also affects the frequency resolution. Using the effective intensity calculated from the fluence, pulse duration and spectral width of the spectrally narrowed probe pulse, the degradation of the frequency resolution owing to saturation broadening was at most 1 GHz. Thus, saturation broadening can be neglected. We considered the 8–16 GHz range of the frequency resolution as a systematic uncertainty in the evaluation of the fractional change. Hence, a conservative effective temperature was evaluated. Here we describe the allowed transitions and their intensities among the 13S–23Ptransitions used for laser cooling and Doppler spectroscopy. The transition matrix element is wheredis the electric dipole moment;Eis the electric field of light;n,LandSare the principal quantum number, orbital angular momentum and total spin angular momentum, respectively;JandMare the total angular momentum and its projection along the quantization axis, respectively. Subscripts e and g indicate the excited and ground states, respectively. The electric dipole moments, when we define the quantization axis of the atomic orbitals as thezaxis, are shown in Extended Data Fig.4a,b. The direction of projection of the electric dipole moment is shown at the top of each diagram. The allowed transitions induced by the electric field of light with the corresponding polarization vectors are represented by arrows. The numbers associated with the arrows indicate the square of the absolute value of each component of the electric dipole moment normalized to the following constant: whereeis the elementary charge anda0is the Bohr radius. For some transitions, the numbers are omitted because the absolute values of the electric dipole moments coincide with those of the other transitions that differ only in the sign ofM. The transition rates are proportional to the values shown in Extended Data Fig.4afor linearly polarized light parallel to thezaxis, and in Extended Data Fig.4bfor orthogonally polarized light. In our experiment, the polarizations of the cooling laser pulse and probe laser pulse in Doppler spectroscopy were linear and orthogonal to each other. Extended Data Fig.4a,bcan be used to evaluate the transition intensity of each pulse. Extended Data Fig.4cshows the spontaneous emission rates from the excited states to each ground state normalized by the total decay rateΓsp.≅3.13 × 108s–1from each excited state. By symmetry, the spontaneous emission rates from the states with negativeMevalues, which are omitted from the table in Extended Data Fig.4c, are equal to the corresponding rates between the states with the signs forMeandMgreversed. Extended Data Fig.4a–cshows that in the cooling process, during which the transitions are repeated many times, it is important to use a cooling laser with a spectral width comparable with the splitting in the transition. Otherwise, if we repeat the cooling cycle by transitioning to the 23P0and 23P1states, for example, the 13S1state becomes polarized and eventually makes transitions to these excited states dark. Moreover, the 13S1–23P2transition dominated the 1S–2Ptransitions. Therefore, we present our experimental results as functions of frequency relative to the 13S1–23P2frequency difference. Note that the resonance frequency observed at the one-photon transition is approximately 3 GHz higher than this frequency difference owing to the conservation laws of energy and momentum. We evaluated the time evolution of the momentum distribution of Ps under the influence of a cooling laser based on the Lindblad master equation: wheret,ħ,HandL(ρ) are the time, Dirac’s constant, Hamiltonian and Liouvillian, respectively. We considered the density matrixρin the space spanned by the simultaneous eigenstates of the momentum of Ps and atomic configurations in theL–Scoupling scheme. The interaction between Ps and the photon field was incorporated as an electric dipole interaction. This framework can describe the transitions between atomic orbitals through absorption, stimulated emission and spontaneous emission processes, as well as momentum changes because of photon recoil. We incorporated the relaxation of Ps due to annihilation processes into the master equation as a longitudinal relaxation process. Using the simulated velocity distribution shown in Fig.3a, we can simulate the fractional change (Fig.2b). The simulated Doppler profiles with and without the cooling laser irradiation were convolved by the spectral resolution to obtain\({S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)\)and\({S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)\), respectively. The spectral width of the probe pulse determines the spectral resolution. The argumentfis the relative frequency, which is the first-order Doppler shift calculated from the velocity of Ps. To express a part of the probed Ps atoms, which interacted with the cooling laser, we introduce an uncooled Ps fractionr. The fractional change can then be calculated as\((1-r)\frac{{S}_{\text{on}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)-{S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)}{{S}_{\text{off}}^{\text{sim}}(\,f)}\). The parameterrwas determined by fitting this function to the measured data. Figure3bcompares the measured and simulated fractional changes. The filled circles are identical to those shown in Fig.2b. The thickness of the curve was determined on the basis of the frequency resolution in the range of 8–16 GHz. The measured data were well reproduced, with the best estimatedrranging from 0.18 to 0.40 and the spectral resolution shown above. The statistical uncertainty of the estimatedris typically 0.06 at the 1σconfidence level. The resultant fractionris reasonable under the experimental condition, and its consistency with the measured data supports the successful demonstration of the laser cooling of Ps. Extended Data Fig.5presents the corresponding Doppler profiles mentioned above. Similar to the experiment, the simulation evaluated the Doppler profiles 125 ns after Ps formation, following 100 ns of cooling laser irradiation. Components resonating with the frequency-swept cooling laser were decelerated and concentrated in the frequency domain corresponding to zero velocity. Compared with the case without cooling, the slow components showed a threefold increase. No change was observed in the detuned components, which did not resonate with the cooling laser. To illustrate the parameter design of the cooling laser in this study, we present typical examples of cooling time dependence and chirp rate dependence based on the simulations constructed here. Extended Data Fig.6adisplays the momentum distribution after cooling, evaluated as a function of cooling time while keeping the chirp rate constant. The optical frequency detuning of the cooling laser at the end of cooling was set to −9 GHz. As the cooling duration is extended, the sweep frequency range of the cooling laser increases, thereby enhancing the contrast in number between the cooled and uncooled components. However, due to the lifetime effects of Ps, the number of cooled atoms is found to decrease compared with shorter cooling times. The maximum number of cooled atoms is achieved at a cooling time of approximately 100 ns, which is the duration used in this study. Extended Data Fig.6bshows the momentum distribution after cooling when the chirp rate is varied, with the cooling time fixed at 100 ns. When the chirp rate exceeds the rate characterized by the recoil frequency associated with photon absorption and the natural emission rate, the proportion of atoms that cannot maintain the chirp cooling cycle increases, resulting in decreased efficiency. Note that this calculation assumes that the entire volume of the Ps gas is constantly exposed to the cooling laser.

The negative detuning indicates the direction away from the surface and the horizontal axis is intentionally reversed. The Doppler distribution of uncooled Ps follows the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, and the possible changes in the Doppler profile by cooling are characterised by parametersA,Scooled, Δf, andfcooled(defined in the text).

Irradiation by the cooling laser commenced at time zero.a, Dependence on the duration of the cooling laser. The chirp rate of the up-chirping cooling laser was the same as in the experiments of the present work, at 4.9 × 102GHz/μs, and cooling was terminated at −9 GHz relative to the 1S-2P transition frequency at rest. The durations were 40 ns, 100 ns, 200 ns and 400 ns. Due to computational resource constraints, calculation of the largely detuned components was truncated.b, Dependence on the chirp rate of the cooling laser. We set the chirp rates at 1.7 × 102GHz/μs, 5.0 × 102GHz/μs, 8.4 × 102GHz/μs and 11.7 × 102GHz/μs. Cooling was terminated at −9 GHz relative to the stationary Ps 1S-2P transition frequency. The duration of the cooling laser was fixed at 100 ns. While a larger chirp rate allows for interaction with a broader velocity range, the efficiency of cooling decreases because the frequency of the cooling laser changes by more than the recoil frequency during the relaxation time due to natural emission from the 2 P state.

Positronium is an exotic atom composed of a single negative electron and a positively charged antimatter positron. It is naturally very short-lived, but researchers including those from the University of Tokyo successfully cooled and slowed down samples of positronium using carefully tuned lasers. They hope this research will help others explore exotic forms of matter, and that such research might unlock the secrets of antimatter.
Some of our universe is missing. You may have heard such a bizarre statement if you’ve read much about cosmology in the last few decades. The reason scientists say this is because almost all the stuff we see in the universe is made from matter, including you and the planet you’re standing on. However, for a long time we’ve known about antimatter, which as the name suggests, is sort of the opposite of regular matter, in that antimatter particles share the same mass and other properties of their matter counterparts, but have an opposite charge. When matter and antimatter particles collide, they annihilate, and it’s widely believed they were created in equal amounts at the dawn of time. But that’s not what we see now.
“Modern physics only accounts for a part of the total energy of the universe. The study of antimatter might help us account for this discrepancy, and we’ve just taken a big step in this direction with our latest research,” said Associate Professor Kosuke Yoshioka from the Photon Science Center. “We have successfully slowed and cooled down exotic atoms of positronium, which is 50% antimatter. This means that for the first time, it can be explored in ways previously impossible, and that will necessarily include a deeper study of antimatter.”
Positronium sounds like something straight out of science fiction, and despite being very short-lived, it is very much a real thing. Think of it like the familiar atom hydrogen, with its central, positively charged and relatively large proton and tiny, negatively charged electron in orbit, except you swap the proton for the antimatter version of the electron, the positron. This yields an exotic atom which is electrically neutral but doesn’t have a large nucleus; instead the electron and positron exist in mutual orbit, making it a two-body system. Even hydrogen is a multibody system, as a proton is really three smaller particles, called quarks, stuck together. And because positronium is a two-body system, it can be completely described by traditional mathematical and physical theories, making it ideal to test predictions with extreme accuracy.
“For researchers like us, involved in what is called precision spectroscopy, being able to precisely examine the properties of cooled positronium means we can compare them with precise theoretical calculations of its properties,” said Yoshioka. “Positronium is one of the few atoms made up entirely of only two elementary particles, which allows for such exact calculations. The idea of cooling positronium has been around for around 30 years, but a casual comment by undergraduate student Kenji Shu, who is now an assistant professor in my group, prompted me to take on the challenge of achieving it, and we finally did.”
Yoshioka and his team had several difficulties to overcome when trying to cool positronium. Firstly, there is the issue of its short life: one-ten millionth of a second. Secondly, there is its extreme light mass. As it’s so lightweight, you can’t use a cold physical surface or other substance to cool positronium down, so the team used lasers. You may think lasers are very hot, but really, they are just packets of light, and it’s the way the light is used that determines the physical impact it has on something. In this case, a weak and finely tuned laser gently pushes against a positronium atom in the opposite direction to its movement, slowing it down and cooling it in the process. Doing this repeatedly and in as little as one-ten millionth of a second cooled portions of positronium gas down to about 1 degree above absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius), the coldest anything can get. Given positronium gas is at 600 kelvins, or 327 degrees Celsius, before cooling, this is quite a dramatic change in such a short space of time.
“Our computer simulations based on theoretical models suggest that the positronium gas might be even colder than we can currently measure in our experiments. This implies that our unique cooling laser is very effective at reducing the temperature of positronium and the concepts can hopefully help researchers study other exotic atoms,” said Yoshioka. “This experiment used a laser in just one dimension, however, and if we utilize all three, we can measure the properties of positronium even more precisely. These experiments will be significant because we may be able to study the effect of gravity on antimatter. If antimatter behaves differently to regular matter due to gravity, it could help explain why some of our universe is missing.”

				Pages 406-418 (compatible with EndNote, Reference Manager, ProCite, RefWorks) (compatible with BibDesk, LaTeX) Cementitious materials generally have large carbon footprints because of the high CO2emitted during Portland cement production. This is because limestone is used as an essential CaO resource, and its decomposition by calcination emits CO2. From this perspective, the concrete in urban buildings can be considered an urban mine of CaO resources. In this study, we propose obtaining a solidified product by crushing all the waste concrete, carbonating it, pressurizing it with a calcium bicarbonate solution, and drying it. The experimental results show that the bicarbonate solution, high-temperature conditions, and extended loading period produce a higher strength. In addition, neck growth at the contact surfaces of the carbonated concrete fines was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy. Consequently, the proposed method indicates that the hardening mechanism is the cold sintering of calcium carbonate on the surface of fine-carbonated concrete particles. This method allows the developed blocks to be used semi-permanently with relatively low energy consumption through repeated crushing and re-pressurization.

Sign inhere","Researchers led by a team at the University of Tokyo have turned concrete from a demolished school building and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air into new blocks strong enough to build a house with. The process involved grinding the old concrete into powder, reacting it with CO2from the air, pressurizing it in layers in a mold and finally heating it to form the new block. Instead of making buildings from new concrete only, this technique could offer a way to recycle old materials while also trapping carbon dioxide in the process. The blocks could theoretically be remade again and again, through the same process.
A few years ago, researchers developeda new kind of concrete, which had the potential to reduce greenhouse gases and reuse waste from the construction industry.
The project was named C4S, which stands for Calcium Carbonate Circulation System for Construction, and led by Professor Takafumi Noguchi, as project manager, with Professor Ippei Maruyama leading on material development. Both researchers are from the Department of Architecture at the University of Tokyo. Together with a team they developed a method to combine old concrete with carbon dioxide, taken from the air or industrial exhaust, to create a new, durable material called calcium carbonate concrete. However, the resulting blocks were only a few centimeters long.
Now, they have taken this technology to the next level.
“We can make calcium carbonate concrete bricks large and strong enough to build regular houses and pavements,” said Maruyama. “These blocks can theoretically be used semipermanently through repeated crushing and remaking, a process which requires relatively low energy consumption. Now, concrete in old buildings can be thought of as a kind of urban mine for creating new buildings.”
Limestone is a key ingredient in Portland cement, which is typically used to make concrete. The rock provides durability and strength, while improving workability. However, limestone reserves are limited, and in some countries more than others, such as Japan. So attention is switching from creating new materials to maintaining and reusing what is already available.
“We are trying to develop systems that can contribute to a circular economy and carbon neutrality. In Japan, the current demand for construction material is less than in the past, so it is a good time to develop a new type of construction business, while also improving our understanding of this vital material through our research,” explained Maruyama.
Demolished concrete from a school building was crushed into a fine powder, sieved and then carbonated over three months. Carbonation is usually a slow, natural process which occurs when compounds in concrete, such as portlandite and calcium silicate hydrate, react with CO2in the air to form calcium carbonate. The researchers performed a sped-up version of this process to recreate the same kind of concrete you would find in older buildings. This was to test that they could still make strong new blocks even from older concrete.
The carbonated powder was then pressurized with a calcium bicarbonate solution and dried. In their previous experiment, the team created calcium carbonate concrete by pouring a bicarbonate solution through carbonated concrete powder and heating it. In this updated version, as well as heating the material, the team built the concrete up in layers in a mold, which compacted it under pressure. They found this enhanced the strength of the blocks.
“As part of the C4S project, we intend to construct a real two-story house by 2030,” said Maruyama. “Over the next few years, we also plan to move to a pilot plant, where we can improve production efficiency and industrial application, and work on creating much larger building elements, as we move towards making this material commercially available.”

Talking about regeneration,"Advertisement BMC Biologyvolume22, Article number:157(2024)Cite this article 2043Accesses 107Altmetric Metricsdetails The remarkable regenerative abilities observed in planarians and cnidarians are closely linked to the active proliferation of adult stem cells and the precise differentiation of their progeny, both of which typically deteriorate during aging in low regenerative animals. While regeneration-specific genes conserved in highly regenerative organisms may confer regenerative abilities and long-term maintenance of tissue homeostasis, it remains unclear whether introducing these regenerative genes into low regenerative animals can improve their regeneration and aging processes. Here, we ectopically express highly regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs) inDrosophila, a widely used low regenerative model organism. Surprisingly, HRJD expression impedes tissue regeneration in the developing wing disc but extends organismal lifespan when expressed in the intestinal stem cell lineages of the adult midgut under non-regenerative conditions. Notably, HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions. These findings together suggest that the introduction of highly regenerative species-specific genes can improve stem cell functions and promote a healthy lifespan when expressed in aging animals. Regeneration, an intricate process that rebuilds lost body parts, is a widespread phenomenon among metazoans, but the capacity for regeneration displays significant variation across different groups and species [1,2,3,4,5]. While certain animals like planarians and hydras possess the remarkable ability to regenerate their entire body from a small fragment, other groups with more complex body structures, such as mammals and insects, exhibit a diminished regenerative potential and can only regenerate specific tissues and/or organs to a limited extent. Furthermore, regenerative capacity often declines with aging in most species with limited regeneration abilities [2], resulting in increased susceptibility to organismal death upon injury. In contrast, animals that can achieve whole body regeneration, along with developmental reversion observed in the jellyfishTurritopsis, exhibit potential immortality [2,5,6]. Understanding the mechanisms underlying high regenerative ability and their relationship with aging represents a fundamental challenge in the field of developmental biology and gerontology with implications for regenerative medicine. Several cellular and molecular factors have been identified as determinants of regeneration capacity. Highly regenerative animals such as planarians and cnidarian polyps rely on pluripotent adult stem cells, called neoblasts and interstitial cells (i-cells), respectively [2,3,4,5,7]. These stem cells migrate to the injury sites and contribute to the formation of a blastema, an undifferentiated cellular mass, enabling the restoration of amputated body structures. Some vertebrates like salamanders and fish, which do not possess adult pluripotent stem cells, can regenerate organs after injury by recruiting blastema cells through dedifferentiation and/or the activation of quiescent lineage-restricted stem cells [1,2,4,5,8]. At the molecular level, the evolutionary conserved WNT signaling pathway promotes a wide range of regenerative events across species, including blastema formation in newts andHydra[1,2,3,4,5,8]. In contrast to the conserved regulators of regeneration, several genes are specific to highly regenerative animal groups and species: for instance, the newt geneProd1regulates re-patterning during limb regeneration [9,10], and viropana family (viropana 1–5) is upregulated during lens regeneration [11,12]. These species/group-specific genes might explain differences in regeneration capacity between species. Remarkably, ectopic expression ofviropana 1–5can enhance regeneration of the primordium ofDrosophilaeyes that maintain regenerative capacity during development [12]. This finding raises the possibility that heterologous induction of regenerative genes may accelerate tissue regeneration, at least in developing animals, and potentially provide a cue for developing novel regenerative therapies. However, it remains unknown whether heterologously-induced regenerative genes can improve regenerative and/or aging processes even when induced in post-developmental mature adults. Notably, given that basal metazoans such as Porifera, Ctenophore, Placozoa, and Cnidaria all exhibit robust regenerative abilities, it is conceivable that a common ancestor of all metazoans once possessed a high regenerative potential and independently lost genes related to high regenerative capacity in multiple phyla. Building upon this hypothesis, bioinformatics analysis has identified genes that are common among species with high regenerative abilities and absent in species with limited regenerative capacities (Fig.1A) [13]. Thehighlyregenerative species-specificJmjCdomain-encoding genes (HRJDs) are a group of such genes (with typically two or three orthologs per species) characterized by their JmjC domain (Fig.1A), yet their molecular functions remain unknown. Given their potential influence on the regenerative process, HRJDs may contribute to the high regeneration potential of highly regenerative animals. With this in mind, a question arises: what would happen if a low regenerative species, which has lost HRJDs, were to acquire them again? By ectopically expressing HRJDs in low regenerative animal models, we can investigate their impacts on regeneration as well as on aging processes, providing insight into the role of HRJDs. HRJD expression in whole body does not affect gross morphology.APhylogenetic tree of HRJD conservation. Green indicates species that possess HRJD gene(s) and gray indicates species that have lost HRJD gene(s). High regenerative ability indicates that the species can regenerate their whole body or anterior/posterior body parts, and low regenerative ability indicates that the species can only regenerate their appendage (limbs, tails, fins) or much smaller scale of tissues/organs. We referred to Cao et al. (2019) for the definition of regenerative ability [13].BProtein sequence of HRJDs used in this study, which derived fromDugesia japonica(DjHRJDa/b, hereafter simply described as HRJDa/b).

See also Additional file1: Fig. S1 Here, we express HRJDs in the fruit flyDrosophila melanogasterand evaluate their impact in vivo, especially by focusing on two epithelial tissues: developing wing discs and post-developmental adult midguts, both of which exhibit regeneration potential and can replenish damaged epithelial cells. In contrast to the predicted contribution of HRJDs in regeneration as observed in planarian, ectopic HRJD induction impedes regenerative responses and decreases organismal survival upon injury inDrosophila. Surprisingly, however, HRJD expression in the stem/progenitor population of the adult midguts extends organismal lifespan under the non-regenerative condition. Further investigations reveal that HRJDs enhance the proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells while keeping their differentiation fidelity in aged guts, ameliorating age-related decline in gut barrier functions. These findings provide evidence that genes specific to highly-regenerative animals can improve stem cell function as well as increase healthy lifespan upon heterologous expression in aging animals. Planarians are one of the most highly regenerative animals; they are capable of regenerating most body parts upon amputation and can even reconstruct their whole body from fragments [1,2,3,4,8,14]. Previous work has identified two HRJD orthologsHRJDaandHRJDbfrom two planarian species,Dugesia japonicaandSchmidtea mediterranea, where both HRJDs contain only the JmjC domain and the EF hand motif (Fig.1B) [13]. In functional assays using RNAi-mediated knockdown inD. japonica, these two HRJDs affect viability of organisms after amputation [13], suggesting that planarian HRJDs are associated with regeneration processes. We thus utilized these functional HRJDs inD. japonicaas representatives for the following studies and hereafter simply named them as HRJDa and HRJDb. To examine potential benefits and/or disadvantages of acquiring HRJDs, we then ectopically expressed HRJDs inDrosophila melanogaster, which has lost HRJD genes during evolution (Fig.1A), using the Gal4/UAS system (Additional file1: Fig. S1) [15]. We first introduced HRJDs in the whole body throughout development with the ubiquitous driverAct5C-Gal4(Fig.1C,Act5C-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b). The whole body expression of HRJDs neither caused developmental lethality nor changed the body weight of mature adults compared with theAct5C-Gal4>UAS-GFPcontrol (Fig.1D, E). We further assessed the gross morphology of adult wings and eyes under the ubiquitous expression of HRJDs. The wing size was not altered by HRJD expression (Fig.1F, G). Similarly,Act5C-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/bflies did not change the size of adult compound eyes (Fig.1H,I). These results indicate that HRJD expression does not disturb gross morphology of adult flies under homeostatic conditions, likely due to minimal impacts on developmental processes. Given that HRJDs are conserved only among highly regenerative animals, their primary functions may be related to regeneration processes. Indeed, both planarian HRJDa and HRJDb function in whole-body regeneration while their relative contribution is likely context-dependent: HRJDa is indispensable for the regeneration of amputated heads while HRJDb promotes organismal survival after two consecutive amputations [13]. To test whether heterologously-induced HRJDs can enhance regenerative responses inDrosophila, we examined their impacts on regeneration after ablation of the developing wing imaginal disc. TheDrosophilalarval imaginal discs, including wing discs, which are composed of columnar epithelial cells, exhibit regenerative capacity and restore morphology even after massive cell death [16,17] (Fig.2A, B). We utilized the genetic ablation system in which transient overexpression ofeiger, aDrosophila TNF ligand, induces apoptosis in the wing pouch region [17,18]. In this tissue ablation system, the temperature-sensitive form of the Gal4 repressor Gal80 (tub-Gal80ts) allows transient tissue ablation under the control of a wing pouch driverrn-Gal4.To circumvent the temporal expression associated with the Gal4/Gal80tssystem, we further introduced an additional binary expression system: the QF/QUAS system for HRJD induction (Fig.2A) [19,20]. When expressing HRJDs in the wing pouch with theWP-QF2driver during the entire process of recovery, we found thatWP-QF2>QUAS-HRJDsflies exhibit severe defects compared to controls (Fig.2C). Immunostaining of a mitotic marker, phosphohistone H3 (PH3), revealed that HRJD expression did not cause statistically significant difference in regenerative proliferation in the wing pouch (Fig.2D, E). Nevertheless, it is possible that insufficient damaged cell replenishment may occur in these conditions. Importantly, HRJD induction in the wing disc affected neither the development of the adult wing nor proliferation in wing discs under homeostatic condition (Fig.2F–I). These results suggest that HRJD expression does not facilitate regeneration in the developing wing disc epithelium.

Scale bars: 20 μm Most highly regenerative animals exhibit regeneration potential in mature adult stages [2,3,4,8], and thus one possibility is that HRJDs stimulate regenerative responses only in adults, where tissue-resident stem cells play an important role in homeostasis and regeneration. We thus tested the impact of HRJD expression on the regenerative capacity of theDrosophilaadult midgut. In the adult midgut, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) self-renew ISCs themselves and also generate differentiating progenitor cells called enteroblasts (EBs) and enteroendocrine progenitors (EEPs), which eventually differentiate into absorptive enterocytes (ECs) and secretory enteroendocrine cells (EEs), respectively (Fig.3A) [21,22,23,24]. The adult midgut activates proliferation of ISCs in response to orally-treated harmful chemicals such as paraquat and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a regenerative response that is essential for organismal survival [21,25,26,27,28]. We thus expressed HRJDs in ISCs and EBs using theesg-Gal4(esg-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b) driver and tested survival against paraquat/DSS damage. Similar to the wing regeneration assay, continuous expression of HRJDs viaesg-Gal4significantly impaired organismal survival upon the chemical challenges, with a stronger effect for HRJDa (Additional file1: Fig. S2A and S2B). By contrast, survival during 11 days of control feeding (5% sucrose) was not significantly decreased by HRJD expression (Additional file1: Fig. S2C), raising a possibility that abnormal regenerative response compromises the survival upon intestinal damage. We thus examined ISC proliferation after paraquat feeding by counting the number of cells marked with a mitotic marker, anti-PH3 staining, and found that induction of HRJDa significantly suppressed ISC division (Additional file1: Fig. S2D), which is consistent with the stronger decline in survival rate. Concordant with the wing ablation experiments, these results suggest that continuous HRJD expression causes detrimental effects to regenerative capacity. HRJD expression compromises regeneration in the adult midgut.ASchematics of theDrosophilaadult midgut.

See also Additional file1: Fig. S2 Because theesg-Gal4driver is active not only in adult ISCs/EBs but also in the proliferative adult midgut progenitors in the larval midguts and larval imaginal discs [29,30], continuous HRJD expression may cause internal organ defects associated with development. To temporally restrict HRJD expression to the adult stage, we next set up an experiment where HRJD expression starts only in adults after eclosion from pupa by combiningesg-Gal4withtub-Gal80ts(esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/b) (Fig.3B); however, neither HRJDa nor HRJDb improved organismal survival upon paraquat/DSS feeding (Fig.3C, D). Instead, HRJDa expression caused a slight but significant decrease in survival rate compared to controls (esg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFP), while HRJDb expression did not lead to a statistically significant decline of survival (Fig.3C, D). Survival under control feeding (5% sucrose) was comparable betweenesg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFPandesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/b(Fig.3E), suggesting that the impaired survival ofesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDais specific to regenerative contexts. We also found that, after paraquat feeding, mitotic cell numbers in HRJD expressing flies decreased slightly (Fig.3F, G), suggesting the possibility of impaired regeneration. These results indicate that post-developmental expression of HRJDs does not enhance intestinal regeneration in adult flies. Highly-regenerative animals are often resistant to organismal aging and have long lifespan; some species like the jellyfishTurritopsiseven revert their early developmental stages under harsh environments and are considered to be potentially immortal [2,6]. Although heterologous expression of HRJDs does not augment tissue regeneration in either developing or adultDrosophilatissues, we further investigated whether HRJDs influence organismal lifespan under homeostatic conditions in which no experimental injuries are applied to fly adults. We observed that post-developmental HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs (esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/b) significantly extended organismal lifespan both in females (Fig.4A) and males (Fig.4B). In contrast, continuous HRJD expression in the whole body (Act5C-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b) shortened males’ lifespan (Fig.4C, D). Moreover, HRJD expression in differentiated ECs (NP1-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa/b) also negatively impacted female lifespan, likely due to developmental abnormalities since EC-specific HRJD expression in the adult stage did not decrease survival (Additional file1: Fig. S3A-S3D). These results suggest that spatio-temporally regulated induction of HRJDs in adult ISCs/EBs can be beneficial for adult flies under homeostatic conditions.

See also Additional file1: Fig. S3 Further investigation revealed the distinct impacts of HRJDa and HRJDb on organismal lifespan: while continuous expression of HRJDa viaesg-Gal4 (esg-Gal4>UAS-HRJDa)shortened lifespans for both males and females,esg-Gal4>UAS-HRJDbprolonged female lifespans but shortened male lifespans (Additional file1: Fig. S3E and S3F). The ortholog-dependent phenotypic differences were also reported in planarian regeneration [13]. To address the mechanisms of lifespan extension associated with post-developmental HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs, we focused onesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDsmidguts in the following experiments. Age-related mortality accompanies intestinal barrier dysfunction and disruption of cell–cell junction in the gut epithelium across species [31,32,33,34]. Given that aging phenotypes are more severe in female flies than male flies [35], we first tested barrier function of theesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bfemale midgut using the Smurf assay, in which orally-administered blue dye spreads throughout the entire body when the intestinal barrier is disrupted (Smurf + , Fig.5A) [31,35]. Consistent with lifespan extension, post-developmental HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs significantly decreased the ratio of Smurf + adults at 30 days old, a time point where age-related organismal death starts (Fig.4A and Fig.5A), suggesting that barrier function is maintained in aged flies that express HRJDs in ISCs/EBs. We further assessed the localization of septate junction markers (Dlg, Tsp2A, Mesh, Ssk), which diffuse in cytoplasm in the aged midgut [33,36,37,38]. The diffusion of the Dlg protein in aged midguts was significantly suppressed inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bmidguts (Fig.5B, C). Similarly, peripheral localization of Tsp2A, Mesh, and Ssk proteins was also maintained inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bmidguts compared with control (esg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFP) midguts (Fig.5D–I). Given that HRJDs in ISCs/EBs affect localization of junctional components in ECs, we next tested if HRJDs non-autonomously affect junctional integrity. To this end, we performed a mosaic experiment where HRJDs were clonally induced using the esgFLPout system [26]. Clonal induction of HRJDs improved junctional localization of Ssk both inside and outside the clones (Additional file1: Fig. S4A and S4B), supporting the conclusion that HRJDs’ effect is non-cell autonomous. We then examined JNK activation in ECs, which is associated with barrier dysfunction in the aged intestine [27,36]. HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs significantly repressed transcription ofpuckered(puc), a downstream target of JNK signaling in the whole midgut (Fig.5J), and indeed the intensity ofpuc-lacZreporter decreased in ECs upon HRJD induction (Fig.5K,L). HRJD expression in ISCs/EBs thus suppresses JNK signaling in ECs in the aged midgut, which is mediated by either a non-autonomous function of HRJDs or residual HRJD proteins in newly differentiated ECs. These results indicate that HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs contributes to the prolonged maintenance of the junctional integrity as well as gut barrier function in the aged intestine. HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs suppresses age-related gut barrier dysfunction.Aesgts-mediated HRJD induction decreased Smurf( +) ratio at day 30.

Scale bars: 50 μm In addition to the intestinal barrier dysfunction, aberrant activation of ISC mitosis and accumulation of mis-differentiated ISC progenies are also common age-related phenotypes in theDrosophilaadult midgut [27,31,33,39]. In 30-days old control midguts,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-GFP+cells exhibited hallmarks of age-related mis-differentiation into ECs such as increased ploidy and enlarged nuclear size (Fig.6A) [27]. By contrast, we found that HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs suppressed these mis-differentiation phenotypes (Fig.6A, B), which are consistent with the amelioration of age-related barrier dysfunction inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bmidguts. Surprisingly, however,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDa/bdid not suppress age-related increase in ISC proliferation but rather enhanced it in 30-day old midguts (Fig.6C, D). The enhancement of ISC proliferation was specific to the aged intestine sinceesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDsdid not affect PH3+cell number in 10-day-old young midguts (Additional file1: Fig. S4E). These results raised the possibility that HRJD expression augments the mitotic activity of stem cells while maintaining their differentiation fidelity during aging.

Scale bars: 50 μm To test this hypothesis, we first measured the expression of cell type markers (Deltafor ISCs,nubfor ECs, andprosfor EEs) by RT-qPCR of whole midguts. Bothnubandprosare negatively regulated by Esg [40,41], and accumulation ofesg+mis-differentiated cells accompanies the downregulation of EC-related genes in aged midguts [27]. Consistent with enhanced ISC proliferation,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDasignificantly upregulatedDelta(Dl) expression in 30-day old midguts (Fig.6E). More importantly,esg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDaalso upregulatednubandpros, which supports our hypothesis that HRJDs improve proper differentiation of ISC progenies. Inesg-Gal4ts>UAS-HRJDb, onlyDl, but notnubandpros, was upregulated when whole midguts were used as sample (Fig.6E). Next, we focused on the posterior midgut where both HRJDa and HRJDb prevent mis-differentiation of EBs (Fig.6A) and examined cell type composition using the combination of markersesgts>GFP(ISC/EB),Dl-lacZ(ISC/EEP), and anti-Pros (EEP/EE). Consistent with the prevention of EB mis-differentiation,esgts-mediated HRJD expression decreased EBs (esg+Dl−Pros−) and increased polyploid ECs (esg−Dl−Pros−) compared to the control midgut (Fig.6F, G). These results indicate that HRJDs improve differentiation fidelity in ISC lineage. To address the potential mechanism of HRJD-dependent maintenance of ISC functions, we focused on the JAK-STAT pathway since its activation promotes both ISC proliferation and differentiation into ECs [26,42,43]. In young mature midguts, STAT activity is largely restricted toesg+ISCs/EBs [26,42,44]. In aged midguts, however, a subset of polyploid cells exhibited weak signal of the STAT reporter10×STAT-GFP, likely due to the accumulation of mis-differentiated EBs (Fig.6H). Notably, HRJD induction canceled such ectopic STAT activation in polyploid cells and rather enhanced STAT activity in diploid ISCs/EBs (Fig.6H,I), which is consistent with our observations that HRJDs boost ISC functions during aging. These results suggest that HRJD expression accelerates the generation of differentiated ECs via JAK-STAT activation. In the healthy homeostatic intestine, ISC division and subsequent differentiation into ECs is coupled with the loss of old ECs [45,46]. Interestingly, we found thatesg-lineage clones that express HRJDs rapidly replaced pre-existing cells by generating polyploid ECs (Additional file1: Fig. S4A, S4C, and S4D). In addition, more cells exhibited cleaved Dcp1, an apoptotic marker [47,48], in 30-day oldesgts>HRJDsmidguts (Additional file1: Fig. S4F and S4G), implying that HRJD induction promotes turnover of midgut epithelial cells. Collectively, our data show that post-developmental expression of HRJDs improves stem cell functions in the aged intestine. In this study, we demonstrate that post-developmental expression of planarian HRJD genes in theDrosophilaadult ISCs/EBs can suppress age-related intestinal dysfunctions and extend organismal lifespan, while their continuous expression throughout the entire developmental process hampers regenerative responses and principally shortens lifespan. Notably, HRJDs in adult ISCs/EBs boost the age-related increase of ISC proliferation but do not cause age-related mis-differentiation of ISC progenies (Fig.7). These HRJD-mediated outcomes are distinct from those mediated by typical anti-aging manipulations such as antibiotic treatment and metabolic intervention, which ameliorate both ISC over-proliferation and mis-differentiation [24,31,49]. Therefore, heterologously induced HRJDs create the neomorphic state in the aged intestine (Fig.7). Given the age-related increase of chronic cellular stresses [24,27,36,49,50], we speculate that the HRJD-dependent ISC activation and their proper differentiation improve organismal fitness by enabling active turnover of damaged intestinal cells. Graphical summary. Schematic model for the impact of HRJDs on intestinal homeostasis. In aged wildtype midguts, ISCs over-proliferate, and their daughters fail to differentiate into mature ECs, resulting in an accumulation of mis-differentiated cells (esg+large polyploid). HRJD expression in adult ISCs/EBs further enhances ISC proliferation but suppresses mis-differentiation likely through upregulation of JAK-STAT signaling, which results in successful maintenance of the gut barrier and an extension of organismal lifespan Our investigation implies that the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway underlies the HRJD-mediated enhancement of ISC functions. Surprisingly, however, the expression of most mitogens including upstream ligands of JAK-STAT signaling (upd1,upd2,upd3) were not upregulated by HRJD induction (Additional file1: Fig. S4H), raising the possibility that HRJDs activate STAT by modulating intracellular signaling factors. Such ligand-independent STAT activation can be achieved via non-receptor type tyrosine kinases like Src and Abl [51]. Given that the typical JmjC family proteins function as histone demethylase or protein hydroxylase [52], HRJDs may epigenetically target these tyrosine kinases. Notably,DrosophilaJarid2 (Jumonji, AT rich interactive domain 2) activates EGFR signaling upon overexpression in ISCs/EBs without changing ligand expression [53]. Our findings, together with these reports, suggest a cell-autonomous role of JmjC family proteins in regulating proliferative signaling in stem cell lineages. Intriguingly, Jarid2 expression in ISCs/EBs leads to ISC over-proliferation as well as barrier dysfunction, resulting in reduced lifespan [53], which is the opposite adult phenotype of HRJD expression in ISC lineages. Moreover, in contrast to the nuclear localization of histone demethylase KDM8 [54,55], the closest paralog of HRJDs, ectopically induced HRJDs localize in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus both in vitro (S2 cells) and in vivo (wing discs and adult midguts) (Additional file1: Fig. S1B-S1D). This is a common localization pattern of JmjC-domain only proteins [55,56] and implies that an unknown mechanism may operate when HRJDs work as a potential histone demethylase. In the future, it will thus be critical to examine the detailed molecular function of HRJDs to understand their impact on stem cell lineages. Although HRJDs have been identified as genes conserved between highly regenerative animals [13], it is unclear whether HRJDs alone are sufficient to enhance regenerative responses. Our investigations revealed that ectopic expression of HRJDs failed to improve regeneration of developing wing discs and adult midguts inDrosophila(Figs.2and3), likely through the attenuation of regenerative growth. However, it should be noted that we induced HRJDs before tissue injury and maintained their expression during regeneration period. Given thatHRJDbis upregulated in the late phase of planarian regeneration (3 days after amputation) [13], strict regulation of HRJD induction might be important for their proper function as true regeneration regulators. On the other hand, the expression level ofHRJDaremains constant during planarian regeneration [13], which is recapitulated in our experiments. Another possibility is that a high regeneration ability can be achieved by cooperation between HRJDs and other unidentified genes that have been lost during evolution, which should be addressed in future studies. During the normal aging process in theDrosophilaadult midgut, ISC over-proliferation is closely linked with other aging phenotypes, and suppression of ISC division can prevent the accumulation of mis-differentiated ISC progenies and extend organismal lifespan [24,36,49,50]. In contrast, HRJDs enhance age-related ISC activation but can alleviate mis-differentiation and extend lifespan, suggesting that it is not ISC activation itself but rather mis-differentiation of ISC progenies that principally drives age-related mortality. Consistently, manipulation of mitotic spindle orientation, which affects the cell fate of daughter cells [57,58,59], can extend organismal lifespan without changing mitotic activity of ISCs [59]. Of note, in contrast toDrosophilaISCs which over-proliferate in aged midguts, many adult stem cells decrease their activity and abundance during aging both inDrosophilaand mammals [24,60,61]. Future investigations for mechanisms of HRJD-mediated stem cell rejuvenation will provide clues to develop new anti-aging strategies. In this study, we established aDrosophilamodel in which HRJDs are heterologously expressed in specific tissue or cell type using binary expression systems and demonstrated that HRJDs can improve proliferative/differentiation capacity of ISCs in the aged midgut. Although continuous HRJD expression in the wing disc and in the adult midgut impairs tissue regeneration upon injury, restricted HRJD expression in post-developmental adult ISCs/EBs enhances mitotic activity of ISCs as well as maintains their differentiation fidelity in the aged flies, leading to the prevention of age-related intestinal barrier dysfunction and the extension of organismal lifespan. Our HRJD-expressing model will serve as a valuable resource to understand unprecedented mechanisms of stem cell rejuvenation in the future.

See Additional file2: Table S1 for genotypes in each figure. We used female flies unless otherwise noted in the figures. Experimental crosses that did not involve Gal80ts-mediated inhibition of Gal4 were performed at 25 °C. When using Gal80ts, experimental crosses were maintained at 18 °C. For genetic wing ablation experiments (Fig.2), F1 larvae were raised at 18 °C until day 7, incubated at 29 °C for the next 40 h, and then maintained at 18 °C until the adult hatched or dissection. For lifespan assays, midgut staining, and Smurf assays (Figs.3,4,5, and6), F1 adults were transferred to 29 °C 3 days after eclosion until the experiments. Midgut staining and Smurf assays were performed after 7 or 27 days of 29 °C incubation (young: day 10 adults, old: day 30 adults). For esgFLPout experiments, flies were maintained at 18 °C until 50 days, and 50-day old adults were transferred to 29 °C and analyzed after 10 days (final 60-day old). To express HRJDs using the Gal4/UAS or the QF/QUAS system, we constructed a vector containingHRJDaorHRJDbunder the control of either the UAS sequence or QUAS sequence. Namely, we amplified HRJDa and HRJDb sequence from codon-optimized synthesized DNAs (pUCIDT-HRJDa and pUCIDT-HRJDb, IDT, Additional file3: Supplementary texts S1) forDjHRJDa(Genbank # LC408963) andDjHRJDb(Genbank # LC408964), respectively. UAS-HRJDa and UAS-HRJDb were constructed by ligating HRJDa and HRJDb into pUAST-attB (DGRC 1419), respectively (digested by EcoRI/NotI). Similarly, QUAS-HRJDa and QUAS-HRJDb were constructed by ligating HRJDa and HRJDb into pQUAS-WALIUM20 (DGRC 1474), respectively (digested by NheI/EcoRI). To construct UAS-3xFLAG-HRJDs, we PCR-amplified the coding sequences of HRJDs from pUCIDT-HRJDs by gene-specific primers with 3xFLAG tag at 5′-end of the forward primers, and the amplicons were then ligated into a pUAST-attB vector digested by EcoRI/NotI using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara, 639,649). The landing site for each construct was {3xP3-RFP.attP}ZH-86Fb. Injection and selection were performed by WellGenetics (Taiwan, R.O.C.).

To examine the expression pattern of HRJDs through immunostaining, 1 × 106cells were seeded in 6-well plates containing Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin and were transfected with 800 ng of pAc5-3xFLAG-HRJDs using Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, 301,427) following the manufacturer’s protocol. To prepare pAc5-3xFLAG-HRJDs, we amplified the coding sequences of HRJDs from pUCIDT-HRJDs (Additional file3: Supplementary texts S1) by gene-specific primers with 3xFLAG tag at 5′-end of the forward primers, and the amplicons were then ligated into a pAc5-STABLE2-neo (Addgene, 32,426) [70] digested with EcoRI/XhoI by In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara, 639,649). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and the medium was replaced with fresh Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), blocked in PBST with 5% normal donkey serum (PBSTn), and incubated with primary antibodies in PBSTn overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then washed with PBST, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33,342 suspended in PBSTn and washed again with PBST. Images were captured using an LSM880 (Zeiss). The primary antibody used was a mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1: 2000, Sigma, F1804). The secondary antibodies used were Goat anti-Mouse IgG2b Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor™ 555 (1:2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21147). Hoechst 33,342 (0.4 μM; Invitrogen, H3570) was used for nuclear staining. Images were analyzed and edited using Fiji/ImageJ software (NIH). To examine the expression of HRJDs, 2.5 × 105cells were seeded in 24-well plates containing Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin and were transfected with 200 ng of pAc5-3xFLAG-HRJDs using Effectene Transfection Reagent (QIAGEN, 301,427) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, and the medium was replaced with fresh Schneider’sDrosophilamedium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 50 μL RIPA buffer supplemented with cOmplete ULTRA EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 05892953001). The lysate was sonicated and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. The supernatant was mixed with SDS, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to western blotting. Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P PVDF membranes (Millipore, IPVH00010) for immunoblotting. Membranes were blocked with 4% skimmed milk diluted in 1 × Tris buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20. Immunoblotting was performed using the below-mentioned antibodies, which were diluted with 4% skim milk. The signals were visualized using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, WBKLS0500) and FUSION SOLO. 7S. EDGE (Vilber-Lourmat). Contrast and brightness adjustments were applied using the Fiji/ImageJ software (NIH). The primary antibody used was mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1: 5000, Sigma, F1804). Mouse anti-alpha tubulin (DM1A) monoclonal antibody (1: 5000, Sigma, T9026) was used as loading control. The secondary antibody used was HRP-conjugated goat/rabbit/donkey anti-mouse IgG (1: 10,000, Promega, W402B). 5 mM paraquat (Sigma, 856,177) and 5% (w/v) DSS (MP Biomedicals, 160,110) were dissolved in 5% (w/v) sucrose solution. Filter paper (Whatman 3MM) was soaked with 400 μL of these reagents and placed into empty vials. For histological analyses, flies were fed with the reagent solution for 1 day. For the survival assay, flies were transferred to new vials and dead flies (determined by immobility and showing no response to tapping) were counted every day. 5% sucrose was used for control feeding. Samples were dissected in 1 × PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min (wing discs) and 30–45 min (adult midgut) at room temperature (RT), respectively. The following primary antibodies were used with indicated dilution into 1 × PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100: rabbit anti-PH3 (Millipore 06–570, 1:1000), mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma F1804, 1:1000), mouse anti-Dlg (DSHB 4F3, 1:100), rabbit anti-GFP (MBL 598, 1:500), rat anti-GFP (Nacalai tesque 04404–26, 1:400), rabbit anti-Tsp2A (Izumi et al., 2016, 1:1000) [71], rabbit anti-Mesh (Izumi et al., 2012, 1:1000) [72], rabbit anti-Ssk (Izumi et al., 2016, 1:1000) [71], chicken anti-β-galactosidase (Abcam ab9361, 1:500), anti-cDcp1 (Cell Signaling Technology 9578, 1:200). After overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C, samples were incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch and Invitrogen, 1:500) for 1 h at RT. Hoechst 33,342 (Invitrogen, final concentration: 10 μg/ml) was used to visualize DNA. Wing discs were mounted as described previously [73,74]. Samples were mounted in Slowfade Diamond (ThermoFisher, S36963) and imaged with confocal microscopy Zeiss LSM880 or Zeiss LSM980. We referred to Rera et al. (2012) for the Smurf assay conditions [35]. To prepare the feeding medium, 100 μL of 50% (w/v) brilliant blue FCF (Wako, 027–12842, final 2.5%) and 100 μL of 5% (w/v) sucrose were added to a vial containing 2 ml of cornmeal-agar food. After mixing with a spatula, a Whatman 1 filter (1001–020) was put on the feeding medium. Flies were fed with this medium at 25 °C for 1 day, after which they were transferred to a new vial containing cornmeal-agar food without blue dye to clean the epidermis. Two hours after the transfer, Smurf phenotype was checked. We classified the Smurf phenotype as blue dye leakage outside abdomen (thorax, head, legs). Total RNA was purified from 10 to 15 midguts using the ReliaPrep RNA Tissue Miniprep System (Promega). cDNA was made from 100 or 200 ng of RNA using PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa). Quantitative PCR was performed using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) and the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher). RpL32 was used as an internal control. Primer sequences are listed in Additional file4: Table S2. We created the phylogenetic tree of representative organisms using the NCBI taxonomy browser (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi). The species examined areAmphimedon queenslandica(Porifera),Mnemiopsis leidyi(Ctenophora),Trichoplax adhaerens(Placozoa),Hydra vulgaris(Cnidaria),Ptychodera flava(Hemichordata),Acanthaster planci(Echinodermata),Branchiostoma floridae(Cephalochordata),Ciona intestinalis(Tunicata),Danio rerio(Teleostei),Homo sapiens,Mus musculus(Mammalia),Schmidtea mediterranea(Platyhelminthes),Caenorhabditis elegans(Nematoda), andDrosophila melanogaster(Arthropoda). These species, except forD. rerio,H. sapiens,M. musculus,C. elegans, andD. melanogaster, are known to have HRJDs and exhibit high regeneration ability [13]. The pictures were downloaded from PhyloPic, and the color of some were changed from black to blue. Credits: Bennet McComish (B. floridae), Malio Kodis (M. leidyi), and Markus A. Grohme (S. mediterranea,https://www.phylopic.org/images/93f9611c-0cbd-4a14-92da-004a4521e21f/schmidtea-mediterranea). For wing discs, we counted PH3 positive cells in the pouch region, which develops into the adult wing. After binarization, the number of PH3 positive cells was counted using the Analyze Particles function in Fiji/ImageJ and subsequently confirmed or corrected by visual review of the images. For adult midguts, the number of PH3 positive cells in the posterior midguts was manually counted. To quantify junctional and cytoplasmic intensity, a line that was orthogonal to one side of a cell was drawn, and then the plot profile was calculated for the line. We defined the junctional intensity as the highest value in that profile and defined cytoplasmic intensity as the value 20 pixels (~ 2.6 μm) away from the highest value. Three lines were drawn for one cell and the average of the three was used to represent the junctional/cytoplasmic ratio for the cell. Six polyploid cells were randomly selected from each image for quantification. The signal intensity ofpuc-lacZand10×STAT-GFPreporters was quantified using Fiji/ImageJ. The nuclei of large polyploid cells (forpuc-lacZ) and Pros−diploid cells (for10×STAT-GFP) were selected as ROIs using the polygon selection tool. The reporter intensity in each ROI was quantified using the Measure command. Nuclei ofesg-Gal4>UAS-GFPpositive cells were traced by the polygon selection tool and added as ROI in Fiji/ImageJ. The size of each ROI was quantified using the Measure command. Cell number was quantified using Fiji/ImageJ. To count the total cell number, Hoechst signal was processed as following: (1) despeckle, (2) binarization, (3) fill hole, (4) watershed, (5) analyze particle. The following cell number was manually counted using the cell counter function:esg>GFP+cells,Dl-lacZ+cells, Pros+cells, and cDcp1+cells. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel and RStudio. Two tailedttests were used for comparisons between two groups. One-way ANOVAs with post hoc Tukey tests were performed when comparing three or more groups. Log-rank tests were used for comparison of survival curve. Significance is indicated in the figures as follows: *P≤ 0.05, **P≤ 0.01, ***P≤ 0.001, not significant (N.S.):P> 0.05. Bar graphs show mean ± standard error. Boxplots show median (thick line in the box), first and third quartiles (bottom and top of the box), minimum value (lower whisker), and maximum value (upper whisker). Dots in bar graphs and boxplots indicate individual values. Violin plots portray the distribution of individual values.

They found the transferred gene suppressed an age-related intestinal issue in the flies. Their results suggest studying genes specific to animals with high regenerative capability may uncover new mechanisms for rejuvenating stem cell function and extending the healthy lifespan of unrelated organisms.
Do you want to live forever? Some do, some don’t. But we all want to live healthily for however long we have, and a big part of medical research is about this aspect of longevity. One idea, which might sound a little like science fiction, is to upgrade the human body in such a way that it can regenerate itself when injured, diseased, or when aging starts taking its toll, a bit like the superhero character Wolverine from the popular comic book and film seriesX-Men. Of course, we’re nowhere near that stage yet, but progress is being made in the world of regenerative medicine, albeit the test subjects are just flies for now.
“In animals capable of whole-body regeneration, such as flatworms and jellyfish, specific genes may help allow regeneration and maintain long-term stem cell functions. Conversely, mammals and insects, which have limited regenerative abilities, may have lost these genes during evolution,” said Associate Professor Yuichiro Nakajima. “It is unclear whether reintroducing these regeneration-associated genes in low regenerative animals could affect their regeneration and aging processes. In our recent study, we focused on the group of genes unique to animals with high regenerative capacity, named highly regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs), and transferred them into the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster, to test their effects.”
Nakajima’s team hoped upgraded fruit flies would regenerate tissue if injured, which didn’t happen. However, Hiroki Nagai, an expert in fruit fly intestines, noticed something else.
“Nagai discovered some novel phenotypes, characteristics that manifest from genes in a given set of conditions,” said Nakajima. “HRJDs promoted greater intestinal stem cell division, whilst also suppressing intestinal cells that were mis-differentiating, or going wrong in aged flies. This is in contrast to the use of antibiotics, for example, which might suppress mis-differentiated intestinal cells, but also suppress intestinal stem cell division. For this reason, HRJDs had a measurable effect on the lifespans of fruit flies, which opens the door, or at least provides clues, for the development of new anti-aging strategies. After all, human and insect intestines have surprisingly much in common on a cellular level.”
Finding this out was not without difficulties, however. Though fruit flies are famous test subjects for biological research, given their relatively short lives and fast rates of reproduction and maturation, their aging process still takes around two months, which affected the experimental schedules for Nakajima’s team, who were also busy with other things. Now that they have reached a striking conclusion, though, there is still much work to be done.
“Details of the molecular workings of HRJDs are still unresolved. And it’s unclear whether they work alone or in combination with some other component,” said Nakajima. “Therefore, this is just the start of the journey, but we know now that our modified fruit flies can serve as a valuable resource to uncover unprecedented mechanisms of stem cell rejuvenation in the future. In humans, intestinal stem cells decrease in activity with age, so this research is a promising avenue for stem cell-based therapies.”

Transient structure in fly leg holds clue to insect shape formation,"You have full access to thisopen accessarticle 1318Accesses 58Altmetric 7Mentions Explore all metrics Organisms display a remarkable diversity in their shapes. Although substantial progress has been made in unraveling the mechanisms that govern cell fate determination during development, the mechanisms by which fate-determined cells give rise to the final shapes of organisms remain largely unknown. This study describes in detail the process of the final shape formation of the tarsus, which is near the distal tip of the adult leg, during the pupal stage inDrosophila melanogaster. Days-long live imaging revealed unexpectedly complicated cellular dynamics. The epithelial cells transiently form the intriguing structure, which we named the Parthenon-like structure. The basal surface of the epithelial cells and localization of the basement membrane protein initially show a mesh-like structure and rapidly shrink into the membranous structure during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure. Furthermore, macrophage-like cells are observed moving around actively in the Parthenon-like structure and engulfing epithelial cells. The findings in this research are expected to significantly contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms involved in shaping the final structure of the adult tarsus. Avoid common mistakes on your manuscript. Organisms exhibit a tremendous variety in their shapes. Understanding the mechanisms forming the various organismal shapes has been one of the important subjects in biology. Over the past several decades, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms that determine cell fate during development. This has led us to understand that the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination are conserved among closely related species. In contrast to the mechanisms of fate determination, how fate-determined cells form final shapes remains elusive. Since shapes can differ dramatically between closely related species that are expected to share the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination, differences in final shape formation processes should greatly contribute to making the shape differences. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of final shape formation is of great importance to understand the mechanisms of formation and diversification of organismal shapes. Insects account for more than half of living species and show extreme diversity in their shapes (Snodgrass1935; Grimaldi and Engel2005). This makes insects attract the attention of many researchers. Insect legs have also evolved into various shapes to adapt to various environments. Generally, they consist of several segments, which are the coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus, and pretarsus, in a proximal to distal direction. Among these segments, the tarsus, located near the tip of the leg, is unique in that it is further subdivided into several segments called tarsal segments or tarsomeres. The number of tarsal segments varies between species and ranges from one to five. Even within the same individual, it sometimes varies depending on the developmental stage and on the body segments in which the leg is formed (Angelini et al.2012). In addition to the number of tarsal segments, the shapes of tarsal segments are also variable. For example, the tarsus of the first leg in the male diving beetle is flat and expanded, making a fan-shaped sucking disc, while that in mosquitos is very long and slender (Kojima2017). This morphological diversity makes the insect tarsus a good model for studying the mechanisms of final shape formation and its diversification. In the adult leg ofDrosophila melanogaster, the tarsus consists of five segments, the tarsal segments 1–5, from proximal to distal direction. The adult leg develops from the leg disc, which is a mono-layered epithelial sheet formed during embryogenesis. During the larval stage, the leg disc becomes a sack-like structure, part of which forms the disc proper that differentiates into the adult leg, while the other part becomes the peripodial membrane that covers the disc proper. With the growth of the leg disc, the disc proper is subdivided into concentric regions corresponding to the adult leg segments through the exquisite regulatory interaction of patterning genes. (reviewed in Kojima2004,2017; Estella et al.2012; Ruiz-Losada et al.2018) Accordingly, the most central part corresponds to the most distal segment (pretarsus), and the most peripheral part corresponds to the most proximal segment (coxa). Cells that develop into each tarsal segment are determined by the end of the late third instar. During these processes, the leg disc is folded and remains covered by the peripodial membrane. After the third instar, the larval cuticle changes to form the puparium, within which pupal development proceeds for about 4 days. Immediately after the puparium is formed, imaginal discs begin to join together and form the adult body. By 12 h after puparium formation (APF), the pupal cuticle is formed and encloses the developing adult tissue. During these processes, the leg disc everts and elongates with the breakage and retraction of the peripodial membrane (Proag et al.2019). Around the puparium formation, each tarsal segment is already recognizable morphologically by the epithelial folding or constriction between tarsal segments. The development of the tarsus by this stage has been extensively studied (reviewed in Kojima2004,2017; Ruiz-Losada et al.2018). Regions corresponding to individual tarsal segments are determined by the region-specific expression of genes encoding transcription factors and their regulatory interactions (Kojima et al.2000; Kozu et al.2006; Tajiri et al.2007; Pueyo and Couso2008; Greenberg and Hatini2009; Natori et al.2012). This leads to the activation of Notch signaling in the distal end of each tarsal segment through regulation of the expression of Notch ligands, Delta, and Serrate, just proximal to the Notch active region in each tarsal segment (de Celis et al.1998; Bishop et al.1999; Rauskolb and Irvine1999; Rauskolb2001; Córdoba et al.2016). This Notch activation induces the region-specific regulation of the cytoskeleton and cell death, resulting in the formation of constrictions between tarsal segments (Córdoba and Estella2014,2018; de Madrid et al.2015; Monier et al.2015). Recently, the involvement of the tissue-wide mechanical force generated by cell proliferation has also been suggested to contribute to the formation of constrictions in concert with the Notch signaling pathway (Rodríguez et al.2024). After the early events described above, the process of forming the final shape of the adult leg continues to progress through the subsequent pupal stage, which lasts another 3.5 days or more, but much of its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Although several aspects of the shape-making process, such as changes in the external shape and formation of joints and pulvilli, have been previously reported (Mirth and Akam2002; Mirth2005; Tajiri et al.2010,2011; Kimura et al.2020), it is still unknown how individual cells continuously change their shape to form the final shape of the adult tarsus. In this paper, our results of long-term live imaging, in which tarsal morphogenesis during the pupal stage is continuously observed, are described. We found unexpected and dramatic shape changes in epithelial cells and the basement membrane, as well as interesting behavior of macrophage-like cells. The results presented here will greatly contribute to elucidating the mechanism of the final shape formation of the adult tarsus. Flies were raised on a standard cornmeal/agar/yeast medium at 25 °C unless stated otherwise. The fly strains used were the following:His2Av-mRFPIII.1andHis2Av-mRFPII.1(Pandey et al.2005),Jupiter-GFPG00147(Morin et al.2001),sGMCA3.1(Kiehart et al.2000),sqh-GFPC-42(Royou et al.2004),Ubi-GFP-CAAXZH-22A(Kondo and Hyashi2013),Ubi-TagRFP-T-CAAX, LanB1-GFPfTRG00681.sfGFP-TVPTBF(Sarov et al.2016), UAS-Apoliner(Bardet et al.2008), UAS-GFP.S65T, UAS-GFPnls, UAS-TagBFP9D, UAS-Kaede(Ando et al.2002),Ay-GAL4 (Ito et al.1997),Dll-GAL4em212(Gorfinkiel et al.1997),He-GAL4 (Zettervall et al.2004),neur-GAL4A101(Jhaveri et al.2000),srpHemo-GAL4 (Brückner et al.2004), andhsp70-FLP. Further details on fly strains are found in Flybase (http://flybase.org). Genotypes of flies used for each figure and movie are shown in TableS1. For live imaging after 12 h APF (i.e., Stage III onwards), the puparium was completely removed. The pupa covered only by the pupal cuticle was mounted with the ventral side down on the bottom of a glass-bottom dish. This allowed us to observe the tarsi of the first and second legs from their lateral sides since they are oriented laterally so that their lateral sides face toward the outside of the pupa. We essentially observed the tarsus of the first leg. A small amount of water or silicon oil (Olympus) was put between the glass-bottom and the pupa. Silicon grease (Shin-Etsu Silicone) was placed around the pupa, on which a cover glass was placed. In this preparation, we succeeded in keeping flies alive until the end of the pupal stage. Z stack images were acquired at regular time intervals. In Stage II (before 12 h APF), the puparium cannot be removed without affecting development due to the incomplete formation of the pupal cuticle or its tight association with the puparium. In addition, the tissue movement is very rapid. Therefore, the pupa without its puparium removed was set up as described above for live imaging, and we collected images of a singleXYplane corresponding to the longitudinal section every 2 min. All live imaging observations were performed using the inverted confocal microscope, FV3000 (Olympus) at room temperature (not strict but near 25 °C). Images were analyzed by ImageJ (https://fiji.sc/), Imaris (Oxford Instruments), and cellSens (Olympus). White pupae of flies carryinghsp70-FLP,Ay-GAL4, and UAS-GFP.S65Twere collected into a new culture vial and heat shocked by soaking the culture vial in a water bath incubator for 30 min at 37 °C. After heat shock, the flies were allowed to develop at 25 °C. Z stack images were obtained between 18 h APF and 19.5 h APF as described above. The number of protrusions in each cell was counted manually. Pupae carryingDll-GAL4em212and UAS-Kaedewere mounted as described above at 17 h APF. Prior to live imaging, the 405-nm laser was irradiated to cells at nearly constant intervals for 5 s. In all irradiations, green signals of Kaede were immediately photoconverted to red signals. Then, live imaging was started from 18 h APF as described above. For observation ofHe>GFPnls, pupal legs of flies carryingHe-GAL4 and UAS-GFPnlswere dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, it was fixed in PBS containing 4% Paraformaldehyde for 1.5 h in room temperature and washed in PBS containing 0.01% Saponin (PBSS). After that, they were stained in PBSS containing 0.25% 4′,6-Diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (SIGMA) and 0.5~0.75% Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 3 h. Stained samples were washed in PBSS and mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Labs). Images were obtained by FV1000 (Olympus). Observations of srpHemo>GFPflies were carried out in the same way as other live imaging experiments. To observe tarsal development during the pupal stage in detail, we took advantage of long-term live imaging. How the final shape of the tarsus is formed through very dynamic changes at both tissue and cellular levels was successfully traced. Together with earlier observations, we divide the entire process into the following five stages for convenience (Fig.1). The overview of the final shape formation ofDrosophilaadult tarsus during the pupal stage. We divided the entire process into five stages based on the morphological changes at both tissue and cellular levels observed in long-term live imaging experiments. Representative photos or surface-rendered images (sGMCA signal) corresponding to several time points are shown on the left side. See also Supplemental MoviesS1,S3 Just after puparium formation (APF), the leg disc partially elongates and evaginates from the center, making each tarsal segment recognizable morphologically. This process has been reported to be controlled by cell shape changes, cell rearrangements, and the interaction between the disc epithelium and peripodial epithelium (Condic et al.1991; Proag et al.2019). As this process has been described in detail previously, we do not get into it in this paper. After the eversion of the leg disc, the elongation of the tarsus further proceeds by unfolding of the morphologically distinctive tarsal segments. By 15 h APF, the tarsus fully elongates, with the tarsal segments no longer visible morphologically, forming a bloated tube with a large lumen diameter. Both the length and diameter of the tarsus reach their maxima. The latter is more than three times the diameter of the adult tarsus (Fig.S1B). The pupal cuticle is formed at least by the end of this stage. The tarsus decreases its diameter dramatically (Fig.S1B). During this change, indentations between tarsal segments reappear and deepen, making segmental structures visible again. Moreover, some bristles start to sprout by the end of this stage. The name of this stage comes from an interesting structure of the epithelial cells seen in this stage, which we named the Parthenon-like structure. Its details are described later. The indentation between tarsal segments deepens further, and the joint formation between tarsal segments proceeds. Bristles fully elongate, and their formation is nearly completed. Furthermore, the formation of pretarsal structures, such as claws and pulvilli occurs mainly in this stage. By about 50 h APF, the formation of the external shapes of the adult leg is almost complete. Seen from the outside, the shape of the leg hardly changes during this stage. However, we discovered that the thickness of the epithelial cell layer continues to reduce gradually. Thus, we separated this stage from Stage IV as an independent stage. Hereafter, we describe the details of cell dynamics in each of the above stages except Stage I. In Stage II, the tarsus elongates to its maximum length along the proximodistal direction to form a broad and straight tubular structure. Live imaging was performed without removing the puparium in Stage II since it is difficult to remove the puparium without causing developmental defects before 12 h APF. In this condition, the depth of the focus at which clear images could be obtained was limited. In addition to this limitation, the tissue elongates so quickly that taking images as a Z series was also difficult. Accordingly, we acquired images of a singleXYplane corresponding to the longitudinal section every 2 min. We used flies expressing GFP-CAAX (labeling the plasma membrane) and His2Av-mRFP (labeling the nuclei). At the beginning of the live imaging, 7 h APF, the everted tarsus was slightly elongated but the folding of each tarsal segment was still visible (Fig.S2A, Supplemental MovieS2). From around 9 h APF, the elongation of the tarsus was accelerated with the rapid unfolding of each tarsal segment. By 11 h APF, the folding disappeared almost completely, and the tarsus had become a bloated, straight epithelial tube (Fig.S2B–E). During this process, epithelial cells initially long in the apicobasal direction became cuboidal in shape. Interestingly, a cluster of large cells was observed coming from the proximal side and spreading distally in the lumen of the elongating tarsus (Fig.S2B–E, Supplemental MovieS2). After this stage onwards, they were always observed in the tarsus (see below). Since these large cells expressed hemocyte-specific GAL4, such asHe-GAL4 orsrpHemo-GAL4, they appeared to be hemocytes (Fig.S3), presumably macrophage-like cells according to their morphology and behavior (see below). From this stage onwards, the pupa becomes resilient to having its puparium removed and can develop into the adult after the complete removal of the puparium. The developing pupa without the puparium is only covered by the transparent pupal cuticle, which allows us to acquire clear images at relatively deeper focuses. Additionally, from Stage III onwards, changes in overall shape are no longer as rapid as in Stage II. Accordingly, we could collect Z series images at each time point during long-term live imaging experiments from Stage III (Supplemental MovieS1,S3). This long-term live imaging experiment allowed us to analyze detailed cellular behaviors. As mentioned above, the overall diameter of the tarsus decreases dramatically in Stage III. We observed that surprisingly dynamic changes in cell morphology occur inside during this process. Around 18 h APF, epithelial cells deformed their shapes and temporarily formed an interesting structure. We named it the Parthenon-like structure because it reminded us of the Parthenon, an ancient Greek ruin. Details of the Parthenon-like structure and associated cellular dynamics are described in the following three subsections. Firstly, flies expressing His2Av-mRFP (labeling the nuclei) and sGMCA (labeling actin) were observed, and Z series images were obtained every 15 min (Fig.2, Supplemental MoviesS1,S3). By reconstructing a 3D structure using a part of these images obtained at 18 h APF, we found a very curious architecture of the epithelial cell layer (Fig.3A). Nuclei and most volumes of sGMCA signals were aligned as a monolayer on the apical (outer) side. At the basal (inner) side, sGMCA signals spread planarly, creating a thin layer. Between these two layers, pillar-like sGMCA signals were seen connecting them. There appeared to be open spaces or cavities between the pillars. Since sGMCA labels actin, it could be possible that epithelial cells are tightly lined up without space between them as usual and that it is the cytoskeleton forming the curious structure. However, similar structures were also observed in flies expressing plain GFP (labeling cytosol) under the control ofDistal-less(Dll)-GAL4 (Dll>GFP) (Fig.S4A) and GFP-CAAX (labeling cell membrane) (see Fig.3D–F).Thus, we concluded that epithelial cells themselves form this remarkable structure by deformation; that is, epithelial cells tightly align most of their cell body containing nuclei at the apical side, protrude cytoplasm as a pillar-like process in a basal direction, and then spread at the basal side, making cavities within the epithelial cell layer. As mentioned above, we named this structure the Parthenon-like structure after the ancient Greek ruin. We also observed the Parthenon-like structure in flies expressing Jupiter-GFP (labeling microtubule) and Sqh-GFP (labeling Myo II) (Fig.S4B, C). Thus, cytoskeletal molecules, such as actin, microtubule, and Myo II, appear to be assembled in cables inside the pillars. Within the Parthenon-like structure, several clusters of cells whose cell bodies and nuclei fell into cavities were observed (surrounded by a dashed line in Fig.3A). The time-lapse observations until later stages and labeling of sensory cells by TagBFP driven byneuralized(neur)-GAL4, which is specifically expressed in the sensory cells, indicate that these cells are sensory organ cells (Fig.S4D–D”). Interestingly, we found that macrophage-like cells frequently existed and were actively moving around in the cavities between pillars (arrow in Fig.3A). Their detailed behavior is described later.

Scale bar inD, 5 μm forD–F To reveal whether the pillar-like structures are contributed by all the epidermal cells or only a part of them, we carried out the mosaic analysis by the flip-out technique using flies havinghsp70-FLP, UAS-GFP, andAy-GAL4 (Golic and Lindquist1989; Ito et al.1997), in which small patches of epithelial cells were labeled by GFP (Fig.3B). The reconstructed image of the representative cluster of four epithelial cells is shown in Fig.3B’ and Supplemental MovieS4. The leftmost cell had one protrusion while the next one on the right had two. Moreover, the right protrusion of the second cell looked to be making a bundle with a protrusion from the adjacent third cell on the right of the second cell (open arrow in Fig.3B’, Supplemental MovieS4). When counting how many protrusions each cell extended, we found that, in 18 h APF, all epithelial cells extended one or two protrusions (Fig.3C; only one protrusion in about two-thirds of the epithelial cells and two in about one-third). These results indicate that all epithelial cells contribute to the pillars of the Parthenon-like structure and that each pillar is made up of protrusions derived from multiple adjacent cells. As shown above, the shape of epithelial cells was cuboidal at the end of Stage II (Fig.S2E, Supplemental MovieS2). These cuboidal epithelial cells started to form rapidly the Parthenon-like structure with the onset of Stage III (Fig.2A’, B’). The thickness of the epithelial cell layer rapidly increased with the elongation of the pillars of the Parthenon-like structure (Fig.S1C). Once the epithelial thickness reached its maximum, the Parthenon-like structure turned to be resolved rapidly by the shortening of the pillars and disappearance of the cavities (Fig.2C’, D’), resulting in the decrease of the epithelial thickness (Fig.S1C). During the above process, the lumen diameter and overall diameter of the tarsus also reduced dramatically (Fig.S1B), implying a close relationship between the formation/disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure and the reduction of the tarsus diameter. The disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure progressed faster in the future joint region than in the inter-joint region, resulting in the invagination of the apical surface (see arrowheads in Supplemental MovieS3). This allowed the morphological distinction of tarsal segments again. To reveal details in the Parthenon-like structure formation, Z stack images were obtained every 5 min using flies expressing GFP-CAAX and His2Av-mRFP (Fig.3D–F, Supplemental MovieS5). Before the formation of the Parthenon-like structure initiated, cuboidal epithelial cells were aligned as a monolayer (Fig.3D). In around 16 h APF, at the very beginning of the formation of the Parthenon-like structure, a part of the cytoplasm of epithelial cells protruded basally, while connections between neighboring cells at the basal surface looked to be maintained, resulting in the formation of triangular-shaped cavities (Fig.3E, F, asterisks). In addition, relatively strong signals of GFP-CAAX were observed in the area where the pillars were being formed (Fig.3D. E arrowheads). The protrusions then elongated basally to form the pillars (Fig.3F). As the lumen diameter dramatically reduced during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure, we thought that some structural changes in the basal part of the Parthenon-like structure must occur during this process. Thus, we focused on the structure and behavior of the basal surface of epithelial cells. To know its detailed structure, we observed the focal planes including only the basal surface of GFP-expressing epithelial cells (the floor of the Parthenon-like structure) inDll>GFPflies (Fig.4A–C’). Surprisingly, in 16.5 h APF, the basal surface of epithelial cells showed a mesh-like pattern and had many holes (Fig.4B’). The live imaging showed these holes rapidly shrank and almost disappeared within 2 h, as the overall diameter of the tarsus reduced (Fig4B’, C’, Supplemental MovieS6). To reveal how each epithelial cell comprises the basal meshwork, we carefully analyzed clusters of epithelial cells expressing GFP inAy>GFPflies. Observation of 3D-reconstructed images of clusters showed that filopodia-like thin protrusions were elongated from the roots of the pillars (Fig.4D, Supplemental MovieS7). According to this observation, we hypothesized that such filopodia-like protrusions connect to each other to form the basal meshwork as shown in the illustration in Fig.4E.

To investigate the structure of the basement membrane during the shrinkage of the basal meshwork of epithelial cells, we examined the basement membrane structure using flies expressing Laminin B1-GFP (LanB1-GFP) and RFP-CAAX (Fig.4F–H, Supplemental MovieS8). LanB1 is a major component of the basement membrane. LanB1-GFP signals coincided with the basal surface of epithelial cells, as shown by the comparison between LanB1-GFP and RFP-CAAX signals (Fig.4F–F”). The basement membrane also showed the mesh-like structure at the initiation of the Parthenon-like structure formation (Fig.4G). The meshwork of LanB1-GFP signals also shrank, becoming uniform and membranous signals, as is generally seen (Fig.4H). These observations indicate that the basement membrane structure also changed dramatically during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure. In addition to the meshwork to membranous change in the basal surface of the Parthenon-like structure, we found another interesting behavior of it. As shown in Fig.5A, the basal surface of epithelial cells was winding along the proximodistal axis immediately after the Parthenon-like structure started to form, possibly because the progression of the pillar elongation varies from place to place along the proximodistal axis. However, it progressively flattened along with the shrinkage of the basal meshwork (Fig.5B, C). In 19.5 h APF, the basal surface of epithelial cells was very straight and taut (Fig.5D). These observations imply increasing tension on the basal surface in the proximodistal direction. We further obtained interesting data related to the proximodistal tension by utilizing the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede, which converts the color from green to red in response to UV irradiation (Ando et al.2002). We irradiated epithelial cells positioned at roughly regular intervals with UV light and then, observed the tarsus by live imaging (Fig.5E–G”, Supplemental MovieS9). Since the tarsus is a three-dimensional structure, and epithelial cells are arranged three-dimensionally, it was difficult to irradiate only one target cell. Instead, several neighboring cells were labeled simultaneously in each of the UV-irradiated loci. In 18 h APF, pillars of the Parthenon-like structure appeared to be tilted relative to the apicobasal axis, with the basal side more distal than the apical side (Fig.5E–E”). Interestingly, live imaging showed that the basal side then moved significantly toward the proximal direction (Fig.5F–F”, Supplemental MovieS9). By 24 h APF, the tilting direction of the pillars was reversed, so that the basal side was more proximal than the apical side (Fig.5G–G”). These observations also imply that there is a tension that pulls the basal part of the Parthenon-like structure proximally.

The details of the pulvilli formation have been described previously by Kimura et al. (2020). From this stage onwards, the difference between the dorsal and ventral sides of the tarsus became apparent. The thickness of the epithelial cell layer became much thinner on the ventral side than on the dorsal side (Fig.S1C). The ventral epithelial cell layer was straight, whereas the dorsal epithelial cell layer was somewhat arched (Fig.6A–B’). Furthermore, the formation of the ball-and-socket structure of the joint was started on the dorsal side but not on the ventral side (Fig.6B–C’). On the dorsal side, invagination of the joint region became deepened with a greater reduction of the luminal diameter at the joint region than in the inter-joint region, making a deep cleft between neighboring tarsal segments (Fig.6A, A’, Supplemental MovieS3). After the cleft reached its deepest at around 40 h APF, the bottom of the cleft moved proximally (Fig.6B, B’, Supplemental MovieS3,S10), and then, the ball-and-socket structure formation of the joint proceeded during the early Stage V (Fig.6C’, D’, Supplemental MovieS3,S10). This process has previously been described in detail by Tajiri et al. (2010). The arched dorsal epithelial cell layer seemed to result from the deep invagination at the joint region. In Stage IV, the overall diameter of each segment was slightly reduced but not so much as in Stage III (Fig.S1B).

Dashed rectangles inA, B, C,Dare magnified inA’,B’,C’,D’, respectively. By the end of Stage IV (A–B’), the external shape formation, such as elongation of bristles, claws, and pulvilli are almost complete. The bottom of the invaginated joint moved proximally, and then, the ball-and-socket structure formation progressed in Stage V. The morphological difference between the dorsal and ventral epithelium became apparent (double arrows and open double arrows inB’,C’,D’). In Stage V (C–D’), the epithelial layer decreased its thickness without hardly changing the outline of segments. See also Supplemental MovieS10. Dorsal is to the top and distal to the right in all figures. Scale bars inA, 50 μm forA, B, C,D, inA’, 20 μm forA’,B’,C’,D’ Even after the completion of the external shape by the end of Stage IV, changes in the epithelial cell layer continued inside. The epithelial cell layer decreased its thickness without hardly changing the outline of segments. During this process, the basal surface of the epithelial cell layer was getting closer to the apical surface (Fig.6C–D’, Supplemental MovieS10). As shown above, we observed that macrophage-like cells were getting into the lumen of the expanding tarsus from the proximal end in Stage II (see Fig.S2, Supplemental MovieS2) and resided in the cavity of the Parthenon-like structure, where they were actively moving around, in Stage III (see Fig.3and Supplemental MovieS3). Fascinatingly, by obtaining Z stack images every 22 s, we succeeded in capturing the moment when a macrophage-like cell in the Parthenon-like structure phagocytoses an epithelial cell (Fig.7A–E, Supplemental MovieS11). A macrophage-like cell (arrow in Fig.7A–E) in the cavity of the Parthenon-like structure extended filopodia apically and phagocytosed an epithelial cell whose cell body containing the nucleus was extruded basally (arrowheads in Fig.7A–E). To confirm that cells phagocytosed by macrophage-like cells were apoptotic cells, we observed the caspase activity in epithelial cells by expressing Apoliner under the control ofDll-GAL4 (Dll>Apoliner). Apoliner is a caspase activity reporter, in which mRFP with a transmembrane domain is connected to EGFP with nuclear localization signal (NLS-EGFP) by a linker containing the target site cleaved by caspases. Without caspase activity, both mRFP and EGFP are colocalized on the cell membrane, while NLS-EGFP is released from the membrane-attached mRFP and gets into the nucleus in response to caspase activity (Bardet et al.2008). Since we usedDll-GAL4 to drive Apoliner expression, it was expressed only in epithelial cells but not in macrophage-like cells. However, we could see a macrophage-like cell as a cluster of relatively large dots of mRFP signals (Fig.7H–N) probably due to the accumulation of mRFP derived from engulfed epithelial cells, as mentioned in the original report (Bardet et al.2008). This helped us to find macrophage-like cells inDll>Apolinerflies. Through live imaging, we observed that one epithelial cell, which initially located its cell body at the apical side without the nuclear EGFP signal, began to show the EGFP signal in its nucleus (Fig.7F, G), and then, its cell body migrated in a basal direction (Fig.7H), finally reaching a macrophage-like cell detected as a cluster of mRFP signals (Fig.7H, see also Supplemental MovieS12). Macrophage-like cells with multiple EGFP signals were often observed (Fig.7I, I’). These signals appeared to reflect EGFP signals in nuclei of engulfed epithelial cells. In addition, we also successively observed a macrophage-like cell passing through the basal surface of the Parthenon-like structure (Fig.7J–N, Supplemental MovieS13). Taken together, it appears that macrophage-like cells move in and out of the cavities of the Parthenon-like structure, and when entering the cavity, they phagocytose epithelial cells initiating apoptosis.

Scale bars inA, 5 μm forA–E, inF, 10 μm forF–I’, inJ, 10 μm forJ–N Taking advantage of long-term live imaging, we could reveal nearly the whole shaping process of the adult tarsus during the pupal stage inDrosophila. Changes in the shape of cells and the tissue as a composite of cells were more dramatic and complex than previously thought. Epithelial cells change their shape from columnar to cuboidal during the elongation of the tarsus in Stage II (see Fig.S2and Supplemental MovieS2). Then, the cuboidal epithelial cells further change their shape dramatically to form the unexpected structure, the Parthenon-like structure, in Stage III (see Fig.3and Supplemental MovieS5). The Parthenon-like structure is a transient structure, and the rapid reduction in the tarsal diameter occurs during the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure (see Fig.S1B and Supplemental MovieS3). After the tarsal diameter becomes that of the adult leg at the end of Stage III, the thickness of the epithelial cell layer continues to reduce in Stage IV and Stage V (see Fig.S1C, Fig.6and Supplemental MovieS10). Especially in Stage V, although the external shape is completed, the thinning of the epithelial cell layer further continues internally. In addition, we could also document the behavior of macrophage-like cells (see Fig.7and Supplemental MovieS11-13). The possible mechanisms and roles of these cellular dynamics are discussed below. In Stage II, the everted tarsus fully elongates to its maximum length. The invasion of macrophage-like cells from proximal to distal during the tarsal elongation (see Fig.S2, Supplemental MovieS2) makes us imagine the influx of hemolymph into the tarsus. It may be possible that the influx of hemolymph contributes to the tarsal elongation by raising inner pressure. Previously, it has been proposed that the tarsal elongation is a result of hydrostatic pressure, according to the fact that the tarsal elongation can be caused by pressing on the abdomen of the prepupa (Fristrom and Fristrom1993). Therefore, hydrostatic pressure may be one of the primary forces driving the tarsal elongation in Stage II. Interestingly, it has been shown that the elongation of the horn during the pupal stage in the beetle is caused by hydrostatic pressure (Matsuda et al.2017). Thus, this may be one of the fundamental mechanisms for the rapid elongation of long, rod-like appendages. Interestingly, it has been reported that the degradation of several basement membrane proteins in Stage I is important for the elongation and cell shape changes (Diaz-de-la-Loza et al.2018). Therefore, the combination of the release of epithelial cells from the constraining force provided by the basement membrane and the increase in hydrostatic pressure may be important. Epithelial cells comprising the Parthenon-like structure apically align the most of their cell body containing the nuclei, elongate the cytoplasmic process in a basal direction, and connect with each other at the basal end to form a thin layer, making the cavity in the epithelial cell layer (see Fig.3). Each epithelial cell protrudes one or two processes, and the processes of neighboring cells bundle together to form the pillar. This is reminiscent of neurons extending axons and forming axon bundles. Thus, it might be possible that just as neurons extend axons and then connect with other cells, epithelial cells protrude processes first and then form the basal connection. When observing the initial step of the Parthenon-like structure formation, however, we found that the basal connection between epithelial cells already formed in the very beginning (see Fig.3D–F). This may indicate that epithelial cells are basally connected before initiating the Parthenon-like structure formation and protrude processes while maintaining the connection, unlike neurons. Since actin, microtubule, and Myo II were abundantly found in the pillars of the Parthenon-like structure (see Fig.S4), cytoskeletal regulation may actively contribute to the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure by controlling elongation and retraction of the pillars. As for the formation of the Parthenon-like structure, another but not exclusive idea is the contribution of the basement membrane. Evidence that the basement membrane actively contributes to tissue shape has been accumulating recently (reviewed in Morrissey and Sherwood2015; Pastor-Pareja2020; Töpfer2023). In the case of our observation on the tarsal development, both the basal surface of epithelial cells and the basement membrane initially showed a mesh-like pattern, and they shrank to form the membranous structure without holes during the reduction of the luminal diameter (see Fig.4). This may indicate that changes in the composition of the basement membrane produce a force to pull epithelial cells toward the basal side and contribute to the elongation of the pillars, i.e., the formation of the Parthenon-like structure. Before Stage II, the tarsal joints of the adult leg are prefigured by the folding of the epithelium. Interestingly, our observation showed that the epithelial folding is resolved by the end of Stage II and reappears during Stage III along with the disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure. This raises the question of how the identity of the joint regions is maintained. Notch signaling and its target genes such asAP-2anddysfusionare required for both the early folding and the later refolding. Accordingly, the expression of Notch ligands or its target genes in the joint regions is detected prior to the early folding as well as prior to the later refolding (de Celis et al.1998; Kerber et al.2001; Córdoba and Estella2014; Tajiri et al.2011). These insights are consistent with a model in which continuous Notch signaling in the joint regions, maintained by sustained expression of the ligands, regulates both the early folding and the later refolding. Meanwhile, considering the extensive cell dynamics during the long interval between the two phases of folding, the possibility that Notch activity is remodeled or refined during the interval cannot be excluded. The present study will be the basis for unraveling how cell identities are maintained in the face of dynamic cell behaviors. In Stage II, macrophage-like cells were observed entering the lumen of the elongating tarsus from the proximal side and spreading distally (see Fig.S2, Supplemental MovieS2). This observation may indicate that macrophage-like cells that originate outside the leg come with the hemolymph flow. After entering the tarsal lumen, macrophage-like cells continued to reside and were actively moving around in the lumen (see Supplemental MovieS3). When the Parthenon-like structure is formed, they intruded into and moved around in the cavity (see Fig.7, Supplemental MovieS13). Within the cavity, they phagocytosed epithelial cells with caspase activity (see Fig.7A–I’). According to these observations, macrophage-like cells might be involved in controlling cell number by phagocytosing excess cells. Making the cavity within the epithelial cell layer by forming the Parthenon-like structure might help macrophage-like cells engulf epithelial cells. Previously, it has been reported that the depletion of hemocytes by specifically inducing cell death results in severe morphological defects, such as truncation in legs (Arefin et al.2015). Macrophage-like cells may also play another role in tarsal morphogenesis besides the trimming of excess cells. The Parthenon-like structure does not seem to be a special structure observed only in the tarsus. We found it also in other leg segments (Fig.S5A). Moreover, a similar structure could be observed in the head region and the notum region (Fig.S5B-E). In the wing, epithelial cells in the pupal stage are known to form similar shapes with epithelial cells in the Parthenon-like structure, in which cell bodies are aligned apically and protrude the thin process basally, although the structure of the basal side seems to be different from the Parthenon-like structure (Waddington1940; Fristrom et al.1993; Sun et al.2021; Tran et al.2024). Furthermore, in the pupal wing of lepidopteran insects, epithelial cells with similar protrusion and hemocytes moving around between them have been reported (Nardi and Magee-Adams1986; Kodama et al.1995; Ohno and Otaki2015; McDougal et al.2021). Other than the wing, structures resembling the Parthenon-like structure have also been found in the prepupal abdominal epidermis and developing pupal antennae of Lepidoptera (Delhanty and Locke1989; Ando et al.2011). Therefore, the transient formation of the Parthenon-like structure appears to be one of the essential processes of final shape formation by epithelial cells at least in insects. Further study on the mechanism of the transient formation of the Parthenon-like structure and its role in morphogenesis will help to better understand the mechanisms of final shape formation.

The team used time-lapse microscopy to image the live cells of fruit flies and found a new structure, which forms and disappears in the final stages of a common fruit fly’s development, that appears to help guide a section of the fly’s leg into its final shape. The findings could lead to better understanding the mechanisms determining an insect body’s shape, as well as providing insight into processes shaping the bodies of other organisms.
In the current study, the research team set out to clarify how certain cells determine an organism’s final shape, using fruit fly leg development as a model. By imaging the live cells of the common fruit flyDrosophila melanogasterover several days to analyze changes in the cells during the last stages of development, the researchers found a transient structure in the fly’s leg involved in determining the limb’s final shape. They named this formation the “Parthenon-like structure” because of a resemblance to the ancient Greek ruin.
“Cells change their shape more dramatically than ever thought during the final shape formation process,” said co-author Tetsuya Kojima, associate professor in the Department of Integrated Biosciences at the University of Tokyo’s Graduate School of Frontier Sciences. “Especially in the case of the fruit fly’s leg, cells transiently form the fascinating structure. Because the Parthenon-like structure is seen in tissues other than the leg and seems to appear in other insects, its transient formation may be a fundamental process that forms the final shape of the insect’s body.”
According to the researchers, the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination — how cells figure out which genes to express and contribute to the organism’s developed form — are conserved among closely related species. However, how these cells contribute to the form’s shape has remained elusive.
“Since shapes can differ dramatically between closely related species that are expected to share the basic mechanisms of cell fate determination, differences in final shape formation processes should greatly contribute to making the shape differences,” said co-author Reiko Tajiri, a researcher at the University of Tokyo at the time of the study and currently associate professor at Chiba University in Japan. “Understanding the mechanisms of final shape formation is of great importance to understanding the mechanisms of formation and diversification of organisms’ shapes.”
To understand the mechanisms of final shape formation, the researchers used an inverted confocal microscope — which images the specimens from underneath and allows for clearer visuals — to image the developing legs of fruit flies over several days. They specifically focused on the tarsus, or the segment of leg farthest from an insect’s body. The tarsus can appear flat and wide in male diving beetles or long and slender in mosquitoes. The tarsus also contains its own segments, which differ significantly across species.
“This diversity in morphology (form and structure) makes the insect tarsus a good model for studying the mechanisms of final shape formation and its diversification,” Kojima said. “In this study, we found unexpected and dramatic shape changes in epithelial cells — cells that line the surface of structures — and the basement membrane, which give rise to the structures that differentiate into the tarsal segments. We also saw interesting behavior of macrophage-like cells, which typically help clean up waste cells.”
Capturing nearly the whole shaping process of the adult tarsus during the fly’s pupal stage, the researchers observed that the epithelial cells changed from a column shape to be more cubelike. They said the cells further changed to “dramatically” form the unexpected, transient Parthenon-like structure. As that structure forms and then disappears, the tarsus’s diameter reduces rapidly. Following the reduction in diameter, the layer of epithelial cells thinned out.
“Our results contribute to elucidating the mechanism for the final shape formation of the adult tarsus,” Kojima said, noting that the team is now studying the formation and disappearance of the Parthenon-like structure in more detail to better understand how it contributes to making the final leg shape.
